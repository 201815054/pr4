Euro zone manufacturing activity accelerated in August, clocking the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011 despite a strengthening currency, a business survey showed.
Along with evidence of slowly-rising pricing power for businesses, the data may bolster confidence in the European Central Bank to make - and go ahead with - plans to reel back its massive asset purchases program later this year.
IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.4 in August, in line with the preliminary reading and up from 56.6 in July.
The latest factory PMI matched where it was in June, which was the highest since April 2011 and well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
Strong manufacturing growth was recorded broadly across all major euro zone economies, with German factory activity also rising to the best since early 2011.
""The euro zone's impressive manufacturing upturn regained momentum in August, with a summer surge in factory activity suggesting rising goods production will support another strong GDP reading in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, in a release.
""Producers across the region are benefiting from rising domestic demand as economic recoveries gain momentum, as well as surging export sales.""
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday, jumped to 58.3 from 56.5 in July, and slightly higher than the flash estimate of 58.1. The backlogs of work index rose to an 11-year high, a good sign for future output.
Solid euro zone growth this year has led to expectations for the ECB to move away from its ultra-easy policy and has pushed the euro over 12 percent higher against the dollar in 2017.
Still, the export orders sub-index, which also includes trade within the euro area, rose to the highest in 6-1/2 years to 58.5 in August, in line with the flash estimate and up sharply from 56.8 in July.
That improvement in demand was for products from across the nations in the euro zone broadly, with German export orders rising at the fastest pace since May 2010.
The survey also showed price pressures strengthened a bit in August with input costs rising the fastest since May and output prices increasing at a faster rate than in the previous month.
Euro zone inflation rose more than expected to 1.5 percent in August, according to official data published on Thursday.

But inflation in the 19-country currency bloc is well below the central bank's target of just below 2 percent and wage pressures have remained largely absent.

Out of 42 economists polled by Reuters, 41 forecast the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would stand pat at its policy meeting on September 5.
The RBA eased twice last year but has since held steady as it balances the risk of fuelling further borrowing in the country's red-hot property market against tepid inflation. 

While the majority predicted the central bank would keep rates steady until the middle of next year, 16 of 28 respondents forecast that it would tighten by December next year, against one who expects an easing.

The poll of 19 analysts forecast a current account surplus of around 2 trillion Japanese yen ($18 billion) in July from 935 billion yen in June. 
""Although the trade surplus likely shrank, a softer yen from a year earlier likely inflated income from overseas investment,"" an analyst at Shinkin Central Bank said in the survey.
Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, says Japan will likely maintain a current account surplus this year because of more upbeat economic conditions overseas.
""Interest rates and stock prices overseas are higher than those of Japan, so interest revenue and investment income are expected to rise."" 
The finance ministry will announce the data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Friday (2350 GMT Thursday).
Japan's trade and current account surpluses have been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump in his ""America First"" campaigning. 
Japan's exports rose for an eighth straight month in July on robust shipments to the United States and a boost from a weak yen.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 09:50PM ET</span>",China August factory activity picks up to six-month high as orders surge: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, Sept 1 (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in six months in August, a private survey showed on Friday, buoyed by a surge in export orders and higher prices. 
Total new business grew at the strongest rate in more than three years, while export orders saw the sharpest increase in over seven years, pointing to robust demand at home and abroad. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.6 in August, compared with 51.1 in July and beating economists' expectations for a slight dip to 50.9.
The reading remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the third straight month.
The Caixin readings followed a similarly stronger-than-expected official manufacturing survey on Thursday, though the official reading had shown a softening in export orders for Chinese goods.
The private survey tends to focus on smaller firms while the official PMI covers mostly larger firms, many of them state-owned manufacturers. 
In line with the official survey, Caixin's PMI also showed stronger increases in input and output prices, with companies passing on price increases to their customers.
Prices of industrial commodities and building materials, in particular, have surged in China this year due to a year-long construction boom and government efforts to reduce excess capacity by shutting inefficient and heavily polluting mines and mills.
The survey also showed manufacturers stepped up purchases of parts and materials for the third straight month as orders continued to increase, with business confidence hitting a five-month highs.
""Overall operating conditions of the manufacturing sector improved further as market demand strengthens, but if prices rise too quickly the profitability of companies in the middle of a supply chain may be under pressure."" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release.
Futures prices for steel reinforcing bars used in construction have risen around 11 percent so far this month and 51 percent this year.
While the Caixin output reading slipped slightly, the new export orders sub-index surged to 54.6, the highest reading since March 2010. 
After a two-year slump, China's exports have rebounded this year on the back of strong global demand while avoiding any major pitfalls from rising protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump.
China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half, with exports and retail sales adding to the momentum from an infrastructure building spree and record lending by state-controlled banks last year.
And while China watchers still maintain the economy will start to lose some steam eventually, as higher financing costs for companies and a cooling property market start to weigh on activity, some are starting to raise growth expectations for the year.
Moody's said on Wednesday that surprisingly strong data in the first half of the year had prompted it to raise its 2017 growth forecast for China to 6.8 percent from 6.6 percent.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) inched up to 52.2 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, less than a flash reading of 52.8 but just above a final 52.1 in July.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 12th consecutive month.
Japan's economy expanded by a much stronger-than-expected annualized rate of 4.0 percent in April-June, the fastest in more than two years.
But signs of softening in June and July, particularly for export orders, had raised concerns that global demand may be faltering after a strong start to the year.
The latest survey showed orders picking up again in August, though the increase was modest and not as strong as the preliminary reading had suggested.
The final index for new orders was 51.9, well below the preliminary index of 52.7 and only slightly higher than a final 51.8 in July. 
The index for new export orders was also revised down to 51.3 from a flash reading of 52.2. That compares with a final 50.9 in the previous month.
""(The) survey showed growth moving broadly sideways, maintaining the recent positive trend of improvement in the health of the manufacturing sector,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Input prices continued to rise sharply though only 4 percent of the companies surveyed said they were able to pass on some of the increase to consumers, a further setback for the Bank of Japan's efforts to reach its elusive 2 percent inflation target. ] 
The final PMI data come one day after government data showed industrial output fell more than expected in July as manufacturers curbed output of electrical machinery.

Manufacturers said they expected output to rise in August and fall in September, suggesting factory activity is losing a little momentum after faster gains earlier this year.

The consumer price index rose 2.6 percent in August from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said, accelerating from a 2.2 percent rise in July, and marking its fastest rise since April 2012 when the index also gained 2.6 percent on-year.
It compared to a 2.2 percent rise tipped in a Reuters survey of analysts' expectations. 
""Seasonal factors such as the heatwave, as well as the incident related to contaminated eggs across the country lifted up fresh food prices,"" said Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment.
Kim said the sudden surge in prices was not from an increase in domestic demand, adding that he saw consumer prices remaining volatile through the October shopping season when South Koreans celebrate the national Chuseok holiday. 
The price of eggs soared 53.3 percent in August on-year after eggs from some local farms were found to be contaminated with a potentially harmful pesticide.
The price of radish and tomatoes surged 71.4 percent and 45.3 percent respectively, pushing up the overall price gains of fresh food costs to 18.3 percent on-year.
In monthly terms, inflation gained 0.6 percent from July.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, was 1.8 percent in August, unchanged from July.
Inflation this year has lingered near the Bank of Korea's inflation target of 2 percent as private consumption has improved.

Revised second quarter gross domestic product growth data issued released earlier on Friday showed the economy expanded 0.6 percent from a quarter earlier versus 1.1 percent growth in the first quarter.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 04:50PM ET</span>",Brazil consumers drive recovery as investment lags,"By Bruno Federowski
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian policymakers and economists have for years promised that a surge in corporate investment would lift Latin America's largest economy out of its worst recession. Investors are not buying it.
While consumers are loosening their purse strings, Brazilian companies must deal with heavy debt loads and employ idle capacity before they boost investment in new machines or facilities, economic data shows.
Instead the economic recovery has some investors betting that consumer-facing firms - such as retailers, healthcare companies and apparel makers - are better positioned to benefit from Brazil's first economic growth in three years, outperforming heavy industry.
That defies expectations that an upswing in capital spending would lay the groundwork for the recovery, fueled by President Michel Temer's business-friendly reforms as well as sharp interest rate cuts.
After private investment fell 30 percent since 2013, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles forecast in June that it would recover faster than consumer spending. 
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had also stressed the case for an investment-driven recovery while Itaú BBA analysts recommended buying stocks in the capital goods sector this year.
That story is now looking far-fetched.
Marcelo Toledo, chief economist at Bradesco Asset Management, said households have already turned the corner on cutting debt but companies are only are only a quarter of the way toward cleaning up their balance sheets after the crisis.
Net debt at 263 listed companies tracked by financial data provider Economática has declined 16 percent from a 2015 peak but is still more than double what it was five years ago. 
In contrast, household debt as a percentage of income has returned to levels last seen in 2011, central bank data showed.
Business leaders may also be shelving capital spending plans until after a wide-open 2018 presidential race, with several populist candidates in the wings.
""As long as companies prioritize deleveraging, they will not pursue any new investments,"" he said. ""It will take a long time before investments return to levels needed to fuel growth rates of 3 percent or 4 percent.""
CONSUMERS VS INDUSTRY
Some investors are catching on. 
An index tracking retailers and consumer goods companies on the São Paulo Exchange (ICON) is up 23 percent this year. The median net revenue of those companies rose 6 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, the biggest rise in a year and a half, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings statements.
On the other hand, the bourse's industrial index (INDX) rose just 12 percent, lagging an 18 percent increase by the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP). 
Industrial companies saw net revenue slip 2 percent in the three months through June, the fifth straight quarter of decline.
Alexandre Silvério, who manages 1.9 billion reais of stocks as head of equities at AZ Quest Investimentos Ltda, said he is banking on consumer goods and retailers to outperform other sectors in the coming quarters. 
""Those are the big winners,"" Silvério said.
With demand recovering slowly and debt levels forcing players in several sectors to sell assets, many firms are prioritizing mergers and acquisitions over new capital spending as a means to expand.
Investment has fallen to levels barely enough to maintain capacity. Capital spending at companies covered by Fitch Ratings amounted to only 1.1 times depreciation in 2016, compared to 2.2 times four years earlier.
To cut its huge debt, oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) has sold assets and cut its five-year investment plan — the world's largest program of its kind in 2012 at nearly $250 billion — to less than $100 billion. 
Steelmaker Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais SA (SA:USIM5) is using just 60 percent of its capacity after investing 14 billion reais from 2008 to 2014 in plants that came on line in the middle of Brazil's recession and a global steel crisis. 
""Our focus now is what to do to get all our installed capacity working,"" Chief Executive Sergio Leite said last month, commenting on capital spending that has fallen to around 250 million reais per year.
Meanwhile, employment and retail sales data have shown an upswing in recent months, leading economists to raise forecasts for this year. 
Brazil's GDP is expected to grow 0.4 percent in 2017, according to a central bank survey of economists, after shrinking 8 percent over the prior two years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose slightly less than expected in July and annual inflation advanced at its slowest pace in more than 1-1/2 years, diminishing expectations of an interest rate increase in December.
Inflation remains stubbornly low even as the labor market is near full employment, a conundrum for the Federal Reserve. Other data on Thursday showed a small increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week amid a tightening job market.
""The consumer continues to do the heavy lifting when it comes to economic growth,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Inflation is in the slow lane for now and this is likely to make Fed officials cautious on the need to raise rates a third time this year."" 
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 percent last month after a 0.2 percent gain in June. Economists had forecast consumer spending rising 0.4 percent in July.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy edged up 0.1 percent in July. The so-called core PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has now risen by the same margin for three straight months.
The 12-month increase in the core PCE price index dipped to 1.4 percent, the smallest gain since December 2015. The index rose 1.5 percent in the 12 months through June. The annual rate has dropped by half a percentage point since February and the PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for the past five years.
The combination of moderate consumer spending and tepid inflation casts doubts on whether the Fed will increase interest rates at its December policy meeting, as most economists expect.
The Fed has raised borrowing costs twice this year. It is, however, expected to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities next month.
""We expect core inflation to get worse on a year-over-year basis before it gets better, making it an easy decision for the Fed to skip raising rates at its September meeting and focus on the balance sheet only,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. 
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 31 percent probability of a rate increase at the Fed's December meeting, down from about 35 percent earlier, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on the diminishing rate hike prospects, as were prices of U.S. Treasuries. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
The consumer spending report still suggested the economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter after gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, the fastest in more than two years.
Growth in the second quarter was buoyed by robust consumer spending. The continuing strength of the labor market should support consumer spending.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 236,000 for the week ended Aug. 26.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell by 1,250 to 236,750 last week, the lowest reading since May.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market, for 130 consecutive weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
In July, consumer spending was lifted by a 0.4 percent rebound in personal income after being unchanged in June. Consumers also tapped into savings, which fell to a seven-month low of $510.2 billion from $515.7 billion in the prior month.
While consumers will continue to drive the economy, housing will probably remain a drag. 
A third report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously-owned homes fell in July, the fourth drop in five months. Housing is being hurt by an acute shortage of properties available for sale. 
""The latest figures ... come at a time when much of the housing data have turned weaker,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We will likely see the softness in at least some of the housing data persist over the next month or two.""

In a fourth report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its MNI Chicago Business index was unchanged at a reading of 58.9 in August.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, declined 0.8 percent to a reading of 109.1. June was also revised slightly lower to a reading of 110.0.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.5 percent last month. Across the country's four regions, contracts only rose in the West.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 1.3 percent.
Pending home contracts become sales one or two months later, and last month's decline is the latest in an uneven run of housing data. Housing demand has been buoyed by a strengthening economy and low unemployment, but a lack of inventory has pushed up prices.
""The pace of new listings is not catching up with what's being sold at an astonishingly fast pace,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
Pending home sales in the West edged up 0.6 percent in July. They declined 0.3 percent in the Northeast, 0.7 percent in the Midwest and 1.7 percent in the South.
Yun added that the impact from Hurricane Harvey on the Houston region, with homeowners suffering extensive flooding, would likely weigh on sales over the coming months.

Year-on-year, pending home sales fell at an annualized rate of 1.3% in July.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun blamed the decline on the staggering inventory woes throughout the country continue to stall contract activity.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose more than expected in August, official data showed on Thursday, just as the European Central Bank prepares to debate whether to tighten policy after 2-1/2 years of unprecedented stimulus.
Inflation in the 19-country currency bloc, targeted by the ECB at just below 2 percent, accelerated to 1.5 percent in August from 1.3 percent, coming just ahead of expectations for 1.4 percent on the back of higher energy costs, Eurostat said on Thursday.
Underlying inflation, or prices excluding volatile food and energy costs, a figure closely watched by ECB policymakers, held steady at 1.3 percent, beating forecasts for 1.2 percent.
While the figures may strengthen the case of conservative policymakers, who are pushing for the ECB to wind down its asset-buying next year, the ECB is also now dealing with a strengthening euro, which pushes down prices. 
Launched 2-1/2 years ago when the threat of deflation appeared real and imminent, the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro bond purchase scheme is due to expire at the end of the year, and policymakers promised to decide this ""autumn"" whether to extend the purchases or wind them down. 
The euro zone economy is now growing for the 17th straight quarter, but wage growth is still paltry and sizable slack in the labour market suggests that wage inflation, a vital ingredient for overall inflation, may be sometime away, an argument for some policymakers to continue with stimulus.
Indeed, unemployment held steady at 9.1 percent in July, Eurostat said separately, with France, Spain and Italy all above the euro zone average. 
ECB MEETS 
ECB policymakers will next meet on Sept. 7 and while few specific decision are expected, ECB President Mario Draghi could start laying the ground for the bank's next move for when they meet on Oct 26.
A complication is the euro's  13 percent rise against the dollar this year, which could dampen inflation by reducing the cost of exports, and may slow growth by making euro zone export more expensive.
Tightening policy would also make the euro more attractive.
Indeed, policymakers already expressed concern about the euro's appreciation when they met in July, the minutes of that meeting showed, warning about the dangers of an ""overshooting"" currency.
Sources told Reuters this week rapid gains by the euro against the dollar are worrying a growing number of policymakers at the ECB, raising the chance its asset purchases will be phased out only slowly.
Speaking at the U.S. Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference last week, ECB President Mario Draghi argued that while growth has taken hold, patience was still needed for inflation to rise to target. 

He said that inflation will move towards target once growth accelerates and the so-called output gap closes but warned that ""we have to be very patient"" as low productivity growth and the labour market slack will take considerable time to be resolved.

19,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 05:00AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation rises more than expected in August,"Investing.com – Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the euro zone climbed more than expected in August, official preliminary data showed on Thursday.
In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% in August, above expectations for an increase of 1.4% and compared a final reading of a 1.3% advance in the prior month. That was its highest level since April of this year.
According to Eurostat, and looking at the main components of euro area inflation, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in August (4.0%, compared with 2.2% in July), followed by services (1.6%, stable compared with July), food, alcohol & tobacco (1.4%, stable compared with July) and non-energy industrial goods (0.5%, stable compared with July).
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in August, from the same period a year ago. That was in line forecasts and the prior month’s reading.
The European Central Bank’s inflation target is officially close to, but below, 2.0% and will make its next monetary policy decision on September 7.
Though markets do not expect a rate hike until well into 2018, they will be looking for clues from ECB president Mario Draghi on when the euro zone monetary authority plans to begin tapering its asset purchase program, currently set to expire at the end of the year.
After the report, EUR/USD was at 1.1904 compared to 1.1890 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP traded at 0.9230 compared to 0.9221 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.45%, Germany's DAX advanced 0.49%, France’s CAC 40 traded up 0.49%, while London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.59%."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices are forecast to rise by a cumulative 10 percent over this year and next, driven by a scarcity of new homes, low interest rates and steadily-increasing demand, a Reuters poll of property market analysts showed.
Over three-quarters of the experts surveyed Aug. 17-30 also said the U.S. home ownership rate, which a year ago was languishing at a four-decade low, will climb over the next two years.
The survey results suggest the steady recovery from a housing market crisis that first started about a decade ago - when homes lost almost a third of their value and unemployment surged - is expected to continue.
The latest poll coincides with a series of weak housing data releases. U.S. home resales and starts fell in July to their lowest levels in nearly a year on a chronic shortage of properties even as home borrowing costs are down broadly.
But the cooling in housing turnover reflects supply bottlenecks rather than falling demand.
""The recent drop in mortgage interest rates has not boosted housing market activity, which is being constrained by a severe lack of inventory,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics.
""With housing starts faltering, we doubt inventory levels will improve much this year, so home sales will see little growth. Instead, prices are set to be driven up.""
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of prices in 20 metropolitan areas is forecast to rise at more than double the rate of inflation and wage growth this year, by 5.7 percent, followed by 4.3 percent next year.
Those median forecasts were slightly up from a Reuters poll three months ago. The range of forecasts also showed a shift up from a poll in May, with higher highs and higher lows.
While U.S. house prices have regained all of their losses from the financial crisis and the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low, housing inventory is still at just half of where it was at its peak in 2007, at the start of the crisis.
Housing inventory has now dropped for 26 straight months on a year-over-year basis, pushing house prices up. The monthly median house price has risen for almost 5-1/2 years and the latest data show it was up 6.2 percent in July compared with a year ago.
Existing home sales are forecast to average a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.60 million units until the second half of next year, according to the poll, more than a 20 percent drop from the peaks of 2005, suggesting housing shortages are here to stay.
HOME OWNERSHIP ON THE RISE
But with a couple of hundred thousand or so jobs still being added to the economy each month along with extremely low interest rates, building companies are likely to continue constructing homes to capture that solid demand.
Indeed, expectations now are for the home ownership rate to go higher over the next two years.
The home ownership rate, which measures the total number of homes owned by their occupants, hit a 40-year low of 62.9 percent last year. It has since crept up slowly to 63.7 percent, but is still a long way from reaching its recent peak.
""Gradual loosening of credit along with gradually increasing confidence in the housing market will push homeownership rates higher, although nothing close to the 69 percent seen in 2004 during the last housing market up-cycle,"" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at ATTOM Data Solutions, an online property data website.
Rising house prices remain an obstacle for first-time buyers, however, particularly those who are saddled with huge amounts of student debt. 
""Affordability is now at its lowest point of the year and it is happening with sales weakening. That seems to imply that prices are becoming a problem,"" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics.
Asked to rate affordability of U.S. housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. That has not changed in more than a year of polling.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 02:12AM ET</span>",China factory growth unexpectedly speeds up in August in further global boost,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly accelerated in August, suggesting the world's second-largest economy is still expanding at a healthy clip despite rising financing costs and a cooling housing market. 
Along with stronger U.S. economic growth reported overnight, China's official factory readings indicated the global economy remains on solid footing for now, despite concerns that growth may begin to fade in coming months.
China's resilience so far this year has surprised economists and given an extra boost to a global recovery despite Beijing's crackdown on riskier types of lending and ever-tougher curbs to get the overheated housing market under control.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.7 in August from the previous month's 51.4, confounding economists' expectations for a marginal decline. 
Production, total new orders and business expectations all shifted into higher gear, while a separate industry survey showed activity in the steel sector expanded at the fastest pace since April 2016 thanks to a year-long, government-led construction boom.
In particular, a sharp pick-up in input prices bodes well for resource companies' earnings and investment in coming months, ANZ said.
""The price-driven recovery will continue at least in the third quarter"", said Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist for ANZ in Hong Kong.
""On the demand side, infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment continue to maintain (at decent levels)...I see no reason for a sharp downturn even after the fourth quarter this year.""
The sustained rally in industrial commodities' prices largely reflects stronger demand for building materials and government efforts to reduce excess capacity by shutting inefficient and heavily polluting mines and mills. 
Demand is so robust that futures prices for steel reinforcing bars used in construction have surged 9 percent this month and more than 50 percent this year. 
Output prices also rose at the fastest pace since December, indicating strong pricing power for producers, which should fatten profit margins and give firms extra breathing room in the country's fight against a rapid build-up in debt.
""We expect domestic steel production and sales to remain strong in September, with market prices remaining elevated,"" the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP) said in survey on the sector.
DEFYING GRAVITY?
China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half, with resurgent exports and robust retail sales adding to the momentum from the infrastructure building spree and record lending by state-controlled banks last year.
China watchers still maintain the economy will start to lose some altitude eventually, as higher financing costs for companies and homeowners start to drag on activity.
But they do not foresee a sharp slowdown, especially as the government is keen to ensure stability ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party leadership reshuffle in the autumn.
After a strong start to 2017, the government looks certain to comfortably meet or beat its full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent. ANZ is forecasting 6.7 percent.
However, analysts did note a number of areas that bear watching, including a slowdown in new export orders.
A separate official reading on China's services sector showed expansion slowed to 53.4 in August from 54.5 in July, the slowest pace of growth since May 2016, but still comfortably above a reading of 50, which separates growth from contraction.
China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. 
Slower growth was seen in the property and financial sectors, while the information technology, broadcasting and aviation industries expanded strongly, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement along with the data. 
A sub-index for the construction sector fell to 58.0 in August from 62.5 in July.
While still quite robust, the lower reading may suggest the strong economic impulse from the massive government infrastructure spending is starting to fade.
Data for July came in mostly below expectations as growth in imports faltered, while industrial output grew at the slowest pace since early this year. 
""Looking ahead, if we are right to believe that tighter policy will continue to weigh on investment spending in the coming quarters, then we doubt that the current pace of industrial output growth can be sustained for long,"" Capital Economics' economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 
The data on Thursday showed manufacturers cranked up production in August, with a reading of 54.1 from 53.5 in July, while new factory orders rose to 53.1 from 52.8 in July.
That suggested domestic demand picked up, as export orders fell to 50.4, the lowest reading since January and down from the previous month's 50.9.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian business investment rose in the second quarter while companies upgraded their spending plans for the year ahead, reflecting a long-awaited and much-needed revival outside of mining.
Investment grew a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in April-June to nearly A$28.3 billion ($22.37 billion), data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday, beating expectations of a 0.3 percent gain.
Importantly, spending on equipment, plant and machinery climbed 2.7 percent and should add directly to economic growth in the second quarter.
Figures due next week are likely to show Australia's A$1.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by around 0.7 percent, up from a sluggish 0.3 percent in the first quarter.
""The data shows finally a more convincing, stronger picture on the non-mining capex front. I won't be surprised to see consensus estimate for GDP lift from here,"" said Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.
Latest estimates for business investment in the year to June 2018 were revised up sharply to A$101.8 billion, from a previous A$85.4 billion. Spending plans for sectors including utilities, construction and retail trade, were running at record highs.
""Non-mining capex rose for the third straight quarter. I think it's a bit more encouraging than it has been for a while. The fact that its continuing and the plans are a bit stronger is a good sign,"" added Ong.
That would be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has kept interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent since August 2016 hoping that economic growth will accelerate to around 3 percent.
RBA governor Philip Lowe recently reiterated that the drag on Australia's economy from mining was almost over and cutting rates further would only serve to inflate a debt-ridden bubble in the country's housing market.
Other measures of economic growth have also been buoyant. Data on Wednesday showed construction spending boasted its biggest increase on record last quarter.
Separate data on Wednesday offered upbeat news on the outlook for housing construction, a mainstay of the economy in recent years.
Measures of business conditions and confidence have also been trending near decade highs.
""If you get a pick-up in business investment it's a pretty good sign for the economy,"" RBC's Ong said.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2017 09:31PM ET</span>",Japan July factory output falls but growth momentum seen intact,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output fell more than expected in July, pulling back from the previous month's gain, as manufacturers curbed production of general-purpose and electrical machinery in a likely sign of a temporary slowdown in factory activity.
Industrial output fell 0.8 percent in July from the previous month, dragged down by production of semiconductor production equipment, turbines and power generators, preliminary data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Thursday.
The reading compared with the median estimate of a 0.5 percent drop in a Reuters poll of economists, following a 2.2 percent increase in June.
Still, manufacturers forecast factory output would rebound in August, underscoring the view that Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, is on track to extend a growth run in the current quarter on the back of better external and domestic demand.
""Production fell in reaction to June's gains but it remains in a recovery trend,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""Likewise the overall economy will continue a steady expansion in the current quarter, although we cannot expect such robust growth seen in the previous quarter.""
The rainy and cool weather in August may dampen consumer spending in Japan, while in the U.S. - Japan's key export market - damages wrought by hurricane Harvey was a source of concern, Tokuda said.
Besides the weather factors, there's no immediate risk to Japan's growth at least until later this year when China's economy could start to slow, and next year when the ongoing tech boom may peak out, he added.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 6.0 percent in August and decline 3.1 percent in September.
The ministry stuck to its assessment of industrial output, saying production is picking up over time.
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter -- growing at a 4 percent annualized rate -- as consumer and company spending picked up.

Analysts expect the economy to continue growing at a healthy clip in coming quarters, offering the Bank of Japan hope that a tight labor market will finally start to boost wages and consumer spending.

Factory output in July gained 1.9 percent in seasonally adjusted terms, official data showed on Thursday, beating market expectations.
Production of cars and electronic components surged 6.5 percent and 9.4 percent respectively from June.
A 1.9 percent gain in monthly terms is the fastest gain since the index jumped 2.8 percent in January this year.

Stephen Lee, an economist at Samsung Securities Co. said the data appeared to augur well for economic growth.

""Demand for electronic components seems to be supported by Samsung's launch of the Galaxy Note 8, while new car launches by Hyundai Motor Co. also boosted car production.""
The June reading was revised to a 0.5 percent fall from a 0.2 percent decline.
South Korea's industrial output growth this year has been largely uneven and lagging forecasts, prompting fears the manufacturing sector may be losing momentum.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy likely showed further signs of recovery in the latest quarter from a shock cash squeeze late last year, but the rebound is not expected to be strong enough to help it reclaim the crown of the world's fastest-growing major economy.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have expanded 6.6 percent in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, according to economists polled by Reuters. 
That would mark a solid acceleration from 6.1 percent growth in January-March, but still lag China's 6.9 percent print in the latest quarter.
Forecasts ranged from 5.7 to 7.2 percent.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision last November to scrap high-value old banknotes wiped out about 86 percent of currency in circulation virtually overnight, pounding consumer demand.
Since then, high frequency indicators such as sales of two-wheel vehicles, oil consumption, cargo traffic and rail freight have shown the impact of the cash clampdown is gradually fading.
""The economy likely dusted off the post-demonetization lull,"" said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.
Yet, Asia's third-largest economy is far away from firing on all cylinders - capital spending remains weak and debt-laden banks are still circumspect in lending. 
Confusion over a new goods and services tax and high debt levels in rural areas could also dampen activity in coming months.
HEADWINDS
The launch of a national Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1 has caused chaos on the ground as ambiguous rules have left firms confused over how to price their products.
Business surveys showed both services and manufacturing activity contracted at their fastest rate in years in July.
In rural areas, huge inventories of grain from last year's record harvest has led to large declines in prices, leaving millions of farmers in debt.
With restive farmers demanding loan relief, four Indian states have agreed to waive billions of dollars in farm loans. A few more states are contemplating similar write-offs.
The debt waivers come at a time when state finances are under pressure, compelling some of them to slash capital spending to keep their budget deficits in check.
Further clouding the economic outlook is growing stress on corporate balance sheets, frustrating Modi's efforts to revive private investments.
In the telecoms sector, the entry of Reliance Jio has dramatically reduced prices, hitting corporate profits. Similarly, a marked decline in the price of renewable energy has put thermal power companies in a spot.
There is little surprise then that a number of economists including those in the government have begun sounding warnings.
Still, there is a good chance of Thursday's data throwing an upside surprise, thanks to a favorable GDP ""deflator"". The federal statistics office uses the deflator to strip out price changes to make quarters comparable.
The GDP deflator is expected to decline by as much as 200 basis points from the March quarter due to a sharp cooling in inflation, imparting an upside bias to real growth figures. 

The federal statistics office will release the data at 1200 GMT.

The monthly consumer sentiment index from market research firm GfK rose to -10 from -12 in July, confounding expectations for a fall to -13 in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was unclear whether August's rise was significant or merely a ""dead-cat bounce"" in an otherwise declining trend, said GfK, which compiles the survey on behalf of the European Commission.
Britain's economy has had its slowest start to the year since 2012 as consumers have come under pressure from a big rise in inflation since sterling fell after last year's Brexit vote.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2017 03:36PM ET</span>","U.S. second-quarter GDP growth revised up, fastest in over two years","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its quickest pace in more than two years, and there are signs that the momentum was sustained at the start of the third quarter. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate on Wednesday. The upward revision from the 2.6 percent pace reported last month reflected robust consumer spending as well as strong business investment.
Growth last quarter was the best since the first quarter of 2015 and followed a 1.2 percent pace in the January-March period. Economists had expected that second-quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 2.7 percent rate.
Retail sales and business spending data so far suggest the economy maintained its stamina early in the third quarter. Economists saw a limited impact on growth from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas.
""The impact on the national economy will be minor,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh. ""While some output will be lost in the wake of the storm, most of the difference will be made up in the months ahead.""
Growth estimates for the third quarter are as high as a 3.4 percent rate. Other data on Wednesday showed private employers ramped up hiring in August, adding 237,000 jobs to their payrolls. That was up from 201,000 jobs in July.
The ADP National Employment Report was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which is expected to show solid job gains in August and diminishing labor market slack.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks rose.
Strong growth and a labor market that is near full employment support views the Federal Reserve will announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities next month and increase interest rates in December.
With GDP quickening in the second quarter, the economy grew 2.1 percent in the first half of 2017. While that was up from the 1.9 percent reported last month, economists said it was unlikely growth this year would breach Republican President Donald Trump's ambitious 3.0 percent target.
""Underlying domestic demand in the economy is consistent with near three percent growth but the supply-side of the economy is not capable of delivering such a pace of growth at this point,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The Trump administration is targeting tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending to boost growth. However, it has so far failed to pass any economic legislation and is yet to articulate plans for tax reform and infrastructure. 
Chances are slim that the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress will debate and pass tax reform legislation before the end of the year. Touting the second-quarter growth pace, Trump said on Wednesday he was ready to work with Congress on tax reform.
""This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard-working Americans and I am fully committed to work with Congress to get this job done and I don't want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand?"" Trump said at an event in Springfield, Missouri.
So far, the political gridlock in Washington has not hurt either business or consumer confidence.
ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING 
Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at a 3.3 percent rate, the fastest in a year, reflecting more spending on motor vehicles, cellphones, housing and utilities than previously estimated.
That was revised up from the 2.8 percent pace reported in July and accounted for the bulk of the pickup in economic growth in the second quarter.
But stronger consumer spending came at the expense of saving amid sluggish wage gains. The saving rate slipped to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent in the first quarter. The second-quarter saving rate was previously reported at 3.8 percent. 
Households cannot, however, continue to rely on savings indefinitely to fund their consumption. This raises doubts on the sustainability of the robust pace of consumer spending.
Despite the acceleration in consumer spending, inflation remained benign in the second quarter. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 0.9 percent rate as previously reported. 
Last quarter's rise was the slowest in more than two years and followed a 1.8 percent rate of increase in the first quarter.
Businesses helped to carry the economy in the second quarter, in part buoyed by a rebound in corporate profits. Spending on equipment jumped at a rate of 8.8 percent. That was the fastest in nearly two years and was an upward revision to the 8.2 percent pace reported last month.
Investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 6.2 percent pace, rather than the previously reported 4.9 percent rate. Inventory investment had a neutral effect on second-quarter GDP as previously reported after chopping off 1.46 percentage points from output in the first quarter. Trade added two-tenths of a percentage point to growth. Housing was a drag on growth in the last quarter, with investment on homebuilding recording its worst performance in nearly seven years. 

Government spending contracted for a second straight quarter, weighed down by decreasing state and local government investment. Motor vehicle production rebounded after two straight quarters of declines.

Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dipped to 4.11 percent, a fresh nine-month low, from 4.12 percent the prior week, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC). 
The average rate on 15-year mortgages fell to 3.36 percent, the lowest since November, from 3.40 percent the prior week.
Average rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were little changed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian construction spending boasted its biggest rise on record last quarter as miners splashed out on major engineering projects, a surprise that could lift economic growth well above initial expectations.
Wednesday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed construction work done surged 9.3 percent in the second quarter, from the first quarter. That was the largest increase ever and dwarfed forecasts for a rise of just 1 percent.
The increase amounted to a whopping A$4.4 billion ($3.51 billion) in inflation adjusted dollars, implying an addition to gross domestic product growth of more than 1 percentage point.
A rebound would be welcome given weather disruptions kept growth to a pedestrian 0.3 percent in the first quarter. Data for GDP are due next week and analysts were now considering whether to lift their estimates.
""I think there is a good chance we would bump up our GDP forecasts,"" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at CBA.
""We have had some very solid numbers and in areas we really didn't expect to see - in engineering and in Western Australia,"" he added. ""An infrastructure lift is coming through in Victoria and New South Wales, so that's quite encouraging too.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already factored in a bounce in activity in its economic outlook, one reason it is expected to keep interest rates steady for the rest of the year.
Construction spending in the mining-heavy state of Western Australia alone jumped 56 percent in the second quarter.
That concentration led analysts to suspect much of the increase might be tied to Shell (LON:RDSa)'s investment in a floating liquefied natural gas platform - the largest such facility.
If so, the vessel would be recorded as an import at some point and thus subtract from national GDP, muddying the overall impact on the economy.
The ABS provides no detail on spending by individual companies or on particular projects.
Separate data from the agency out on Wednesday offered upbeat news on the outlook for housing construction, a mainstay of the economy in recent years.
Approvals to build new homes dipped 1.7 percent in July to unwind only a little of June's hefty 11.7 percent jump. Analysts had thought approvals might retreat by 5 percent or more.

With approvals now holding at historically high levels, any future slowdown in construction looks set to be milder than many had feared.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports were expected to rise for a 10th straight month in August, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, as global demand for tech products remained robust although renegotiation of a key trade pact with the United States may add to future risk.
The median forecast of the 12 analysts polled was for exports to rise 14.3 percent from a year ago, slowing from 19.5 percent growth in July. Import growth was seen slowing to 11.4 percent after rising 14.5 percent in July. 
""Exports to the United States probably improved, helping strong exports in the IT sector to continue, but renegotiation of the free trade agreement may hurt shipments going there in the future,"" said Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment. 
South Korea and the United States held a one-day video conference last week to discuss how to move forward in talks on the trade pact, but failed to reach a decision.
July exports to China and the United States rose 6.6 percent and 7 percent respectively versus a year ago. China is South Korea's biggest trade partner.
Shipments to the European Union rose by 10.2 percent.
The same poll found that year-on-year inflation for August was expected to be 2.2 percent, unchanged from July. 
Respondents said a decline in global oil prices was offset by rising rises for agricultural products caused by heavy rain, keeping inflation unchanged. 
Factory output was forecast to increase 0.5 percent on-month in July after shedding 0.2 percent in June. July's more bullish outlook was attributed to robust exports of semiconductors, petroleum products, and possibly cars as well. 

The industrial output data is due on Thursday, with the trade and inflation indicators to be published on Friday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales growth slowed in July as shoppers spent less on clothes and cars, but economists remain optimistic that consumer spending will soon gather pace due to a tight labor market.
Separate data on Tuesday showed household spending unexpectedly fell in July, which has injected some caution into the debate about whether domestic demand can continue to drive growth.
Nonetheless, retail sales did grow for a ninth consecutive month in July, suggesting the underlying trend for consumption remains healthy.
Some economists say retail sales could fall in August as heavy rains kept people indoors. Spending is likely to quickly resume growth as strong labor demand boosts consumer sentiment, economists say, although tensions with North Korea may undermine that confidence.
""Retail sales can remain in gradual recovery, but it is difficult to maintain the high pace of growth seen earlier this year,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The weather in August was not good. However, I'm not pessimistic because the labor market is tight.""
Retail sales rose 1.9 percent in July from a year ago, which was more than the median estimate for a 1.0 percent annual increase but still slower than a revised 2.2 percent increase in the year to May.
Spending on clothes rose 3.5 percent in July from a year ago, which was slower than a 5.3 percent annual increase in June, data from the trade ministry showed on Wednesday.
Spending growth on cars also slowed to an annual 6.6 percent in July from 8.7 percent in the previous month.
Demand for labor rose to the highest in 43-1/2 years in July, data showed on Tuesday, supporting optimism in the outlook for domestic demand.

North Korea's launch of a missile over Japan in the early hours of Tuesday rattled financial markets and could start to weigh on Japan's consumer sentiment if the standoff over its nuclear program worsens.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK retailers see Brexit hit to consumers without detailed customs plans,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers could face higher prices and less choice unless Britain and the European Union can agree how to handle thorny issues like haulage and food safety after Brexit, an industry body said on Wednesday.
While Britain's government has already outlined its broad vision for a future customs agreement with the EU, the British Retail Consortium said it was still waiting for crucial details around the trade of consumer goods.
It called for significant investment in ports and transport infrastructure so new systems are ready when Brexit takes place in March 2019, as well as agreements to prevent goods being held up at the border because of extra checks.
""Whilst the government has acknowledged the need to avoid a cliff-edge after Brexit day, a customs union in itself won't solve the problem of delays at ports,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.
""So to ensure supply chains are not disrupted and goods continue to reach the shelves, agreements on security, transit, haulage, drivers, (sales taxes) and other checks will be required to get systems ready for March 2019.""
The BRC's report is the latest in a string of appeals from industry groups for more clarity about how trade and immigration will operate in practice after Brexit. 
Nearly half of businesses operating in Britain's food supply chain say European Union workers are thinking about leaving because of uncertainty around Brexit, according to a survey last week conducted by several trade bodies.
Earlier this month Britain outlined two possible approaches to a new customs relationship with the EU after leaving the bloc and its customs union.
It described a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"" that would borrow from existing systems while expanding the use of technology, or a new customs partnership that could mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world.
The proposals were dismissed as ""fantasy"" by one senior EU official. 
Separately, the BRC reported British shop prices fell 0.3 percent in August compared with a year ago, following a contraction of 0.4 percent in July, pointing to a growing financial squeeze on British households.
Prices for non-food goods declined at the slowest rate since April 2013.
""The reality is that with protection from hedging policies coming to an end, non-food retailers are running out of options for protecting shoppers from the significant increases in the price of imported goods since the EU referendum in June last year,"" Dickinson from the BRC said.

""We expect non-food prices to continue trending toward year on year inflation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S consumer confidence surged to a five-month high in August as households grew increasingly upbeat about the labor market while house prices rose further in June, suggesting a recent acceleration in consumer spending was likely to be sustained.
The data on Tuesday also supported views that economic growth would accelerate in the second half of the year after a sluggish performance earlier.
""Despite a daily dose of worrying headlines, consumers still have plenty to be confident about right now. Home prices are rising, stocks are just off record highs and the labor market is churning out jobs,"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""That should continue to support solid consumer spending growth through the rest of the year.""
  The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 122.9 this month from 120.0 in July. That was the strongest reading since March when the index hit a 16-year high of 124.9. August was also the second highest reading since 2000.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the best in 16 years.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with further absorption of labor market slack. The labor market is near full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent.
Strong consumer confidence bodes well for consumer spending, which accelerated in the second quarter after slowing at the start of the year. It also provides a boost to the economy after it grew 1.9 percent in the first half of the year.
The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were little changed after earlier rising on safe-haven buying after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan's northern Hokkaido island into the sea. Stocks on Wall Street were marginally lower.
BULLISH CONSUMERS
Economists said bullish consumer optimism, together with the tightening labor market, were compelling reasons for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates again this year despite worries about persistently low inflation.
""Consumers seem very confident in their ability to find a new job. They also are becoming more bullish on the outlook for stock prices even as the market holds near record highs,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
""The Fed has put significant weight on consumer confidence in forming its views on the economy and, from that perspective, this report supports further rate increases.""
The U.S. central bank has raised rates twice this year. Economists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September and hike rates in December.
The Conference Board survey showed consumers mildly upbeat about their short-term income prospects. The percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in their income rose slightly to 20.9 percent this month from 20.0 percent in July. The share expecting a drop fell to 7.8 percent from 9.5 percent in July.
Despite being near full employment, the labor market has struggled to generate strong wage growth, a frustration for both consumers and policymakers.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of house prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in June on a year-over-year basis after a similar increase in May.
An acute shortage of homes on the market and strong demand are pushing up house prices. While rising house prices are boosting equity for homeowners, the dearth of properties is hurting home sales.

""Tight market conditions will drive house prices higher over the remainder of the year, although cautious appraisals and tougher mortgage lending regulations will act to prevent a dangerous house price boom,"" said Matthew Pointon, an economist at Capital Economics in New York.

Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in August, slowing from 2.9 percent in July and matching May's four-year low.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to annual growth of 2.5 percent.
Britain's housing sector has slowed sharply since the vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, when prices were growing by more than 5 percent a year.
""The moderation in price growth primarily reflects the squeeze on real wages and the slowdown in the pace that mortgage rates are falling,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Prices likely will continue to struggle to rise much, given that inflation still has further to rise, consumer confidence has deteriorated sharply since June and lenders intend to reduce the supply of unsecured credit.""
Nationwide said house prices slipped 0.1 percent in August compared with the previous month, after rising 0.2 percent in July.
Other house price surveys have painted a similar picture.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said British house prices rose at their slowest rate in over four years last month, while the number of sales slowed due to a limited supply of property and continued political uncertainty.

On Wednesday the Bank of England is due to publish mortgage lending data for July.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices in 2017 are likely to rise more than previously estimated despite a flurry of government curbs to crack down on speculation, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, soothing fears the economy would slow sharply. 
Property prices will continue to creep steadily higher amid heavy government intervention helped partly by a shift in demand to the country's smaller cities, according to the poll which surveyed 13 property analysts and economists from Aug. 21-28.
Average nationwide home prices were expected to rise a median 6.8 percent this year compared with a median expectation of 2 percent growth in the last poll in February.
Prices of new homes in China grew 12.4 percent in 2016, the fastest rate since 2011.
A resilient property market will be good news for China's policymakers, who want to keep the real estate market stable ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party congress. 
The authorities have defences already in place to guard against bubble risks in its hottest markets but the home-buying frenzy has reached the smaller cities, where local governments offer cheap credit and impose next to no restrictions.
The majority of the analysts surveyed are convinced current measures, first introduced in late 2016 and since fortified, will remain in place for the next one to two years. 
Most of them expect policymakers to roll out more long-term measures targeting structural imbalances, such as a property tax, pointing out that current administrative curbs are anti-market in nature and unsustainable.
""Usually tightening policies won't last for more than 3 years; it's impossible to always tighten and the effects wane as time goes by,"" researchers at the Bank of Communications said. 
""That's exactly why there's more urgency to establish a long-term mechanism to stabilize the housing market,"" they said in a research report.
But authorities have been walking a fine line between curbing excessive price gains and clamping down too hard on a sector which accounts for about 15 percent of the economy.
Beijing has tightened monetary conditions this year to tackle its growing debt pile as mortgages soar, but credit is still growing faster than economic output and most China watchers don't expect the central bank to tap too hard on the brakes. 
As deleveraging continues after the economy clocked 6.9 percent GDP growth for the first two quarters on a surging property market and an infrastructure binge, analysts expect slightly slower economic growth in the coming quarters.
""We think the biggest risk facing the housing market is that China's real economy may continue to slow, prompting the government to continue to oversupply credit, which would then flood the property market,"" wrote Sun Binyi, a researcher with China Real Estate Appraisal.

When asked to rate affordability of Chinese housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 7. That is in line with what analysts rated in the last poll, though some analysts have pointed out smaller cities are much more affordable than the biggest cities.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2017 08:15PM ET</span>",Japan July household spending unexpectedly falls despite tight job market,"By Leika Kihara and Sumio Ito
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending unexpectedly fell in July from a year earlier after last month's spike, casting some doubt on the sustainability of a domestic demand-driven economic recovery seen as vital to boosting tepid inflation.
The data keeps pressure on policymakers betting that a tightening labor market will boost wages and lift consumption, thereby allowing companies to raise prices and help the Bank of Japan achieve its ambitious 2 percent inflation goal.
Household spending slid 0.2 percent in July from a year earlier after hitting a two-year high in June, government data showed on Tuesday, confounding a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent increase.
The jobless rate was flat at 2.8 percent in July and 1.52 jobs were available per applicant, the highest since 1974, separate data showed, a sign the economy continued to enjoy what many analysts consider as near full employment.
""We are not too worried about the slowdown in household spending in July as strong job growth continues to support household incomes,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The upshot is that even though the tight labor market has yet to result in a marked pick-up in wage growth, strong job gains continue to support household incomes.""
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up.
But price and wage growth remain stubbornly weak with firms still wary of passing on profits to employees, raising doubts over whether the second-quarter's bounce can be sustained.
The uncertain outlook on consumption has not only discouraged many companies from raising prices but has also driven some to cut prices.
Retail giant Aeon (T:8267) said last week it will cut the prices of 114 food and grocery items at 2,800 outlets to attract consumers, and make up the cost by streamlining operations.

Core consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in July from a year earlier, marking a seventh straight gaining month but still quite a distance from the BOJ's 2 percent target.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>","Optimism wanes at UK services companies, labor shortages feared","LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism across Britain's services sector fell during the three months to August, and companies felt the pinch from rising costs even though new business largely held up, an industry survey showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly report on the services sector, which produces the vast bulk of economic output in Britain, showed confidence waned in both consumer- and business-facing services firms.
Official data last week showed Britain's economy suffered weakness on all fronts in the three months to June, with shoppers pinched by the pound's tumble, exports failing to fill the gap, and business investment frozen by Brexit uncertainty.
While the volume of activity at business and professional services firms improved to its highest since May 2016 during the three months to August, it cooled in consumer services firms.
The CBI's survey covered 167 services companies and was conducted between July 28 and Aug. 14. 
""It's fair to say that the performance of the UK services sector is very much a mixed bag this summer,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said. ""While business volumes and numbers employed have risen, the impact of higher costs is harming the profitability of firms.""
Costs per employee soared at the fastest rate since the start of the financial crisis at both professional and consumer services firms, the CBI said, despite few signs that staff are benefiting from higher wages.
British businesses have been strained by rising inflation since last year's vote to leave the European Union weakened the pound, pushing up the cost of imports. Exports have so far failed to fully compensate for this.
Four out of five companies in a separate British Chambers of Commerce survey published last Friday said their costs had increased this year because of changes to employment regulation, such as a higher minimum wage.
A record high proportion of consumer services companies cited a shortage of professional staff as a factor likely to limit growth in business over the next 12 months, the CBI said.
Many businesses are concerned that Britain's looming departure from the EU is reducing the supply of foreign workers. Figures last week showed net migration fell to its lowest level in three years during the 12 months to the end of March, and more than half the drop was due to EU nationals.
Manufacturing association EEF said a quarter of its employers were receiving fewer applications from EU nationals. 
A lack of British applicants meant almost two thirds of manufacturers needed to recruit staff from the EU, the EEF said in a survey it published on Tuesday, which was based on canvassing 243 companies in April.

""Preventing industry from being able to recruit the best skilled workers from the EU could stifle growth, damage British industry and the UK economy as a whole,"" said Tim Thomas, the EEF's director of employment and skills.

The Commerce Department said on Monday the goods trade gap increased 1.7 percent to $65.1 billion last month. Exports declined 1.3 percent, weighed down by an 8.0 percent tumble in shipments of motor vehicles.
There were also decreases in exports of consumer goods last month. Capital goods exports rose 1.5 percent.
""Early on in the third-quarter data cycle, we think trade will be a slightly positive factor for growth during the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""With the July data now in hand for capital goods shipments and related trade flows, we think real equipment spending will be strong in the third quarter.""
Imports fell 0.3 percent, reflecting a 2.8 percent drop in motor vehicle imports as well as a 1.7 percent decline in industrial supplies. Capital goods imports rose 2.0 percent last months and imports of consumer goods dipped 0.1 percent.
""The readings on consumer and capital goods imports are consistent with our view of ongoing expansion in U.S. economic activity, led by household and business spending,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital in New York.
The government will publish its comprehensive trade report, which includes services, next week. Trade added nearly two-tenths of a percentage point to the economy's 2.6 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department also reported on Monday that wholesale inventories increased 0.4 percent in July after rising 0.6 percent in June. However, retail inventories fell 0.2 percent after advancing 0.6 percent in June.
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also fell 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in June.

Despite July's soft inventory data, economists remained optimistic that inventory investment would contribute to growth in the third quarter. Inventory investment had a neutral impact on second-quarter GDP after slicing 1.46 percentage points from output in the first three months of the year.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to come in at 51.3 for August, down just a hair from July's 51.4, according to a median forecast of 39 economists polled by Reuters.
That would signal the 13th straight month of expansion for China's manufacturers, who are enjoying their best profits in years thanks to a government-led construction boom and a recovery in exports. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction a monthly basis.
Driven by strong infrastructure spending and record bank lending last year, China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017 and looks set to easily meet the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent.
That momentum has given policymakers room to focus on tackling financial risks stemming from a rapid build-up in debt and an overheated property market.
Economists expect such cooling measures will start to drag on growth eventually, but do not foresee any sharp slowdown, especially as the government is keen to ensure stability ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party leadership reshuffle in the autumn.
""Given that the economy is slowing from an elevated position, the central government's focus should change to stability concerns in place of a focus on economic growth,"" analysts at Sun Hung Kai Financial said in a note on Monday. 
Some signs of fatigue may already be starting to show.
China's import and export growth slowed more than expected in July, raising worries about domestic demand. Industrial output, investment, and retail sales also underwhelmed last month, while bank lending and money supply growth also slowed. 
Data on Sunday showed industrial profits grew at the slowest pace in three months as a boost from higher commodity prices starts to fade, but they were still up some 21 percent in the first seven months of the year from the same period last year.
Economists expect the findings of a private survey on China's factory activity will be similar to the official reading.
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will dip slightly to 50.9 in August from 51.1 in July, which would be the first decline in three months. 
The official PMI survey will be published on Aug. 31, along with a similar survey covering the services sector, while the Caixin PMI is set to be released on Sept. 1.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",India's GDP growth seen picking up to 6.6 percent but GST fogs outlook,"By Sujith Pai and Anu Bararia
BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's economic growth likely accelerated to 6.6 percent in the quarter just ended, but analysts polled by Reuters are sounding increasingly worried that confusion over a new goods and services tax will dampen activity in coming months.
The forecast, from a survey of over 40 economists taken over the past week, compares with growth of 6.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the slowest pace in two years. The range of forecasts was wide from 5.7 percent to 7.2 percent.
It would leave Asia's third-largest economy behind China, which last reported growth of 6.9 percent, but still among the world's top performing economies.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government surprised the country last November by scrapping high-value banknotes, wiping out about 86 percent of cash in circulation, which crimped consumer demand in a predominantly cash-reliant economy.
While the economy has clearly bounced back from the cash shock, forecasters in the latest Reuters poll said the pickup may be short-lived. The 6.6 percent growth forecast is down from 6.9 percent expected in a survey taken in July. [ECILT/IN]
Uncertainty over how smoothly the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be implemented remains large and tough to forecast. It was launched on July 1 to harmonize various value-added tax regimes across states in India to one national standard.
It has primarily hit micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses that were showing some signs of stabilization before demonetization and the launch of the GST, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Larson and Toubro Finance Holdings.
""This, combined with the ongoing stresses in large corporates, will certainly drag down gross domestic product growth,"" said Nitsure.
""Most of the policy moves or structural reforms introduced recently are more suited for normal or boom times rather than to the current phase of slowdown. Hence, they are accentuating the intensity of the downturn."" 
Confusion among businesses over how to price their goods and services is partly responsible for a contraction in both India's manufacturing and service sector activity in July. Industrial production  also fell.
Factory activity is forecast to have remained in a rut in August, though may show some signs of recovery. The August Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is forecast at 49.3 versus 47.9 in the previous month. Any number below 50 suggests contraction.
The forecasts were also in a wide range from 47.8 to 51.9.

The Reserve Bank of India earlier this month became the first major central bank in Asia to cut interest rates this year, using room provided by slumping inflation. But it kept the market guessing on whether there's more space for trimming.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2017 07:29AM ET</span>",China July industrial profits rise at slowest pace in three months,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Earnings growth for China's industrial firms cooled in July after accelerating for three straight months, reinforcing expectations the economy will slow over coming quarters as higher lending costs and property market curbs bite.
Profits earned by China's industrial companies in July rose 16.5 percent from a year earlier to 612.7 billion yuan ($92.18 billion), slower than the previous month, the statistics bureau said on Sunday.
That was the slowest rate of growth since profits rose 14.0 percent in April. 
Profit growth slowed in July because some companies halted production due to especially high temperatures, He Ping of the National Bureau of Statistics bureau said in a statement along with the data release. 
For the first seven months of the year, the firms notched up profits of 4.25 trillion yuan, a 21.2 percent jump from the same period last year and a touch slower than the 22.0 percent annual growth in the January-June period.
Earnings for the industrial sector were boosted by a year-long, government-led construction spree, which fueled demand and prices for building materials.
Government efforts to shut older, heavily polluting mines and factories have given commodity prices fresh impetus in recent weeks. 
Strong earnings, in turn, have opened the way for fresh investment, and given the country's long ailing ""smokestack"" industries more cash flow which could, in theory, be used to start paying down a mountain of debt. 
Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (Chalco) (SS:601600) (HK:2600) reported on Aug. 17 that its six-month net profit rose more than tenfold year-on-year as it cashed in sky-high aluminum prices. A day later, China's top state-run aluminum smelter said it will be making further investment in raising output in the second half of the year.
The manufacturing sector, which accounts for 88 percent of industrial profits, saw profit growth of 18.1 percent in the first seven months, trending down only slightly from 18.5 percent in the first half.
STALLING OUT
But analysts say economic growth is starting to slow as measures to cool heated property prices and clamp down on riskier forms of lending put the brakes on activity.
Beijing's efforts to reduce debt have pushed up lending rates, signaling tighter margins and tougher operating conditions for firms as debt servicing costs go up - a sign of slowing earnings growth over coming months.
In addition to slower profit growth, Sunday's data showed profit margins and account receivables days outstanding weakened slightly in July after improving for the last two months. Industrial firms' net profit margin fell to 6.09 percent in July from 6.11 in June. 
Weaker performance in the industrial sector is in line with July economic data that was mostly weaker than expected, after forecast-beating GDP growth of 6.9 percent in the first half.
At the end of July, industrial firms' liabilities were 6.6 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with a 6.4 percent increase at the end of June.
Profits at China's state-owned firms were up 44.2 percent at 927.4 billion yuan in January-July, compared with a 45.8 percent rise in the first six months. 

The data covers large companies with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

In a speech titled “Sustaining openness in a dynamic global economy”, Draghi said the global recovery is firming up, highlighting that growth has been “visible for some years”, particularly in the US, Europe, and Japan.
As was widely expected Draghi steered clear of talking about monetary policy but warned that protectionism poses a serious risk for continued productivity growth and potential growth in the global economy.
The speech came a few days after an earlier speech Wednesday, when Draghi avoided any mention of the ECB's plan to taper its ultra-loose monetary policy measures, leaving markets grasping at straws.

The Commerce Department said on Friday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent last month. They were up 3.3 percent from a year ago.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 1.0 percent after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in June. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They were previously reported to have gained 0.1 percent in June.
Businesses are boosting spending despite uncertainty over the prospect of tax cuts. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress have said they want to lower both corporate and individual taxes as part of a comprehensive tax restructuring, but few details have emerged.
With lawmakers soon to be preoccupied with legislation to raise the country's debt ceiling and keep the government funded beyond September, it is unclear how quickly the tax changes will be put on the legislative agenda.
Business spending on equipment added 0.44 percentage point to the economy's 2.6 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter, the most in nearly two years. It has been buoyed by the energy sector, where oil and gas drilling has rebounded after declining in the wake of the collapse in crude oil prices.
That is helping to offset some of the drag on manufacturing from declining motor vehicle production. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Last month, orders for machinery fell 1.4 percent, the biggest drop since May 2016, after rising 0.6 percent in June.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, tumbled 6.8 percent last month as bookings for transportation equipment plunged 19 percent. The drop in durable goods orders was the biggest since August 2014 and followed a 6.4 percent increase in June.
Boeing (N:BA) has reported on its website that it received only 22 aircraft orders in July, sharply down from 184 in the prior month.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 1.2 percent in July, the biggest drop since May 2016, after decreasing 0.7 percent in June. Auto sales peaked in December 2016 and slowing demand has led to three consecutive monthly declines in motor vehicle production.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Consumers were the main source of growth in Germany in the second quarter, data showed on Friday, as Europe's largest economy reaped the benefits of record-high employment, rising wages and low interest rates.
The German economy grew by 0.6 percent in April to June, the Federal Statistics Office said, lending support to Chancellor Angela Merkel's campaign for re-election, which revolves around a promise to create jobs and cut taxes.
Private consumption rose by 0.8 percent, contributing 0.4 percentage points to growth in gross domestic product (GDP). A labour market hungry for manpower has driven up wages, and low interest rates set by the European Central Bank are encouraging Germans to spend rather than save.
""Private consumption remains a reliable driver of growth,"" said Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP Bank. ""When there are no interest rates on one's account, spending becomes easy.""
Consequently, consumption has become the main engine for growth in Germany, replacing exports, which rose 0.7 percent on the quarter as imports increased by 1.7 percent. The imbalance meant trade subtracted 0.3 percentage points from growth.
""The negative impact of trade on growth should not be seen too negatively, as this is the result of dynamic imports and not a sign of weak exports,"" said Stefan Kipar, an economist at Bayern LP. ""The growth traffic light remains green.""
Besides private consumption, the economy also gained from state spending and investments in construction and equipment.
German manufacturers continue to hire and invest in equipment to meet rising orders, which in June rose twice as much as expected. Investment in machinery and equipment rose 1.2 percent, adding 0.1 percentage points to GDP growth.
Rising state spending, mainly on infrastructure and refugees, also contributed to growth by fuelling a boom in construction. Investment in construction jumped by 0.9 percent, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth.
Orders for construction companies rose by 5.5 percent in the first six months compared with the same period last year, the Statistics Office said, signalling that construction will remain strong in the coming months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in July from a year earlier to mark a seventh straight gaining month, a sign the economy is making slow but steady progress toward meeting the central bank's 2 percent inflation target.
But the increase was still largely driven by higher fuel bills as subdued wage growth discouraged consumers from increasing their spending, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in achieving its ambitious price goal.
The rise in the nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, matched a median market forecast and followed a 0.4 percent gain in June.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were up 0.4 percent in August from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent gain projected in a Reuters poll.
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up.
But price and wage growth remain stubbornly weak with firms still wary of passing more of their profits to employees, raising doubts over whether the second-quarter's bounce can be sustained.
The BOJ has had to push back the timing for reaching its price target six times since it deployed a massive stimulus program in 2013.

It now expects inflation to hit 2 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, arguing that a tightening job market and solid economic growth will gradually push up prices.

The monthly consumer confidence index from pollster YouGov and consultancy Cebr rose to 107.6 from 107.2 in July, aided by an increase in its measures of job security and house prices.
But consumers' perception of household finances worsened for a fifth month in a row, the longest run since YouGov records started eight years ago.
The Brexit vote in June 2016 led to a big fall in the value of sterling, which has pushed up inflation, gnawing at consumers' disposable income this year.
A national election this year in which Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away a parliamentary majority has added to a sense of uncertainty among the British public.
""Although this month's consumer confidence figures bring good news, they have to be placed in context – they have not yet returned to where they were ahead of the election,"" YouGov analyst Stephen Harmston said.
Other measures of consumer confidence have also fallen this year.
While the Bank of England expects trade and business investment to largely counter the slowdown in consumer confidence, neither of these things contributed to Britain's economic growth in the second quarter.

The Office National Statistics confirmed on Thursday the economy grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter after 0.2 percent in the first -- adding up to the slowest growth for any major advanced economy since the start of 2017.

Economic activity in June rose 0.3 percent compared with May, Indec said. The economy grew a cumulative 1.6 percent in the first half of the year, marking a continued recovery from a biting recession in the first half of 2016. The economy contracted by 2.2 percent overall last year. 
June marked the fourth straight month of year-on-year gains, providing a boost to President Mauricio Macri's market-friendly government ahead of October's mid-term vote, where a positive result could give political momentum to the rest of his agenda, including reforms to the country's tax code and capital markets. 
His ""Let's Change"" coalition performed better than market expectations in a primary vote on Aug. 13, virtually tying former populist President Cristina Fernandez in a Senate race for politically crucial Buenos Aires Province. More economic improvements in the coming months could give Macri's candidate the edge.
June's expansion was led by a recovering manufacturing sector, which grew 6.2 percent after snapping a streak of 15 consecutive months of contraction in May. Agriculture, spurred by record wheat and corn crops, grew 4 percent. 
Construction activity was up 13.2 percent compared with June of last year, driven by public infrastructure investment and growth in the real estate market as Macri's government expands mortgage credits.

Also on Thursday, Indec said Argentina posted a trade deficit of $798 million in July, the seventh straight month with a negative balance. Exports grew 5.2 percent compared with the same month last year to $5.2 billion, while imports grew 29.9 percent to $6 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly fell in July to an 11-month low as a chronic shortage of properties boosted prices, the latest sign that the housing market recovery was slowing. 
The cooling in housing activity reflects supply constraints rather than ebbing demand, which is being driven by a strong labor market. Other data on Thursday showed a slight increase in the number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week.
""Housing is far from being the economy's growth star,"" said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""It's not even a major supporting actor.""
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million units last month. That was the lowest level since August 2016. Sales rose 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Economists had forecast sales gaining 0.9 percent to a rate of 5.57 million units last month. The NAR report followed data on Wednesday showing a 9.4 percent drop in sales of new single-family homes in July and the second weekly fall in applications for home purchase loans.
Data this month also showed a dive in homebuilding and permits in July. Taken together, the reports suggest housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. Housing subtracted nearly three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the second quarter.
Despite the housing slowdown, economists expect the Federal Reserve to outline a plan to begin unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
Fed officials are focused on the labor market and inflation. With inflation continuing to undershoot its 2 percent target even as the labor market nears full employment, the U.S. central bank is, however, likely to hold off raising interest rates again until December.
The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
ACUTE HOUSING SHORTAGE
The PHLX index of housing stocks was little changed as were shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton. Shares of  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) fell 0.4 percent while those of Pultegroup advanced 0.4 percent. The overall U.S. stock market was trading lower.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries also fell. The dollar was slightly higher against a basket of currencies. 
The housing market has experienced an acute shortage of homes for sale for about two years. Builders have been unable to fill the inventory gap, citing a lack of land and skilled labor.
They have also complained of being constrained by expensive building materials. Last month, there were 1.92 million previously owned houses on the market, down 9.0 percent from a year ago.
Housing inventory has dropped for 26 straight months on a year-on-year basis. The median house price was $258,300 in July, a 6.2 percent rise from a year ago. That marked the 65th straight month of year-on-year price increases.
In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent, locking out many first-time homebuyers from the market. They accounted for a third of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market.
At July's sales pace, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.8 months one year ago. Economists view a six-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Sales fell in the Northeast and Midwest but rose in the West and South. Economists say builders have mostly focused on the high end of the market, but that may change if the strengthening labor market, as expected, keeps housing demand elevated. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Aug. 19.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market, for 129 consecutive weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 237,750 last week, the lowest level since May. 

Low numbers of layoffs have helped reduce the unemployment rate to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The unemployment rate has fallen five-tenths of a percentage point this year.

The ministry said the number of people registered as out of work in mainland France rose in July by 34,900 to 3,518,100, the highest level since August of last year.
The increase, one percent over one month and 0.1 percent over one year, was the biggest for one month since the jobless tally rose by nearly 44,000 in March.
Although business and consumer confidence is running at multi-year highs, the improvement has yet to translate into a sustained drop in the jobless total.
President Emmanuel Macron, who took office in May, is counting on bringing the numbers down by easing labor regulations in a reform to be presented next week.
Even though jobless numbers have remained stubbornly high despite a stronger economy, new job creation has been picking up, helping to bring down the unemployment rate.

It fell in the second quarter to a five-year low of 9.5 percent from 9.6 percent in the previous three months, the INSEE statistics agency said earlier this month.

Supply was down 9.0 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has declined for 26 consecutive months on a year-on-year basis.
A dearth of properties on the market has crimped the housing recovery and forced price appreciation to significantly outstrip wage gains.
The median house price was $258,300, a 6.2 percent rise from one year ago, reflecting the paucity of properties.
""Demand remains strong but inventory shortage is the choke point,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) fell after the data, underperforming the broader stock market.
At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.8 months one year ago. Economists view a 6-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The median number of days homes were on the market in July was 30, compared to 36 days one year ago.
Across the regions, the Northeast saw a decline of 14.5 percent and in the Midwest sales were down 5.3 percent. They jumped in the West by 5.0 percent while sales increased 2.2 percent in the South.

The industry data showed that home resales unexpectedly decreased by 1.3% in July to a seasonally adjusted 5.44 million units from 5.51 million units in the previous month. June’s data was revised down from an initial reading of 5.52 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.9% increase June’s initial reading to 5.57 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
The report indicated that the drop was due to large declines in the Northeast and Midwest that outweighed sales increases in the South and West.
The data also showed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in July was $258,300, up 6.2% from July 2016 ($243,200), the 65th straight month of year-over-year gains.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that the second half of the year got off on a “somewhat sour note”.
“Buyer interest in most of the country has held up strongly this summer and homes are selling fast, but the negative effect of not enough inventory to choose from and its pressure on overall affordability put the brakes on what should’ve been a higher sales pace,” he explained.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>","UK shop sales slide unexpectedly in August, retailers' mood downbeat: CBI","LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - British retail sales growth slowed in August at the fastest pace in more than a year as the squeeze on consumers from rising prices continued, according to a survey on Thursday.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly retail sales balance slid to -10 in August from +22 last month, its lowest since July 2016 - just after Britons voted to leave the European Union.
The reading was far below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, all of whom expected only a modest slowdown in growth.
While retailers expected sales to pick up again next month, they were downbeat about the current business situation.
Quarterly figures from the CBI showed retailers reduced staff at the fastest pace since 2009 and they did not expect an improvement soon.
""Despite the warmer weather at the start of the month, retail sales have cooled as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers' pockets,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
The Brexit vote in June 2016 led to a big fall in the value of sterling, which has pushed up inflation, gnawing at consumers' disposable income this year.
Official data earlier on Thursday showed British household spending grew at its weakest pace since late 2014 during the second quarter, underlining the strain on households and retailers.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Weak pound pushes UK household spending growth to slowest since 2014,"LONDON - British household spending grew at its weakest pace since late 2014 in the three months to June as the effect of a weaker pound since last year's Brexit vote weighed on Britons' spending power, official statistics showed on Thursday.
Year-on-year spending growth dropped to 2.0 percent from 2.6 percent after expanding just 0.1 percent in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.
Overall growth in gross domestic product was unrevised from an earlier estimate at 0.3 percent on a quarterly basis and 1.7 percent annually, the ONS added - representing the weakest start to any year since 2012.
""GDP growth has slowed markedly in the first half of the year,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said. ""Household spending grew weakly, with the lower-value pound hitting household budgets,"" he added.
Sterling has fallen by around 15 percent on a trade-weighted since June 2016's vote to leave the European Union, pushing consumer price inflation to its highest in nearly four years in May, and added to its losses after the latest data. 
Thursday's figures also showed that year-on-year business investment growth slowed to zero from 0.7 percent in the first quarter, while net trade dragged down the annual growth rate by 0.5 percent.
Britain's economy grew 1.8 percent last year, one of the fastest rates among the world's seven largest advanced economies, capped by growth of 0.7 percent in the last three months of the year.
But that growth relied heavily on robust consumer spending, which this year has come under increased pressure from rising inflation as stores push up prices in response to sterling's sharp fall after the Brexit vote.
The Bank of England said earlier this month that it expected the economy to grow 1.6 percent this year - slower than it had previously forecast but in line with the average expectation of economists polled by Reuters.
While it expects growth in household consumption to slow to 1.75 percent this year as inflation approaches 3 percent, it forecast export volumes would rise by 3.5 percent and business investment would rise by 1 percent.
Few economists expect the BoE to raise interest rates before 2019 as inflation is forecast to fall next year once the impact of sterling's weakness fades, while uncertainty during two years of Brexit talks is predicted to drag on growth.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A smaller-than-expected rise in Brazil's consumer prices in mid-August pushed inflation to a new 18-year low, keeping the central bank on track to cut interest rates aggressively.
The IPCA-15 consumer price index  rose 2.68 percent in the 12 months through mid-August, below the 2.73 percent expected in a Reuters poll and down from 2.78 percent in mid-July, statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday.
The reading is far below the bottom end of the central bank's annual target range of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, supporting bets of a sharp rate cut at the central bank's September meeting.
Food and beverage prices slipped 0.7 percent, extending a string of drops driven by a strong agricultural harvest and leading economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to cut their estimates for year-end inflation to 3.5 percent from 3.9 percent.
But disinflation was widespread, thanks to a slower-than-expected economic recovery and double-digit unemployment. So-called core inflation, which strips the price index of volatile food prices, came in below the bottom-end of the target range at 3.4 percent.
UBS economists revised their forecast and now expect the central bank in September to reduce rates by 100 basis points from 75 basis points previously, aligning with the growing market consensus. It would be the fourth 100-basis point cut that the bank has made.
Yields paid on interest-rate futures <0#2DIJ:> fell.
""Inflation will allow the BCB to keep the current Selic easing pace,"" they wrote in a report.
Slowing inflation in Brazil parallels weakening price pressures in developed economies, where tepid global economic growth has kept central banks on edge.
Brazilian consumer prices gained 0.35 percent in the month to mid-August due to a one-off increase in fuel taxes, as well as a regulatory decision to raise power rates as scarcer rains sapped hydroelectric generation. Economists expected a 0.40 percent monthly increase.
Below is the result for each price category:

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in July, dropping to their lowest in seven months amid a surge in prices, raising concerns of a slowdown in the housing market recovery.
Coming on the heels of data this month showing a tumble in home building and permits in July, the weak sales pace suggests that housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
""The third-quarter sales data are starting out significantly below the second-quarter average, and many other housing reports have also shown some recent weakening in their respective trends,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Today's report strengthens our conviction that real residential investment will decline in the third quarter.""
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales declined 9.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571,000 units last month, the lowest level since December 2016. The percentage drop was the largest since August 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent gain.
June's sales pace was revised up to 630,000 units from the previously reported 610,000 units. Home sales in May also were not as weak as previously reported, taking some of the sting from July's report.
New home sales, which account for 9.4 percent of overall housing sales, are volatile month-to-month and are drawn from building permits. Still, sales declined 8.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, the first annual drop since February 2016.
July's sales pace was below the second-quarter average of 613,000 units. Sales fell in the Northeast, South and West, but rose in the Midwest. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy a house decreased last week to a six-month low.
A survey last month by Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. mortgage guarantor, showed a drop in the share of respondents saying now is a good time to buy a home as well as a surge in the number of those who believe this is a bad time to buy.
Housing subtracted nearly three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the second quarter.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors worried over comments by President Donald Trump threatening a government shutdown to secure funding for a border wall with Mexico, raising the specter of a tough budget battle.
Trump also said late on Tuesday he might terminate the NAFTA trade treaty with Mexico and Canada after three-way talks failed to bridge deep differences.
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) fell in line with a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), slipped 0.22 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) fell 0.28 percent.
Pultegroup (N:PHM) stock declined 0.43 percent. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
Despite the drop in new home sales, the housing market remains underpinned by a strong labor market, which is near full employment. But it is being hampered by a shortage of homes, which is driving up prices.
Contributing to the dearth of homes on the market, some homeowners are remodeling their houses rather than trading up.
Those renovations are boosting business for home improvement retailers like Lowe's Companies (N:LOW), which on Wednesday reported a 6.8 percent increase in net sales in the quarter ended Aug. 4.
The median price of a new home increased 6.3 percent in July from a year ago to $313,700. In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent.
Despite the acute housing shortage, builders are struggling to fill the void, citing supply constraints, including labor, land and finance. Last month, 70 percent of the new single family homes sold were either yet to be built or under construction in July.
""New home sales are still concentrated in the higher end of the market,"" said Matthew Pointon, an economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""Until builders switch their efforts to cheaper starter homes that will limit to degree to which sales can grow.""
The inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.5 percent to 276,000 units last month, the highest level since June 2009. Still, new housing stock is less than half of what it was at its zenith during the housing bubble.
At July's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the

supply of houses on the market, almost a two-year high and up from 5.2 months in June.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 56.9 in August, from the prior month’s reading of 54.7. That was a 28-month high.
Analysts had expected the reading to inch up to only 54.9.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
On the downside, IHS Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.5 in August from the prior month’s final reading of 53.3.
That was a two-month low and came out under forecasts for the reading to remain unchanged.
Meanwhile, the composite PMI, including activity in both sectors, rose to 56.0 in August from the previous month’s reading of 54.6. That was the fastest growth in overall activity since May 2015.
The report indicated that private sector companies signaled a “sharp and accelerated increase in business activity during August.”
IHS Markit director Rob Dobson qualified the preliminary survey as a “tale of two sectors”, noting the sluggish performance in the manufacturing sector as production volumes rose at the weakest pace in over a year.
“Nonetheless, the acceleration signaled for the economy as a whole suggests that GDP growth is still gaining momentum during the third quarter,” he concluded.

(Reuters) - Euro zone business growth maintained a solid clip in August, driven by the best manufacturing performance in 6-1/2 years despite a strong euro, easily offsetting a mild slowdown in services growth, a key private sector survey showed on Wednesday. 
Taken together with a mild pickup in price pressures, the data is likely to support expectations that the European Central Bank will proceed later this year with making plans to scale back its multi-billion euro monthly asset purchases.
The Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), generally considered a good indicator of overall economic growth, edged up slightly to 55.8 in August from 55.7, beating the median Reuters Poll estimate of 55.5.
The momentum was underpinned by strong manufacturing growth in both of the euro zone's biggest economies, Germany and France, where manufacturing PMIs surged above even the most optimistic forecasts.
Overall, the latest data suggest 0.5 percent economic growth in the 19-member single currency bloc during July-September, the survey's compilers said, compared with 0.6 percent in the previous quarter.
That was a slight downgrade from their assessment in July, but higher than the current 0.4 percent consensus among economists from the latest Reuters poll.
""These numbers will not change the ECB's fundamental assessments of the economy,"" noted Holger Sandte, chief European analyst at Nordea Markets. ""The recovery is robust – good but old news. At the same time, core inflation is low and will most likely continue to pick up only very gradually.""
The euro bounced off session lows after the Germany PMI data were released, half an hour before the euro zone data, but later gave up its gains in very thin trading.
What may be particularly encouraging to the ECB is the fact a 12 percent rise in the euro so far this year does not appear to have dented manufacturing. The PMIs also showed the strongest new export orders performance since February 2011. 
But services activity dipped to the weakest since the start of the year, along with a slowdown in orders growth.
Business expectations across all industries slipped to their weakest since November. But apart from coming off a recent high in May, there was no reason given by the survey's compilers for why sentiment had declined.
Price pressures, while subdued, accelerated slightly to the highest since May. Hiring growth slowed slightly in services and manufacturing, but remained solid.
The reaction from analysts was broadly positive. 
""Even though service sector growth has been somewhat weaker recently, the fundamentals for continued strength in the second half of 2017 are still there,"" said Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING. However, he played down the slight inflation pressure.

""As businesses indicated faster increases in selling prices earlier in the year, this will not convince the ECB that faster price growth is imminent ahead of (ECB President Mario) Draghi’s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. In fact, we think that improvements in inflation to above 1.5 percent are unlikely for the coming months, so look for a cautious Draghi at the end of the week.""

The preliminary reading of the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to a two-month high of 57.4 this month up from 56.6 in July. Economists had expected a reading of 56.3.
The manufacturing sector was boosted with output and new orders rising at sharper rates in August. The latter was boosted by the fastest rise in exports for six-and-a-half years.
The services PMI eased to a seven month low of 54.9, compared to expectations for 55.4, down from 55.4 a month earlier.
Despite the slowdown, the rate of expansion remained solid amid a further increase in new orders.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose to a two month high of 55.8 from 55.7 in July, compared to expectations for 55.5.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The latest PMI readings for the eurozone signal a continuation of the recent strong performance of the currency bloc’s economy. This stabilisation in the rate of expansion is pleasing, following signs of growth easing in recent months,"" said Andrew Harker, associate director at survey compiler Markit.

The world's second-largest economy imported and exported goods worth $456 million in July, down from $489 million in June, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs.
It was up from $426 million in July last year, according to data on the customs website.
Year-to-date, trade was up 10.2 percent at $3.01 billion.
The data indicates that China's move to halt North Korean coal imports in February has crimped Pyongyang's ability to raise hard currency through exports. 
Iron ore arrivals from North Korea in July also sank to their weakest since February, while China's gasoline exports to the isolated state hit their lowest since January 2016.
China's imports from North Korea were $156 million, down 3 percent from last month and a third lower than a year ago, based on data on the customs website. For January-July, imports were $1.04 billion, down 16.3 percent.
Exports were $300 million, down from $327 million in June, but up from $194 million in July last year. Year-to-date, they were up a third at $1.97 billion.
On Aug. 6, the United Nations Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea banning exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood, in a bid to choke off a third of Pyongyang's $3 billion in annual export revenue.
The crackdown on major commodity exports was aimed as punishment for intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in July and is due to take effect in early September.
Last week, Beijing issued an official ban on the imports effective from Aug. 15 as it moved to implement the sanctions.
Sources told Reuters China was also pressuring its iron ore traders to stop buying the commodity from North Korea, tightening the screws on Pyongyang even before sanctions. 
The data also comes after state-owned China National Petroleum Corp suspended sales of fuel to North Korea in June over concerns it wouldn't get paid, cutting off crucial supplies. The suspension is still in place. 
These kinds of actions have been at the center of U.S. President Donald Trump's calls for Beijing to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. 
On Tuesday, the United States imposed new sanctions, targeting Chinese and Russian firms and individuals for supporting Pyongyang's weapons programs.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 55.7 from its 10-month-low of 54.7 in the previous month.
This beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, who had expected a stable reading. It was also well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The stronger-than-expected headline figure showed that underlying growth remains strong, IHS Markit Associate Director Andrew Harker said, adding that he expected a quarterly growth rate of roughly 0.5 percent for the July-September period.
The German economy expanded by 0.7 percent in the first quarter and by 0.6 percent in the second, driven by soaring private consumption, increased state spending and higher industrial output.
Harker said Markit was likely to raise its growth forecast for 2017 from its latest projection of 2.0 percent. The German economy grew by 1.9 percent last year.
Growth in manufacturing accelerated to 59.4 in August, the third-highest reading in more than six years, the survey showed. Analysts had expected the sector to lose some steam.
Services business activity also increased, with Markit's sub-index for the sector rising to 53.4. This was slightly better than analysts had predicted.
New export orders at goods-producing companies jumped by the sharpest rate in more than seven years, with survey panellists pointing to especially strong demand from Asia, Markit said.
""The recent appreciation of the euro doesn't seem to have an impact on German exports,"" Harker said, adding that this also applied to the emissions scandal engulfing German car makers.
Another survey published by the ZEW research institute on Tuesday showed that the mood among German investors fell for the third month running, amid concern that the emissions scandal could damage the economy in the medium term.

The sentiment surveys from ZEW and Markit will be followed by the closely watched Ifo business climate index on Friday. Analysts expect the indicator to fall after it reached successive record highs from May to July.

The overall rate of expansion picked up from July’s ten-month low, a trend reflected in both manufacturing output and services business activity.
The preliminary German manufacturing purchasing managers’ index climbed to 59.4 this month from a final reading of 58.1 in July. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 57.7 in August.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index improved to 53.4 this month from 53.1 in July, above expectations for a reading of 53.3.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Commenting on the report, Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at Markit, said, “Overall, the PMI data for the third quarter so far and the upward revisions to official data suggest that IHS Markit’s current growth forecast for 2017–at 2.0%–is likely to be raised.""
EUR/USD was at 1.1769 from around 1.1749 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.9180 from 0.9165 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were mostly higher after the open. Germany's DAX rose 0.3%, the EURO STOXX 50 added 0.3%, France’s CAC 40 inched up 0.3%, while London’s FTSE 100 declined 0.1%.

The preliminary reading of the Markit services purchasing managers’ index dipped to 55.5 this month from 56.0 in July. Economists had forecast a slight decrease to 55.8.
The manufacturing PMI rose to 56.2, compared to expectations for 54.5 and from 54.9 a month earlier.
While growth in service sector activity was softer for the third consecutive month the rate of expansion in manufacturing production was the sharpest in almost six-and-a-half years.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors came in at 55.6 this month, unchanged from July beating expectations for 55.5.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
""The latest data paint another positive picture of the French private sector economy, with further strong expansions in both new business and output. The data are particularly promising for the manufacturing sector, with output and new order growth at multi-year highs,"" said Alex Gill, economist at survey compiler Markit.
“Another sharp rise in private sector employment continued to be a key takeaway from the latest survey. Indeed, with capacity pressures intensifying, signs are that unemployment will continue to decline in the third quarter.”

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said 29 percent of firms surveyed reported higher confidence in hiring and investment, but 20 percent were less confident than before. The positive margin was the narrowest since the REC started the survey in its current form in June 2016.
Employers' confidence about the economy in general was the lowest since November.
""This drop in employer confidence should raise a red flag,"" REC chief executive Kevin Green said.
""Businesses are continuing to hire to meet demand, but issues like access to labor, Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty are creating nervousness,"" he added.
The REC data is based on a survey of 601 employers conducted between April 26 and July 10 by polling company ComRes. REC said the loss of confidence had intensified toward the end of the period.
It is unclear how much Britain's government will curb immigration by EU workers after the country leaves the bloc in March 2019.
Prime Minister Theresa May has stuck with a long-standing, unfulfilled pledge to cut total net immigration to less than 100,000 a year. But finance minister Philip Hammond has said he wants to avoid any 'cliff-edge' change in 2019.
Official statistics last week showed that year-on-year growth in the number of non-British EU-born workers fell to a seven-year low in the three months to June.
The REC said staff shortages were most acute in the construction and health and social care sectors, both of which rely heavily on foreign staff.
Overall, 40 percent of employers said they had ""absolutely no"" spare capacity, up from 35 percent a year earlier.

Gross domestic product grew 0.6 percent in the April-June period from the previous three months, according to the INEGI national statistics agency. That compared with growth of 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
Mexico's economy has been more resilient this year than expected, as fears that U.S. President Donald Trump could follow through on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made exports have not materialized.
""Expectations for year-end have improved, a reflection of the favorable performance of the domestic market, the reactivation of external demand and greater confidence in the strength of the relationship with our main trading partner,"" Mexico's Finance Ministry said in a statement.
Uncertainty surrounding the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which underpins some $1 trillion in trilateral trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada, has also fueled concerns about growth in Latin America's second-largest economy.
Negotiators from the three countries wrapped up their first round of talks on Sunday to revamp the trade pact, vowing to keep up a pace of negotiations that some involved in the process say may be too fast to bridge deep differences.
The Finance Ministry added that it will update its current estimate of 2017 GDP growth of between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent when it presents its 2018 fiscal budget proposal to Congress. It has until Sept. 8 to do so.
In annual terms, GDP expanded 1.8 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. 
The growth figures matched forecasts in a Reuters poll as well as the government's preliminary estimates published on July 31.
""Going forward, we expect growth to moderate and the engines of growth to rebalance, with higher contributions from manufacturing and net exports and less thrust from services and private and public consumption,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a note to clients.

Ramos added that uncertainty surrounding the NAFTA renegotiation and Mexico's 2018 presidential election will likely continue to be a drag on activity.

Tourism Minister Salma Loumi said 4.58 million foreign tourists visited the North African country between Jan. 1 and Aug. 10. Arrivals from neighboring Algeria were up 60 percent, helped by a promotional campaign by Tunisia, while visits by European tourists rose 16 percent.
""There are good indicators, revenues rose by 19 percent to 1.5 billion Tunisian dinars ($613 million)"", Loumi told reporters on Tuesday.
Tunisian officials expect the number of foreign tourists to rise to 6.5 million this year, up about 30 percent from 2016, due to an improving security situation and interest from new markets including Russia.
That would mark a return to normal, although below a record 6.9 million visitors seen in 2010.
Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of Tunisia's gross domestic product, provides thousands of jobs and is a key source of foreign currency, but it has struggled since two major attacks in 2015.
The first at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis left 21 tourists dead, while 39 mostly British holidaymakers were killed in the second attack on a beach in the resort city of Sousse.
 Last month, however, Britain's foreign office said it was no longer advising against travel to most of the North African country including the capital Tunis and major tourist destinations.
Tour operator Thomas Cook has said it will resume offering holidays in Tunisia following the change.
Tunisia's tourism ministry said it expected the company to start offering flights to Tunisia from February 2018.
The government expects rising tourism to help Tunisia's economy grow 2.5 percent this year, after a 1 percent expansion last year.

The Confederation of British Industry said its monthly industrial order book balance rose to +13 this month from +10 in July, beating economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for it to edge slightly lower and well above its long-run average.
Expectations for the volume of output over the next three months were the highest since March - showing manufacturers expect similar growth to the previous three months - while pricing expectations firmed after a dip in July.
""There are further signs that exporters are feeling the benefit from the lower pound in this month's figures, and output growth is expected to power on over the coming quarter,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Inflation was likely to rise to around 3 percent later this year and fall little next year, she added, as manufacturers continued to pass on the effect of sterling's fall after the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union.
The upbeat message from the CBI on growth echoes that found in other business surveys, but contrasts with official data, which showed manufacturing output contracted by 0.6 percent in the three months to June, reflecting weaker car production.
The CBI survey was based on responses from 432 manufacturers collected between July 26 and Aug. 11.

A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions ticked up to 86.7 points from 86.4 in July, compared to forecasts for 85.5.
“The significant decrease of the ZEW economic sentiment indicator reflects the high degree of nervousness over the future path of growth in Germany,"" said ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach.

The median estimate in the survey of 11 economists was for industrial output to rise 14 percent from a year earlier.
That would be the biggest increase since December, when manufacturing output expanded 22.4 percent from a year earlier.
""We are likely to get blockbuster year-on-year figures because of a low base last year,"" said OCBC economist Selena Ling.
In June, manufacturing output exceeded market expectations, expanding 13.1 percent, helped by strong electronics and pharmaceutical output.
""The trend in manufacturing has remained strong throughout 2017 because of improvements in global demand,"" Moody's said in a research note on Aug. 15, adding that electronics manufacturers have been ""the primary beneficiary"".
In the poll, industrial production is seen contracting 3.4 percent in July on a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, after rising 9.7 percent in June.
Ling of OCBC said the month-on-month contraction would be no surprise after exceptional strong on-month growth in June.
Singapore and other trade-reliant Asian economies have received a major boost this year from resurgent in global demand. That has led to a solid increase in the city-state's production of electronics products, including semiconductors.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadians took on more consumer debt in the second quarter and average mortgage loan balances also increased, but delinquency rates fell, a major credit report provider said on Tuesday.
Years of ultra-low interest rates since the financial crisis spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years, fueling a housing boom that has recently began to falter.
Non-mortgage debt balances averaged C$22,154 ($17,612) in the quarter, up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, TransUnion's report showed. However, serious delinquency rates, which incorporate repayments more than two months overdue, fell by 8 basis points to 2.65 percent.
Average mortgage loan balances rose by 4.8 percent in the last year to C$198,781 at in the middle of 2017, TransUnion said, reflecting rising house prices. Serious delinquency rates for mortgages fell by 4 basis points to 0.56 percent, the third consecutive quarter of declining delinquency.
TransUnion Canada's Director of Research and Analysis Matt Fabian said home values had continued to rise compared to the previous year, pushing overall mortgage debt levels up, but there was an easing of that trend in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter.
Fabian said serious delinquency rates had remained low with consumers able to manage their repayments despite the increasing balance levels.
""We will continue to monitor these trends especially as interest rates rise, though we don't anticipate a material impact on mortgages in the near term,"" he said.
The Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years on Wednesday, raising concerns that highly-indebted consumers could struggle with making increased repayments.
The report showed rising delinquencies in two categories, credit cards and auto loans, which economists say are often the first to show evidence that consumers are struggling to keep their finances under control.
Serious credit card delinquencies rose by 5 basis points to 3.11 percent and auto loan delinquencies increased by 9 basis points to 1.8 percent.

The first-of-its-kind New York Fed study, to be published three times per year, paints a gloomy picture of U.S. workers' aspirations. Even though the unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent, is near a 16-year low after more than eight years of economic recovery, national measures of wages have shown only modest growth.
Survey respondents on average said in July that the lowest annual salary they would accept in a new job would be $57,960, down from $59,660 only four months earlier. This measure has declined since November, with most of the changes coming from older and higher-income Americans.
Asked what salary they expected in job offers over the next four months, the average response declined to $50,790 from $54,590 when the last survey was taken in March.
The survey, conducted since early 2014 but published for the first time on Monday, also showed 22.7 percent of respondents searched for a job in the last four weeks, up from 19.4 percent in the previous report. Young people accounted for most of the increase. 

The respondents saw a 22 percent likelihood of receiving at least one job offer in the next four months, down from an average response of 25 percent eight months ago.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers rose in August to its highest level in a decade led by producers of industrial materials, a Reuters poll showed, in a further sign of broadening economic recovery. The Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - found the service-sector mood fell but still remained at a relatively high level, underscoring the firmness in domestic demand which drove robust expansion in the second quarter.
Business sentiment was likely to sag slightly over the next three months, indicating a potential pullback from the hefty 4 percent annualized growth in the April-June quarter driven by private consumption and capital expenditure.
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose one point to 27 in August in the poll of 548 large- and mid-sized companies, conducted Aug. 1-16, in which 265 firms responded.
It was the best reading since August 2007, just before the last global financial crisis, led by producers of industrial materials such as oil, steel and chemicals, as well as manufacturers of metals, machinery and transport equipment. 
""Our business is led by overseas markets. The domestic market is not so bad, China is recovering and America and Europe are performing well. Overall the sentiment is positive,"" Keisuke Fujii, a spokesman for Fanuc Corp (T:6954), a manufacturer of robotics and automation equipment, told Reuters.
The company expects current profits to rise 6.1 percent this financial year and sales to increase 13.9 percent, due to demand for IT-related products in China and Taiwan, and industrial robots in the United States, Europe and China, he said.
BAD WEATHER, WARINESS ON OUTLOOK
Reflecting some wariness on the outlook, however, the manufacturers' index was seen slipping to 26 in November, with the yen strengthening amid concerns over developments surrounding North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.
""Given the ongoing strength of overseas demand, we believe sentiment will remain firm going forward,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""That said, the Japanese yen is appreciating and share prices are falling amid geopolitical risk. This trend, if it accelerates, could sharply undermine business sentiment."" 
The Reuters Tankan service-sector index slipped to 29 in August from the previous month's two-year high of 33, dragged down by sectors such as retailing, where confidence fell for a third straight month.
The service-sector index was expected to drop further to 25 in November.
Cool and rainy weather may dampen consumer spending in August, which would be worrying as private consumption constitutes about 60 percent of the economy and was a primary driver of the second-quarter's robust expansion.
Still, the retailers' sentiment index is expected to bounce in November, underlining a pick-up in consumption with a change in the weather, and the tightening labor market keeping household incomes firm. 
The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The BOJ's last tankan out July 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Contracts awarded to build economic projects in the Gulf's rich Arab oil exporting states slumped in the first half of this year but are expected to pick up in the second half, a data service tracking the industry said on Saturday.
Awards in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council dropped to $56.1 billion in the January-June period from $69.3 billion a year earlier, according to MEED Projects. Low oil prices have forced governments in the region into tough austerity policies.
With the exception of Saudi Arabia, where contract awards rose 12 percent from a year ago to $15.8 billion as the government showed signs of spending a little more freely with a modest improvement in its budget position, awards fell in every GCC state.
Kuwait saw a 46 percent drop to $6.9 billion and awards in Bahrain plunged 84 percent to $917 million. Even Dubai experienced a slight fall, MEED said; awards in the United Arab Emirates dropped 13 percent to $21.3 billion.
However, MEED forecast $61 billion of project awards in the GCC during the second half of this year, bringing the total for 2017 to about $117 billion, roughly the same as in 2016.
""There’s no doubt that the past two years have been tough for the projects supply chain as government spending has slowed,"" said Ed James, director of content and analysis at MEED Projects.
""But with construction companies now more efficient, the private sector more active and the number of public-private partnership projects growing by the week, there is cause for optimism.""
This year's total is expected to be boosted by Oman, where the venture planning a 230,000 barrel of oil per day refinery at Duqm said in early August that it was likely to award over $5 billion of engineering, procurement and construction contracts to Petrofac (L:PFC), Samsung (KS:005930) Engineering (KS:028050), Technicas Reunidas (MC:TRE), Daewoo Engineering and Construction (SE:047040) and  Saipem  (MI:SPMI).
In Saudi Arabia, sources told Reuters this week that the government was preparing to restart work on projects that are important to its drive to boost Islamic tourism, including expansion of the Grand Mosque in Mecca and a $3.5 billion hotel complex in that city.
James said there were over $2 trillion of known, active projects in the pipeline across the GCC.
""The majority of these are infrastructure schemes that are essential to the future prosperity of the region, job creation and economic diversification,"" he said.
""While inevitably not all will come to fruition, we can be confident that there is still a large amount of work to come regardless of the oil price.""

The regional central bank's ""Nowcast"" model calculated the economy was expanding at an annualized pace of 2.09 percent in the third quarter, faster than the 1.96 percent rate a week earlier.
""Positive surprises from retail sales, survey, and industrial production data outweighed negative surprises from housing data,"" the New York Fed said.
On Thursday, the Federal Reserve said manufacturing output dipped 0.1 percent in July due mainly to a 3.6 percent drop production of motor vehicles and parts.
On Tuesday, domestic retail sales climbed 0.6 percent last month for their largest increase since December 2016. June's retail sales were revised to show a 0.3 percent gain rather than an earlier reported 0.2 percent fall.

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 97.6 in the first half of August from 93.4 the month before, which was an eight-month low. The result exceeded expectations for a reading of 94, according to a Reuters poll.
Whether that optimism holds in the weeks ahead, however, is a major question following recent events stemming from a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. There were not enough survey interviews conducted following the protests, in which one woman died as white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters, to assess how much the events might weaken sentiment. 
Curtin said the backlash over Charlottesville and U.S. President Donald Trump's response could weigh on subsequent survey readings.
Trump has blamed the Charlottesville violence on not just the white nationalist rally organizers but also the counter-protesters, and said there were ""very fine people"" among both groups. His remarks drew rebukes from Republican and Democrat lawmakers as well as business leaders and U.S. allies.
""The fallout is likely to reverse the improvement in economic expectations recorded across all political affiliations in early August,"" Curtin said. ""Moreover, the Charlottesville aftermath is more likely to weaken the economic expectations of Republicans, since prospects for Trump's economic policy agenda have diminished.""
FALLOUT FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE 
The private sector has reacted to Trump's remarks as well. Earlier this week, several chief executives quit Trump's two business advisory groups in protest, resulting in the president disbanding the groups altogether.
Moreover, speculation emerged that key officials, notably director of National Economic Council Gary Cohn, could resign due to Trump's controversial comments.
Cohn is seen leading the White House's effort on tax reform and is a front-runner to possibly succeed Janet Yellen as head of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
On Thursday, rumors on social media of Cohn resigning spurred a sell-off on Wall Street and buying of U.S. Treasury bonds -- a safe-haven market instrument in times of uncertainty -- as traders feared Trump's economic agenda would stall. 
CURRENT, FUTURE DIVERGE
The rebound in University of Michigan's overall consumer reading in early August was due to a jump in the survey's expectations component. It rose to 89.0 from 80.5 in July.
On the other hand, the survey's current conditions measure fell to 111.0 from 113.4 in late July. 
""I would say that the economy is in good shape and is not especially sensitive to the latest political buzz, but how much of a hit confidence takes remains to be seen,"" Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpoint Securities' chief economist, wrote in a research note.

The preliminary publication of the data for August from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment advanced to 97.6 from 93.4 in the previous month.
That was its highest reading since January and analysts had forecast the reading to rise to just 94.0.
The current conditions indicator dropped to 111.0 in August, from the previous 113.4.
Consensus was looking for the reading to slip to 113.3 from July’s level.
Additionally, consumer expectations increased to 89.0 in August, from the prior reading of 80.5.
Economists had expected the indicator to inch up to 81.0.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months held steady at 2.6%, while the five-year gauge decreased to 2.5%, from the prior 2.6%.
“Consumer confidence rose in the first half of August to its highest level since January due to a more positive outlook for the overall economy as well as more favorable personal financial prospects,” the report indicated.
Chief economist Richard Curtin noted that index components had nearly regained 2017 peaks, but he remained cautious.
“Too few interviews were conducted following Charlottesville to assess how much it will weaken consumers' economic assessments,” he explained.
“The fallout is likely to reverse the improvement in economic expectations recorded across all political affiliations in early August,” Curtin predicted.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices were expected to show their seventh straight month of annual increases in July, a Reuters poll found, offering the central bank some hope a strengthening economic recovery will gradually lift inflation toward its 2 percent target.
But the projected 0.5 percent year-on-year increase will be well off the Bank of Japan's target and keep the central bank under pressure to maintain its massive monetary stimulus, analysts say.
""The increase is largely due to the effect of rising energy costs. Upward price pressure for other goods remains weak,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.4 percent in June from a year earlier.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were seen likely to rise 0.3 percent in August from a year earlier after a 0.2 percent gain in July, according to economists polled by Reuters.
The government will announce the consumer inflation data at 8:30 Tokyo time on Aug. 25 (2350 GMT Aug. 24).
More than four years of massive monetary stimulus has failed to accelerate inflation to the BOJ's 2 percent target, underscoring the difficulty of eradicating the deflation that has plagued the country for two decades.
The CPI data will follow news this week that Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up, heralding a long-awaited bounce in domestic demand.
Nonetheless, wage growth and inflation remain subdued as companies remain wary of passing more of their profits to employees.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home price growth slowed in July, with Beijing declining for a second straight month, reinforcing expectations that property price growth may stagnate over the course of the year. 
Government restrictions to keep prices in check weighed on larger cities, with July showing the slowest growth since August 2016, while smaller centers pulled back but remained robust.
Policymakers have prioritized stabilizing the property market ahead of an autumn leadership reshuffle, stressing the need to avoid dramatic price fluctuations that could threaten the financial system and harm social stability.
As China's home price rises have generally been moderating and sales are slowing, analysts do not see a major risk of a sharp price fall or crash, given the strength of underlying housing demand. 
""We need the administrative measures in the short term but keeping them long-term would be a retreat for the market economy,"" said Joe Zhou, Head of Research for China at Jones Lang LaSalle (N:JLL). 
Nonetheless, developers expect the curbs to be longer-term.Ouyang Jie, vice-president of Shanghai-listed Future Land (SS:601155), believes the controls will be in place for the next five years, under the new government that follows a leadership reshuffle in the autumn.
""We think the current restrictions on purchases, borrowing and price growth will continue for five years, but the price cap over new units may be relaxed gradually over the years,"" he said.
Analysts say the speculative switch to smaller cities and their large housing overhang has resulted in an alarming rise in debt in those centers.
Beihai, a small port city in the Guangxi region on China's southwest coast, had the biggest monthly price increase of 1.5 percent in July and posted robust annual growth of 14 percent.""I think the small city boom is a trap,"" JLL's Zhou said. ""It won't last long because I don't see the possibility of a huge drop in inventory there while there is not enough population inflow to support demand.""
While the statistics bureau says the housing market should still be able to maintain stable growth, many economists expect the residential sector to lose momentum in the second half of the year in the face of policy tightening and an official financial deleveraging campaign.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.4 percent in July from the previous month, slowing from the 0.7 percent growth in June as policymakers battled to rein in demand. In China's biggest markets, Beijing's new home prices fell 0.1 percent in July, after declining 0.4 percent in June. Shanghai prices stalled while Shenzhen prices fell by 0.2 percent from a month ago. 
Compared with a year ago, new home prices rose 9.7 percent in July, easing from a 10.2 percent gain in June and marking the slowest growth since August 2016, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data.
New construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developers' confidence, contracted for the first time since last September, falling 7 percent in July from a year ago, compared to a 14 percent increase in June. 
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 561.6 billion Chinese yuan ($84.13 billion) in July from 738.4 billion yuan in June, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data.
But household loans as a proportion of total new loans rose to 68 percent from 48 percent in June, suggesting banks were more exposed to the property market even though it cooled in July.

In the poll, 19 out of 20 analysts predicted that Bank Indonesia (BI) would hold the 7-day reverse repurchase rate  at 4.75 percent, where it has been since October.
The other analyst forecast that BI would cut the key rate by 25 basis points. 
On Wednesday, BI Governor Agus Martowardojo gave a hint of potential policy easing ""if all indicators support it"". He said the central bank is ""pretty happy"" with the annual inflation rate, which was 3.88 percent in July. 
But some analysts believe that a negative impact on the rupiah  stands in the way of a rate cut. This year, the rupiah has strengthened about 0.8 percent against the dollar, less than most emerging Asian currencies have moved against the greenback. 
""BI is set to reiterate its commitment to maintain financial system stability, and the rupiah (vs US dollar) in particular,"" said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore. 
In early August, Indonesia reported that gross domestic product grew 5.01 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier - less than forecast - as private consumption remained lethargic.
To try to lift the growth rate, BI in 2016 cut its benchmark rate six times, by a total of 1.50 percentage points. In spite of the cuts, lending has been increasing at a slower pace than the central bank wants, and the economic growth rate has remained around 5 percent instead of nearing the 7 percent level President Joko Widodo wants. 

Eight of 10 analysts in the poll who gave a forecast for the benchmark interest rate at the end of 2017 see BI keeping it at 4.75 percent. The other two predicted a 25 basis point rate cut to 4.50 percent.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2017 12:14PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; autos weigh on manufacturing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to near a six-month low last week, pointing to a further tightening in the labor market that could encourage the Federal Reserve to lay out a plan to start unwinding its massive bond portfolio.
A weakening automobile sector is, however, adding a wrinkle to an otherwise brightening economic picture. Other data on Thursday showed manufacturing output fell in July as motor vehicle production tumbled. Auto manufacturers are cutting back production amid weak sales that have created an inventory glut.
""Today's data were constructive towards our expectation of another robust rise in real GDP growth in the third quarter and further labor market improvement,"" said Dana Peterson, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""The readings support our conjecture that low inflation notwithstanding, the conditions for the Fed to announce balance sheet unwind are ripe.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended Aug. 12, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 25 when claims fell to 227,000, which was the best reading since March 1973. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market, for 128 weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The unemployment rate is 4.3 percent. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 500 to 240,500 last week. 
Labor market strength was corroborated by a survey from the Philadelphia Fed showing manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region sharply increased hours for workers in August amid a jump in new orders and unfilled orders.
Job market buoyancy is probably sufficient for the Fed to outline a proposal to begin offloading its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September. 
Concerns about persistently low inflation could, however, prompt the U.S. central bank to delay increasing interest rates until December. Minutes of the Fed's July 25-26 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers appeared increasingly cautious about weak inflation, with some urging against further rate hikes.
The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies in midday trading, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose marginally. U.S. stocks fell as investors worried about President Donald Trump's ability to pursue his pro-growth economic policies. 
Trump on Wednesday disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils after a number of chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Virginia last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists.
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH Last week's claims data covered the survey week for the August nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 3,500 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job growth. 
Payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs in July. The economy has added 1.29 million jobs this year and the unemployment rate has fallen five-tenths of a percentage point. 
In a second report on Thursday, the Fed said manufacturing output edged down 0.1 percent in July as the production of motor vehicles and parts tumbled 3.6 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent in June.
The drop in motor vehicle production, the third straight monthly decline, came after a sharp slowdown in sales. U.S. auto sales peaked in December 2016 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just over 18 million vehicles, according to data from WardsAuto. The annual sales rate had slumped to around 16.7 million vehicles as of July. 
Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent in July. The sector accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
""The manufacturing rebound continues to blossom, but the motor vehicle sector is not going to share in the gains until the middle of 2018,"" said Michael Montgomery, an economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.
The outlook for manufacturing is encouraging. While a third report from the Philadelphia Fed showed its index of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slipped to 18.9 this month from 19.5 in July, manufacturers reported robust demand for their products. 
The survey's measure of new orders surged to 20.4 from 2.1 in July. Firms also reported that shipments continued to rise. 
As a result, workers put in more hours. The average workweek index increased to 18.8 in August from 3.8 in the prior month.

A survey this week from the New York Fed also painted an upbeat picture of manufacturing conditions in New York state.

Policymakers believed there was a risk that the currency could ""overshoot"" the meeting minutes showed.
“While most of the recent gyrations in prices of financial assets were down to the region’s economic recovery, “concerns were expressed about a possible overshooting in the repricing by … markets, notably the foreign exchange markets, in the future,” the minutes said.
“It was underlined that the still favorable financing conditions could not be taken for granted and relied to a considerable extent on a continued high degree of monetary policy support.”
The minutes cited two factors in the euro's rise, the first being the removal of political risk following the election of Emmanuel Macron as France’s president. The second factor was market expectations over U.S. interest rates.
“These two factors were now largely priced out, leaving the euro back around the levels prevailing before the UK referendum.”
Last month the ECB held interest rates and asset purchases steady, amid speculation that it will start to scale back its ultra-loose monetary policy in the autumn."

Retail sales volumes grew by 0.3 percent month-on-month in July, a shade above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 0.2 percent rise, the Office for National Statistics said, and the same as a downwardly revised reading for June. 
Looking at the three months to July as a whole, which smooths out monthly volatility in the data, sales growth dropped to 0.6 percent from an unchanged 1.5 percent for the second quarter, the strongest calendar quarter since Q3 2016.
Rising inflation has eaten into British consumers' disposable income this year, causing the weakest first quarter for retail sales since 2010, as the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote pushed up the cost of the imports. 
Compared with a year earlier, growth in sales volumes was the slowest since November 2013 at 1.8 percent.
Official data on Wednesday showed that wages in the second quarter were 0.5 percent lower in real terms than in 2016, one of the biggest falls in the past three years.
There are some signs, however, that the rapid rise in inflation - which has quadrupled over the past year - is starting to level off. 
The Bank of England expects inflation to peak at around 3 percent in October, compared with 2.6 percent now.
The volume of purchases of almost all categories of goods other than food dropped in July, the ONS said.
""The underlying trend at the beginning of 2017 showed a relatively subdued picture for retail sales,"" said ONS statistician Ole Black. ""Whilst the overall growth (in July) is the same as in June, trends in growth in different sectors are proving quite volatile.""
Clothing sales fell by the most since December 2016 last month, after hotter than usual weather had boosted demand in June.
Weaker consumer demand is a key reason why many economists predict growth will slow this year, though the BoE expects stronger exports and business investment to largely compensate.
Figures from consumer research company Nielsen earlier on Thursday showed the highest proportion of Britons in two years tried to cut spending in the second quarter of 2017. 
The chief executive of one of Britain's biggest car dealership chains Lookers (L:LOOK) told Reuters on Wednesday he now expects the British new car market to shrink by 3 percent this year, downgrading his outlook due to Brexit and political uncertainty.

The unemployment rate slipped to 5.6 percent from an upwardly revised 5.7 percent in June as 27,900 new jobs were added, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.
But the gain was led solely by a jump of 48,200 in part-time work. Full-time jobs stumbled in July after a strong run recently. They still account for almost all of the gains in employment this year.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had welcomed a sharp turnaround in the labor market this year after full-time jobs fell 23,100 in 2016. But policymakers continue to fret over high spare capacity and its impact on wages growth which is languishing at record lows of 1.90 percent.
That is also putting downward pressure on inflation which remains below the RBA's 2 percent to 3 percent target band, forcing the RBA to slash interest rates twice last year to a record low 1.50 percent. It has stood pat on policy since then.
The underemployment rate, which measures people wanting to work more hours, was still near record highs.
Still, the RBA is confident of a revival with measures of business confidence and conditions at a decade high.
""The past volatility of the data means it pays not to get too excited by strong employment data and not to get too worried by weak data,"" said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics.

The data underscores the Bank of Japan's view the world's third-largest economy is showing increasing signs of strength as private consumption adds momentum to an export-led recovery.
Imports rose for the seventh straight month on brisk demand for personal computers and digital cameras from China, highlighting the strength of domestic consumption that served as a key driver of Japan's economic growth in the second quarter.
""Exports aren't particularly strong in volume terms but will gradually recover ahead. The import figures, on the other hand, underscore the strength of domestic demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Domestic demand is gaining momentum and will likely drive Japan's economic recovery.""
Exports to the United States rose 11.5 percent in July from a year earlier to mark the sixth straight month of gains. That pushed up Japan's trade surplus with the United States by 9.1 percent from a year ago to 647 billion yen ($5.88 billion).
Japan's trade surplus has been a target of criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has called for cutting the U.S. trade deficit under his protectionist ""America First"" policies.
Total exports increased 13.4 percent in July from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Thursday, roughly in line with a median market forecast for a 13.6 percent gain.
The rise, which followed a 9.7 percent increase in June, was driven by solid auto shipments to the United States and demand from China for electrical equipment, the data showed.
But the gain in exports was more modest in volume terms at 2.6 percent, suggesting the value of exports was inflated by the yen's declines during the month.
Total imports were up 16.3 percent in July from a year earlier, roughly in line with a median market forecast for a 17.0 percent gain. It followed a 15.5 percent rise in June.
UPTREND INTACT
Shipments to Asia were up 14.8 percent in July from a year earlier, while those to China rose 17.6 percent to mark a ninth straight rising month.
Japan's manufacturing activity grew in July at the slowest pace in eight months as export demand weakened, a private survey showed earlier this month, casting some doubt on the strength of Asian trade.
""Exports clearly rose in July, indicating that a slight decline in second-quarter exports was a brief interruption of an ongoing uptrend,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up, highlighting a long-awaited bounce in domestic demand.
Negative external demand, or exports minus imports, shaved off some growth in the quarter as shipments of information-technology goods to Asia slowed, though many analysts expect exports to remain firm in coming quarters.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2017 11:23PM ET</span>",Malaysia seen posting slightly slower second-quarter growth on softer domestic demand,"By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy is expected to have grown at a slightly slower pace in the second quarter due to weaker private consumption, even as trade remained robust.
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy likely grew 5.4 percent in April-May from a year earlier, easing from 5.6 percent in the first quarter, according to the median of forecasts by 12 economists polled by Reuters.
Growth in the first quarter was the strongest in two years, but the pace has been expected to fade, Vaninder Singh of NatWest Markets said in a note last week.
Cement production had slumped 17.1 percent over March-May, compared with 9.6 percent growth in the previous three-month period, he said.
Crude oil prices have also skidded around 10 percent so far this year, after several failed attempts to rally. Malaysia is a significant oil and gas producer in the region.
""With growth slowing over the rest of the year – and maybe even turning sub-potential – we expect the BNM to leave rates unchanged this year,"" Singh said, referring to the central bank.
With inflation remaining moderate, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has kept its overnight policy rate <MYINTR=ECI> steady at 3.00 percent since last July, when it trimmed it by 25 basis points.
Exports have also shown some signs of fatigue after a strong start to the year. Shipments grew 10 percent in June, well short of the 15.8 percent forecast by a Reuters poll and sharply down from May's 32.5 percent growth.
But economists at Nomura argue the June weakness may be transitory, pointing to continued robust demand globally.
Private consumption will likely moderate over the second quarter, even as wage and employment numbers remain ""encouraging"", HSBC said in a note.
""We expect overall momentum to cool in most parts of the economy,"" the bank said.
Also hobbling domestic demand, Malaysian households have high levels of debt, which Capital Economics estimate to be equivalent to around 90 percent of GDP.
POLL GAMBIT
Strong economic growth is vital for Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is considering early polls to offset the effects of rising living costs on his popularity and a growing challenge from his former mentor turned foe, Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib, however, will likely want to roll out special stimulus measures and cash handouts for rural and lower-income voters in the next budget to bolster his chances, Nomura said.
""We expect these to be targeted, which should limit their impact on the fiscal consolidation agenda,"" said the research house.

Najib is expected to call an election earlier than the scheduled time of mid-2018, as he may want to take advantage of an economic recovery and a currently fractured opposition.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2017 11:11PM ET</span>","Philippines second-quarter GDP growth quickens on construction boom, tops forecast","By Enrico Dela Cruz
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine economy grew at a sizzling pace in the second quarter, topping expectations as a government-led construction boom and an extended rebound in the farm sector took some of the sting off a peso currency wallowing at 11-year lows.
The Southeast Asian nation is the second-fastest growing economy in Asia after China, with growth in the June quarter boosted by higher government spending and a stellar performance in the agriculture sector.
Gross domestic product rose 6.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said on Thursday, picking up from the 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, and above the 6.2 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP expanded 1.7 percent, above the 1.6 percent growth projected in a Reuters poll, and faster than the previous quarter's upwardly revised 1.3 percent.
""We are well on track to meeting our full-year target growth of 6.5-7.5 percent,"" Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told reporters at a briefing.
Like its regional peers, the Philippines benefited from an improvement in global demand, with exports up nearly 14 percent in the six months to June.
Household consumption grew at slightly faster annual pace of 5.9 percent in the second quarter compared with 5.8 percent in the first, while government spending jumped 7.1 percent in a dramatic rise from the revised 0.1 percent gain in the March quarter.
The peso was steady after the GDP report, though markets remain focused on the currency's outlook following a sharp slide.
Policymakers have sought to soothe frayed nerves in the foreign exchange market after the peso hit an 11-year low, saying currency movements do not reflect the underlying strength of the local economy.
A construction boom in the Philippines has contributed to the peso weakening amid a recent surge in capital goods imports.
Indeed, Manila aims to lift growth to as much as 7.5 percent this year, from 6.9 percent in 2016, as President Rodrigo Duterte's administration prepares for a six-year, $180 billion spending spree on infrastructure.
The big spending plan to repair creaking infrastructure and build new roads, railways and airports form part of an ambitious effort by Duterte to boost growth in the $290 billion consumption-reliant economy to around the 8 percent level.
""We are optimistic that the accelerated state spending and project implementation would keep the Philippines in the club of Asia's fastest-growing economies,"" Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said in a statement.

The BCC said its 'trade confidence index' - a measure based on export documentation provided by regional chambers of commerce during the three months to June - was 2.5 percent lower than a year earlier, though still high by historic standards.
""Whilst UK businesses continue to deliver a strong export performance, they are increasingly concerned about what lies on the economic horizon,"" said Ian Wilson, chief executive of the British operations of delivery company DHL Express, which sponsored the report.
Official data last week showed Britain's trade deficit in goods and services was its widest in nine months in June, contrasting with most business surveys which have painted a much more upbeat picture.
Sterling's fall of around 14 percent since last year's Brexit vote has boosted the short-term competitiveness of British exporters, but there is little clarity on access to European Union markets after Britain leaves in March 2019.
Britain's government outlined plans for a future customs agreement with the EU on Tuesday and an interim deal to ease companies' Brexit concerns, but the proposals were described as ""fantasy"" by one senior EU official.

The BCC said that the proportion of manufacturers reporting stronger exports rose slightly in the second quarter, though orders slipped slightly. Services exporters also saw growth in exports and orders, albeit from a lower base.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2017 04:30PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers grow more worried about weak inflation,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers appeared increasingly wary about recent weak inflation and some called for halting interest rate hikes until it was clear the trend was transitory, according to the minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting.
The readout of the July 25-26 meeting, released on Wednesday, also indicated the Fed was poised to begin reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Last month's meeting, which concluded with a unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged, was marked by a lengthy discussion about the recent soft inflation readings, the minutes showed.
The central bank's preferred inflation measure dropped to 1.5 percent in June from 1.8 percent in February and has remained below its 2 percent target for more than five years.
""Many participants ... saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected, and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
The inflation retreat has spurred concerns the Fed may have to cool its monetary tightening pace even though the economy is growing moderately and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in July, matching a 16-year low touched in May.
The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight lending rate twice this year and forecasts one more rise before the end of 2017.
Some policymakers argued last month against future rate rises until there was more concrete evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Fed's objective, according to the minutes.
Others, however, cautioned that such a delay could cause an eventual overshooting in inflation given a tightening labor market ""that would likely be costly to reverse.""
BALANCE SHEET REDUCTION
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said, ""I'm not one who would like to see inflation be at 2 percent before we continue on the path"" of rate hikes because policy affects the economy with a lag.
""On the other hand, we do have to take into account that we have had weak readings on inflation,"" Mester added.
Senior Fed officials have largely dismissed the inflation softness as temporary. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that special factors, including price drops for mobile phone plans and prescription drugs, were partly responsible.
Voting members of the Fed' rate-setting committee agreed to monitor inflation closely in light of the concerns, with a few policymakers cautioning that the central bank's framework for analyzing inflation was ""not particularly useful,"" according to the minutes.
""What it boils down to is what inflation will do between here and December,"" said Eric Winograd, an economist at Alliance Bernstein, who still expects the Fed to raise rates again at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.
The dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks ended slightly stronger after paring earlier gains and prices of U.S. Treasuries were higher.
Fed policymakers at last month's meeting also cast a keener light on financial stability and agreed it was important to look for signs of declining market volatility or concentration of investors in particular assets.
Elsewhere in the minutes, Fed officials reinforced expectations of an announcement in September to begin reducing the central bank's holdings of bonds that were bought in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
Several policymakers were prepared to announce a start date last month, but the Fed decided to wait as ""most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting.""

Fed officials have been priming markets for a probable move at their next policy meeting on Sept. 19-20. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday the expectation of such an announcement next month was not unreasonable.

The details of the meeting, at which the U.S. central bank voted to keep rates unchanged, also showed that ""some participants"" expressed concerns about the slowdown in inflation, and said the Fed could afford to stand pat on interest rates until the decline in inflation subsided.
""... some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened, and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation,"" the minutes said. ""They observed that the Committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further""
On the Fed's plan to reduce its $4.5tn balance sheet, members agreed that the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities should begin ""relative soon"" while others wanted to wait until the upcoming policy meeting.
""Participants generally agreed that, in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon,"" the minutes said
Riskier assets ticked lower while gold added to gains as market participants viewed the minutes as dovish, after Fed members appeared less willing to view the slowdown in inflation as transitory.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage refinancing activity increased 1.6 percent to 1,455.9 in the week ended Aug. 11. This was the strongest reading since 1,526.8 in the week ending June 16.
The refinancing share of total applications rose to 47.8 percent from 46.7 percent the previous week.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.12 percent, a nine-month low, from 4.14 percent the prior week, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average rates on other types of fixed-rate mortgages that the MBA tracks declined by 1 to 6 basis points from the prior week.
However, lower borrowing costs didn't increase applications for home purchases last week.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted barometer on purchase mortgage activity, a proxy on future home sales, slipped 1.5 percent to 233.8.
While housing demand remained brisk, home construction hit a soft patch in the second quarter and has yet to rebound.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in July as the construction of multi-family houses tumbled to a 10-month low, but strong job growth is expected to continue to support the housing market recovery.
Housing starts declined 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million units, hurt also by a drop in groundbreaking on single-family projects, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. 
June's sales pace was revised down to 1.21 million units from the previously reported 1.22 million units.
Building permits dropped 4.1 percent, with the multi-family segment recording a drop of 11.2 percent. Permits for single-family homes were unchanged. The report tempered hopes of a sharp rebound in homebuilding investment after it fell in the second quarter at its steepest pace in nearly seven years.
""Soft July starts following on June's solid reading is a disappointment as we had expected housing to pick up more robustly from a soft second quarter,"" said Andrew Labelle, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Still, we are inclined to look through some of the pullback as it was concentrated in generally lower value and more volatile multi-family.""
Housing subtracted 0.27 percentage point from second-quarter gross domestic product. Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity to be little changed at a rate of 1.22 million units in July. Homebuilding fell 5.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Housing starts are well below their historic average of 1.5 million, a rate realtors say would eliminate an acute shortage of houses on the market that has driven up prices. Completions fell 6.2 percent to 1.18 million-pace last month.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher, in line with a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), were little changed as were those of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN). Pultegroup (N:PHM) shares gained 0.31 percent. 
The dollar (DXY) strengthened against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government bonds rose marginally.
MODEST GROWTH 
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for home loans fell last week. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, slipped 0.5 percent to a rate of 856,000 units last month. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and South but fell in the West and Midwest.
""We expect residential investment to keep moving up over time, although we believe the pace of growth will be modest,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Despite strong demand for housing, which is being driven by a labor market that is near full employment, groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. 
Homebuilders continue to complain they cannot find skilled labor, especially framers, and that buildable lots remain in short supply. Builders also say the costs of their materials are rising. Prices for building materials were increasing even before the U.S. government slapped anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber in April.
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders increased in August amid rising demand for new houses.
Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment tumbled 15.3 percent to a rate of 299,000 units. Groundbreaking for buildings with five units or more plunged 17.1 percent to its lowest level since September 2016.
Multi-family homebuilding is slowing as apartment buildings flood the market, leading to a rise in the rental vacancy rate this year.
""The recovery in the multi-family sector may have played out and the sector is in the process of consolidating and finding a sustainable level of activity,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of June fell to 4.4 percent, against the average forecast for it to hold at 4.5 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
But the figures on wage growth showed the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May and her government, with households feeling the strain of rising prices since last year's Brexit vote.
While inflation has eased slightly since May when it hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent, prices are still rising faster than wages.
The Office for National Statistics said workers' total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.1 percent in the three months to June, compared with 1.9 percent in the period to May, but this was boosted by bonus payments in the financial sector.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 1.8 percent.
Overall wage growth in real terms fell by 0.5 percent.
Excluding bonuses - which analysts say gives a better picture of the underlying trend - earnings in nominal terms rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year, unchanged from May and against expectations for a 2.0 percent rise.

The second quarter data, due on Thursday, will be closely watched by investors nervous about a weakening peso with any uncertainty over the outlook for growth likely to pile pressure on the beleaguered currency.
Manila aims to lift growth to as much as 7.5 percent this year, from 6.9 percent in 2016, as President Rodrigo Duterte's administration prepares for a six-year, $180 billion spending spree on infrastructure.

Economists in a Reuters poll estimated GDP grew 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in the three months ended June, quickening from 1.1 percent in the first quarter, though only five of 14 analysts gave sequential forecasts.
From a year earlier, the economy is expected to have expanded by 6.2 percent in the June quarter. Although slower than the first quarter's 6.4 percent pace, it would still make the Philippines the second-fastest growing economy in Asia after China. 
""Private consumption expenditure is estimated to have remained robust, boosted by continued expansion in remittances from workers abroad and rapid expansion in household credit,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.
""Infrastructure spending and residential construction are also expected to have been strong,"" Biswas added.
PESO NERVES 
Policymakers have sought to soothe frayed nerves in the foreign exchange market after the peso hit an 11-year low, saying currency movements do not reflect the underlying strength of the local economy.
A construction boom in the Philippines has contributed to the peso weakening amid a recent surge in capital goods imports.
ING economist Joey Cuyegkeng, who gave a 6.3 forecast for second quarter GDP, said growth could be higher after data on Tuesday showed farm output expanded more than 6 percent in the April-June, better than his forecast.
A stronger-than-expected GDP print could attract portfolio flows, Cuyegkeng said, which could help the peso - Asia's worst performer so far this year - pare its losses against the dollar. 
Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said last week a 7 percent growth rate in the June quarter was possible, because of improving exports and higher public spending.
Treasury data showed government spending climbed more than 16 percent in the second quarter from the first.
The Philippines has clocked 73 quarters of uninterrupted growth, allowing the central bank to leave policy settings on hold since it raised interest rates by 25 basis points in September 2014.
The International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2017 growth forecast for the Philippines to 6.6 percent from 6.8 percent, but was optimistic the economy would grow strongly in the medium term.

Total U.S. household debt was $12.84 trillion in the three months to June, up $552 billion from a year ago, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report published on Tuesday. 
The proportion of overall debt that was delinquent, at 4.8 percent, was on par with the previous quarter. However a red flag was raised over the transitions of credit card balances into delinquency, which the New York Fed said ""ticked up notably.""
Loosening lending standards have allowed borrowers with lower credit scores to access credit cards, Andrew Haughwout, an in-house economist, said in the report.
""The current state of credit card delinquency flows can be an early indicator of future trends and we will closely monitor the degree to which this uptick is predictive of further consumer distress,"" he said.
Total U.S. indebtedness is about 14 percent above the trough of household deleveraging brought on by the 2007-2009 financial crisis and deep recession, a pull-back that interrupted what had been a 63-year upward trend. 

Mortgage debt was $8.69 trillion in the second quarter, up $329 billion from last year, the report said. Student loan debt was $1.34 trillion, up $85 billion, while auto loan debt came in at $1.19 trillion, up $55 billion.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2017 12:45PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. retail sales bolster third quarter growth outlook,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July as consumers boosted purchases of motor vehicles and raised discretionary spending, suggesting the economy continued to gain momentum early in the third quarter.
Retail sales for June and May also were revised higher, which should help to assuage concerns about consumer spending after a slowdown at the start of the year. Tuesday's upbeat report from the Commerce Department likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in December.
""American shoppers flocked to the malls in July, suggesting consumers are well-positioned to propel the economy forward in the second half of the year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""It should tamp down chatter about the Fed delaying rate hikes until next year."" 
Retail sales jumped 0.6 percent last month, the largest gain since December 2016. June's retail sales were revised to show a 0.3 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent drop.
Economists had forecast retail sales increasing 0.4 percent in July. May's retail sales were revised to show no change rather than the previously reported 0.1 percent dip. Retail sales increased 4.2 percent in July on a year-on-year basis. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales surged 0.6 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in June. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent in June.
The report helped to shift investors' attention from recent weak inflation data as markets try to forecast the Fed's next policy move. The U.S. central bank has raised rates twice this year and economists expect it will announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September.
The dollar (DXY) rose to near a three-week high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter after a tepid 1.9 percent pace in the January-March period. That boosted GDP growth to a 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter.
But persistently sluggish wage growth has pushed Americans to dip into their savings to fund spending. Economists say wage growth has to pick up to sustain consumer spending. Annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent.
LOW SAVINGS A CONCERN
The saving rate has dropped to 3.8 percent in the second quarter of this year from a rate of 6.2 percent in the second quarter of 2015. Low savings and tepid wage growth suggest households would need to borrow to maintain spending.
""The decline in the saving rate, however, raises some longer-term concerns about consumer spending,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Savings can't drop indefinitely and future consumption growth will need to rely on stronger income growth.""
For now, the near-term outlook for the economy is brightening. The retail sales report prompted the Atlanta Fed to raise its third-quarter GDP estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.7 percent rate. 
A second report on Tuesday from the New York Fed showed its Empire State general business conditions index climbed 15.4 points to 25.2 in August, the highest level in nearly three years. Manufacturers in the region reported a jump in new orders and said they were taking longer to deliver goods.
While a third report from the Commerce Department showed the biggest gain in business inventories in seven months in June, the stock accumulation appeared planned amid rising sales.
Retail sales in July were lifted by a 1.2 percent jump in motor vehicle sales, the biggest rise since December 2016. Sales were likely boosted by hefty discounts as auto dealerships try to reduce inventory. 
Prices for new motor vehicles recorded their biggest drop in nearly eight years in July and have decreased for six straight months. A fourth report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed imported motor vehicle prices fell in July for the second consecutive month.
Retail sales in July were also buoyed by a 1.2 percent increase in receipts at building material stores. Sales at online retailers vaulted 1.3 percent last month, the largest gain since December 2016, likely buoyed by Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime Day promotion.
Sales at restaurants and bars rose 0.3 percent as did receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores. 

But sales at electronics and appliance stores slipped 0.5 percent last month. Sales at clothing stores fell 0.2 percent. Clothing retailers are struggling with falling traffic in shopping malls and increased competition from Amazon and other online retailers.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that business inventories rose 0.5 percent after an unrevised 0.3 percent increase in May.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Retail inventories gained 0.6 percent in June as announced in an advance report last month. Retail inventories rose 0.6 percent in May.
Motor vehicle inventories increased 0.7 percent as previously reported after surging 1.2 percent in May.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5 percent as reported last month. They rose 0.2 percent in May.
Inventory investment had a neutral impact on the second quarter's 2.6 percent annualized growth pace after chopping off 1.46 percentage points at the start of the year.
Business sales rose 0.3 percent in June after edging up 0.1 percent in May. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.37 months in May.

The inventories-to-sales ratio for motor vehicles was unchanged at 2.25 months in June.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday that import prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after an unrevised 0.2 percent drop in June. Last month's increase was in line with economists' expectations and left the 12-month increase at 1.5 percent.
The year-on-year increase in import prices has slowed sharply since hitting 4.7 percent in February, which was the biggest advance in five years.
Imported inflation has been dampened by a strong dollar. With the greenback falling 6.6 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year, price pressures are expected to start creeping up.
Prices for imported petroleum increased 0.7 percent in July after decreasing 2.9 percent in June.
Import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after rising 0.1 percent in the prior month. Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0.9 percent in the 12 months through July.
Prices for imported capital goods nudged up 0.1 percent. Imported motor vehicle prices fell 0.2 percent for a second straight month. The cost of imported food increased 0.6 percent.

The report also showed export prices rebounded 0.4 percent in July, the biggest gain since December 2016, after falling 0.2 percent in June. Export prices increased 0.8 percent on a year-on-year basis after rising 0.6 percent in the 12 months through June.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong household and state spending consolidated Germany's role as the euro zone's growth engine in the second quarter, helping Chancellor Angela Merkel to burnish her economic credentials less than six weeks before an election.
Tuesday's data are the last major growth figures to be published before the Sept. 24 vote, in which Merkel is seeking to win a fourth term.
Merkel's conservatives enjoy a comfortable lead over the Social Democrats (SPD), their current coalition partner; an INSA poll on Tuesday put their support at 37 percent to the SPD's 25.
Yet while neither party wants another grand coalition, a fractured political landscape could make it hard to form another viable alliance.
In the second quarter, Germany's seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) was up 0.6 percent from the previous quarter - just below the consensus forecast of 0.7 percent in a Reuters poll, but still the 12th consecutive quarterly growth reading.
In addition, first-quarter growth was revised up to 0.7 percent from 0.6. Annual growth in the second quarter, adjusted for calendar effects, rose to 2.1 percent from 2.0.
""The German economy is proving its staying power, the upswing continues,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that the European Central Bank's low interest rates and bond-buying programme kept on boosting domestic demand.
Germany's Constitutional Court said it had declined to hear a challenge to the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.7 trillion) asset purchase scheme, referring the case instead to the European Court of Justice.
DOMESTIC DEMAND
Second-quarter growth was mainly driven by domestic demand as households and state authorities increased their spending and firms boosted investment in buildings and equipment, the Statistics Office said.
German consumers are benefiting from record employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs. State authorities are also spending billions of euros on accommodating and integrating more than one million refugees who have arrived since the start of 2015, many from war zones in Syria and Iraq.
In addition, a growing population, increased job security and record-low interest rates are fuelling a construction boom in Europe's biggest economy.
Growth in the second quarter was dampened, however, by net foreign trade, since exports rose less strongly than imports, which the vibrant domestic economy sucked in at a higher rate.
""Germany's economic success story goes on and on and on,"" ING Bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said, adding there was very little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance.
He cautioned, however, that the main drivers supporting the domestic economy, such as rising employment, rising wages and increased government spending, could lose some momentum in the coming quarters.
""The same holds for the export sector, where a stronger euro, weaker-than-expected U.S. growth and Brexit uncertainty could take some wind out of the sails without bringing exports to a halt,"" Brzeski said.
EUROPE'S ENGINE
Unadjusted data showed the economy growing by 0.8 percent on the year in the second quarter. Easter fell in April this year while it was in March last year.
The Statistics Office provided only a qualitative assessment of the main growth drivers in the second quarter. A more detailed breakdown will be published on Aug. 25.
The data underlines the continued strength of the German economy compared with its European peers.
The French economy, the second-largest in the euro zone, grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter, helped by stronger exports, according to preliminary data.
In Italy, the third-biggest economy in the 19-member bloc, the national central bank expects a quarterly expansion roughly in line with the first quarter's increase of 0.4 percent. Preliminary data are due on Wednesday.
The Spanish economy keeps powering ahead, however, with a growth rate of 0.9 percent in the April-June quarter.
This was well above the euro zone average of 0.6 percent, according to preliminary estimates released by the European Union's statistics agency this month.

Outside the euro zone, Britain's economic output grew by 0.3 percent on the quarter, edging up from 0.2 percent in the first three months.

The PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 123.8 in June from 122.0 the month before, while the annual gain accelerated to 5 percent from 3 percent in May.
""This looks like a very positive report for the Canadian economy,"" said PayNet President Bill Phelan. ""These privately held companies are driving healthy growth in the Canadian economy and it's broad-based growth.""
The index of lending to construction companies rose to 145.3 from 140.2 as groundbreaking on new homes has been strong this year, despite signs of cooling in some parts of Canada's housing market.
Retail and transportation sector lending also climbed, but manufacturing dipped for a second straight month.
Diversification across industries will make the economy ""more resilient through economic cycles,"" while growth in both the west and the east of the country adds to the strength of the data, Phelan said. 
Lending increased in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, the country's four most populous provinces. 
Strengthening of the domestic economy prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates last month for the first time in nearly seven years. The central bank expects the economy to grow at a 3 percent annualized pace in the second quarter after a 3.7 percent first-quarter expansion.
Lending to medium-sized business dropped in June and the annual rate slowed, but the pace was a still-solid 3 percent.

The financial health of Canadian companies continued to look strong, with the share of small companies that were behind 30 days or more on their loans holding steady at 1.09 percent. Those that were 90 days or more in arrears also held steady, at 0.32 percent.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2017 05:00AM ET</span>",UK inflation holds steady in July as price pressures ease,"British consumer price inflation unexpectedly held steady last month as fuel prices fell amid other signs that the squeeze on households' spending power may slowly be starting to level off.
Official figures on Tuesday showed the pace at which manufacturers' raw material costs are rising slowed by the most in over five years as the initial impact of June 2016's vote to leave the European Union dropped out of annual comparisons.
Consumer price inflation held unchanged at 2.6 percent in July compared with the average expectation in a Reuters poll of economists for it to rise to 2.7 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
""Falling fuel prices, offset by (rises in) the costs of food, clothing and household goods, left the headline rate of inflation unchanged in July,"" ONS statistician James Tucker said.
Further price rises may still be in train, as the Bank of England predicted at the start of the month that inflation will reach around 3 percent in October, after earlier touching a four-year high of 2.9 percent in May.
Britain's biggest energy supplier, British Gas (L:CNA), has said it plans to increase electricity prices by 12.5 percent in September. And most rail fares will rise next year by 3.6 percent, July's rate of retail price inflation - an older measure that the ONS says is no longer reliable, but which is widely used in British commercial contracts.
However, a softer outlook for inflation will reduce the chance of more BoE policymakers joining the minority who are calling for a rate rise now.
There was some good news for manufacturers, who saw the inflation rate for raw materials drop to 6.5 percent from 10.0 percent, its lowest rate in a year and the sharpest month-to-month fall in that rate since April 2012.
Rising inflation has squeezed household incomes this year, causing spending and broader economic growth to slow, as wages have failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
Sterling has fallen 14 percent since the referendum against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro (=GBP), and the BoE has said this is why inflation is above its 2 percent target.
An ONS measure of core consumer price inflation - which strips out changes in the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - held steady at 2.4 percent compared with economists' expectations for it to rise to 2.5 percent.
Factory gate price inflation slowed slightly less than expected, dropping to 3.2 percent compared with forecasts of 3.1 percent.
The BoE expects CPI will only fall slowly, and to remain above its 2 percent target for the next three years, based on its experience of a previous fall in sterling 10 years ago at the start of the financial crisis. 
The ONS also released figures for house prices in June, which showed a 4.9 percent annual rise across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 5.0 percent in May, the weakest increase since March. Prices in London alone grew by 2.9 percent.

Excluding oil prices and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose by 2.4% from a year earlier, compared with economists' expectations for 2.5%.
Falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food, the ONS said.

Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the June quarter inflation data had been in line with the Bank's expectations and provided further confirmation that inflation had increased since 2016. Underlying inflation was ½ per cent in the June quarter and headline inflation was only slightly lower. Both Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation and measures of underlying inflation were running at a little under 2 per cent in year-ended terms.
Non-tradables inflation had reached its highest year-ended rate in two years in the June quarter, boosted by rises in tobacco excise and utilities prices. Market services inflation had increased since 2016, but remained low; around half of total costs in the market services sector are labour costs, and these had been subdued over recent years. Inflation in the costs of constructing a new dwelling had also increased over the prior year in all capital cities other than Perth and Adelaide. In contrast, rents had been increasing at a below-average pace in Sydney and Melbourne, had been falling in Perth and had been broadly stable in most other capital cities.
The prices of tradable consumer durable items had declined over the year, partly reflecting the appreciation of the exchange rate and heightened competition from foreign retailers. Inflation in food prices (excluding fruit and vegetables) had been running at low rates for several years. Supply disruptions from Cyclone Debbie had had relatively little net effect on fruit and vegetables prices in the June quarter. Fuel prices had fallen in the quarter, but had contributed 0.2 percentage points to headline inflation over the year.
Members noted that the Australian Bureau of Statistics intends to update the weights in the CPI in the December quarter 2017 CPI release, to reflect changes in consumers' spending behaviour over recent years. This was expected to lead to lower reported CPI inflation because the weights of items whose prices had fallen were likely to be higher, whereas the weights of items whose prices had risen were likely to be lower.
In their discussion of the outlook for the domestic economy, members noted that the Bank's forecasts for output growth and inflation were largely unchanged from three months earlier. They noted that the forecasts were conditioned on the assumption of no change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the forecast period, which extends to the end of 2019, and that this assumption was one source of uncertainty.
The available data on activity suggested that GDP growth had increased in the June quarter, following weaker-than-expected growth in the March quarter. Output growth was expected to reach around 3 per cent in year-ended terms during 2018 and 2019, which was a little higher than estimates of potential growth. The recent data had indicated that consumption growth had increased in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had risen strongly in April and May, and the increases had been broadly based both nationally and across spending categories. Beyond the June quarter, rising employment and stronger household income growth were expected to support consumption growth, which was forecast to be a little above its average of recent years.
Dwelling investment was expected to recover from the weakness in the March quarter, which was partly the result of wet weather in New South Wales, and remain at a high level over the following year or so, sustained by the large pipeline of residential building work already approved or under way. The number of new residential building approvals had stepped down since 2016 and members noted that, if approvals remained at current levels, construction activity could also begin to decline.
The established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had remained the strongest in the country, although conditions had eased since late 2016. Housing prices in Perth had declined a little further, while apartment price growth in Brisbane had been weak.
Turning to the business sector, members noted that activity in the mining sector was expected to be supported in the June quarter by stronger resource export volumes. Coking coal exports had returned to pre-cyclone levels in May, and liquefied natural gas exports had continued to increase. The decline in mining investment was expected to run its course in the following year or so and thereafter no longer be a drag on growth. Resource exports were expected to make a significant contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period.
Investment by non-mining businesses was expected to pick up later in the forecast period in response to stronger growth in demand. Businesses had continued to report above-average business conditions and members noted that many of the conditions that might typically be associated with stronger growth in investment were in place. Some indicators of non-mining investment, including recent strength in sales of commercial motor vehicles and the higher investment intentions recorded in the NAB survey, had been more positive in the period leading up to the meeting. The increase in the level of non-residential building approvals had also signalled a more positive outlook for private non-residential construction, although the pipeline of work to be done was at low levels. The pipeline of public infrastructure activity had increased over the previous few years, to be at its highest share of GDP since the mid 1980s. The expected increase in expenditure on public infrastructure had been reported as flowing into the order books of firms in the private sector.
Members observed that recent data had suggested further improvement in the labour market. Employment had increased in every state since the start of 2017, including solid growth in the mining-exposed states. This provided further evidence that the drag on economic activity from earlier declines in the terms of trade and falling mining investment were running their course. Over this period, around 165,000 full-time jobs had been created, labour force participation had risen and average hours worked had increased.
The unemployment rate had been little changed in June at 5.6 per cent and underemployment had edged lower over prior months. Indicators of labour demand had pointed to further employment growth and little change in the unemployment rate over coming quarters. By the end of the forecast period, the unemployment rate was expected to be just below 5½ per cent, slightly lower than forecast in May but still implying a degree of spare capacity in the labour market. Members observed that the recent improvement in labour market conditions and the increase in award wages should help support household incomes and thus spending. Some upside risk to spending could be envisaged if employment were to be higher than forecast. On the other hand, expectations of ongoing low wage growth could weigh on consumption growth. Spending could also be constrained by elevated levels of household debt, especially if housing market conditions were to weaken.
More broadly, members noted there was some uncertainty about the effect any decline in spare capacity in the labour market would have on wage and price inflation. Information from liaison indicated that some employers were finding it harder to attract workers with particular skills. If this were to broaden, wage growth could increase more quickly than forecast, which would see inflationary pressures also emerge more quickly. However, wage and price inflation had not increased by as much as expected in other economies around the world that are already close to full employment, which raised the possibility that low inflation in Australia might also persist longer than forecast.
Turning to the inflation forecast, members noted that underlying inflation was expected to be close to 2 per cent in the second half of 2017 and to edge higher over the subsequent two years. Most of the difference between headline and underlying inflation over the forecast period could be accounted for by further increases in tobacco excise and utilities prices. Retail electricity prices were expected to increase sharply in the September quarter, following the increases in retail prices in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia on 1 July, and the March quarter 2018, when similar increases were expected in Victoria. Members acknowledged that the second-round effects of higher utilities prices on retail prices through business costs were uncertain, partly because it was unclear when utilities contracts for businesses would be subject to renewal. Members also observed that energy is a relatively low share of costs for most businesses, although it is higher for some businesses that compete in international markets.
The inflation forecast partly reflected an expectation of a modest increase in wage growth as labour market conditions tightened further and the drag on activity and incomes from falls in mining investment and the terms of trade diminished. Working in the opposite direction were the effects of additional competition in the retail industry, the dampening effect of expanding housing supply on growth in rents, and the recent exchange rate appreciation. Headline inflation had been revised a little higher in the updated forecasts, mostly reflecting the prospect of faster growth in utilities prices, and was expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent over much of the forecast period.
Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that economic conditions had strengthened over the prior year and the improvement had broadened beyond international trade. In particular, growth in business investment had picked up in several advanced and emerging economies, including the United States, Canada, Japan and a number of economies in east Asia. Consumption growth had been resilient. Recent GDP data had generally confirmed earlier expectations and, accordingly, the forecast for global growth had been little changed since that published in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. A gradual increase in global inflationary pressures over the subsequent couple of years had seemed likely, as spare capacity in many advanced economies was expected to be absorbed, resulting in higher wage growth. However, as members noted, even though labour market conditions had already tightened in some advanced economies, wage growth and core inflation had remained subdued.
Growth in GDP in China had been a little stronger than expected in the June quarter, supported by accommodative financial conditions and expansionary fiscal policy. The strengthening in conditions in the industrial sector over recent months had been broadly based; construction activity had been resilient, although housing market policies introduced in some cities over the preceding year had been effective in lowering overall housing price inflation. Demand for both consumer goods and Chinese exports had picked up. The strength in manufacturing and construction activity had contributed to higher demand for steel. As a result, imports of iron ore, including from Australia, had trended higher and prices for iron ore and coking coal had increased since the previous meeting. The outlook for Australia's thermal coal exports had not benefited to the same extent, partly because there had been an increase in domestic Chinese production. The forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised up a little since May, but still implied a decline from their recent peak.
Growth in China was expected to ease in 2018 and 2019 because of structural factors such as a declining working-age population, as well as policies to address financial risks. Members noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy remained a significant source of uncertainty. In particular, it was unclear how the authorities would negotiate the difficult trade-off between growth and the build-up of leverage in the Chinese economy. To address risks in the shadow banking sector, the authorities had recently sought to improve coordination among financial regulators and had announced tighter regulatory measures. Members noted that such measures could be difficult to calibrate and that, as a result, financial conditions might tighten by more than expected.
GDP growth in the rest of east Asia looked to have been around estimates of potential in the first half of 2017, supported by accommodative policies as well as the increase in global trade growth. Members noted that many economies in this region were deeply integrated into global supply chains, particularly for semiconductors and other electronics. There had also been signs of a recovery in retail sales and a sharp increase in consumer confidence in South Korea, the largest economy in the region.
In the three largest advanced economies, investment growth had picked up and employment growth had supported growth in household incomes and consumption. GDP growth had picked up in the June quarter in the United States and had been above potential rates for some time in the euro area and Japan, which had experienced sizeable increases in exports as global economic conditions had improved. GDP growth in all three major advanced economies was expected to remain above estimates of potential growth over the forecast period. Unemployment rates had declined to low levels in all three economies and in the United States and Japan were below levels associated with full employment.
Members noted that over recent months most attention in international financial markets had been on changes in expectations regarding monetary policy. In a number of advanced economies, monetary policy was expected to be somewhat less accommodative than previously anticipated.
At its June meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased its policy rate and outlined plans for a gradual and predictable reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. More recently, the FOMC had indicated that the balance sheet reduction would be likely to begin relatively soon. Financial market participants continued to expect further increases in the US federal funds rate to occur more slowly than implied by the median projections of FOMC participants. At its July meeting, the European Central Bank had emphasised that monetary policy needed to remain very accommodative, but had also indicated that it will consider whether to reduce the pace of asset purchases at one of its forthcoming meetings. In July, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate for the first time in seven years and financial market participants expected further increases. Central banks in several other advanced economies had also adjusted their communication over recent months so as to remove earlier biases towards easier monetary policy.
Long-term government bond yields had responded to the changes in expectations for the stance of monetary policy, with yields in most major financial markets, as well as in Australia, having risen from their levels in early June. Members noted, however, that yields remained at low levels. In Japan, yields on 10-year government bonds had remained around zero during 2017, consistent with the Bank of Japan's policy of yield curve control.
Members observed that financial market conditions remained very favourable. Corporate financing conditions had continued to improve, with the increase in equity prices and decline in corporate bond spreads having continued over 2017 in the United States and the euro area.
In China, financial market conditions also remained accommodative, but had tightened since the end of 2016 as the authorities had instituted a range of measures to reduce leverage in financial markets. Bond yields had increased markedly since late 2016, despite a slight retracement in recent months, and corporate bond issuance had slowed following strong growth over the preceding several years. Members observed that credit availability to households and businesses had been relatively unaffected by the regulatory measures. The renminbi exchange rate had appreciated against the US dollar since the beginning of 2017, but had depreciated in trade-weighted terms. The Chinese authorities had increased their scrutiny of capital flows, resulting in a decline in net capital outflows, and the value of the People's Bank of China's foreign currency reserves had stabilised.
Members noted that there had been a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar over 2017, including against the Australian dollar. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the previous two months had resulted in it returning to 2015 levels in US dollar terms and to the levels of late 2014 on a trade-weighted basis.
In Australia, housing credit growth had been steady over the first half of 2017, as a decline in growth in housing credit extended to investors had been offset by a slight increase in growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers. Members discussed the relative increases in housing lending rates to investors compared with owner-occupiers and for interest-only loans compared with principal-and-interest loans. Overall, the average actual interest rate paid on all outstanding housing loans was estimated to have increased slightly since late 2016. Housing loan approvals to investors had declined in recent months, which pointed to some easing in growth in housing credit to investors. The share of interest-only housing loans in total loan approvals appeared to have declined noticeably in the June quarter in response to recent measures introduced by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) to improve lending standards. Moreover, there was evidence of some switching of existing interest-only loans to principal-and-interest loans.
Australian share prices had been broadly steady in recent months. Over July, bank share prices had retraced some of their earlier decline, in line with a rise in bank share prices globally and following APRA's announcement of additional capital requirements for the banking sector, which were only slightly higher than banks' current actual capital ratios. The major banks had been issuing increasingly longer-dated bonds, including two large US-denominated 30-year bond issues in July. Members noted that longer-dated bonds are favoured under the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirement, which will come into effect in 2018. Members also noted that Australian issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities had continued at the relatively strong pace seen since late 2016.
Financial market pricing had continued to suggest that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017, with some expectation of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018.
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the improvement in global economic conditions had continued, particularly in China and the euro area. Demand growth from the Chinese industrial sector had been stronger than expected and had contributed to higher commodity prices. Labour markets had continued to tighten in a number of economies, but inflation had generally remained subdued. There had been a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar. Consistent with that, a number of currencies were close to their highs of the previous few years against the US dollar, including the euro and the Canadian dollar. The Australian dollar also had risen to levels last seen in 2015.
Domestically, the outlook was little changed. The forecast was for GDP growth to increase to around 3 per cent during the forecast period, supported by the low level of interest rates. Business conditions had improved further and faster growth in non-mining business investment was expected. Inflation was still expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened. However, a further appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in inflation and economic activity than currently forecast.
Employment growth had been stronger over recent months, so the forecasts for the labour market were starting from a stronger position. Forward-looking indicators suggested that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually. Wage growth had remained low but was still expected to increase a little as conditions in the labour market improved. Members observed that recent strong employment growth would be likely to contribute to an increase in household disposable income, and therefore consumption growth, over the forecast period. However, ongoing low wage growth and the high level of debt on household balance sheets raised the possibility that consumption growth could be lower than forecast.
Members regarded conditions in the housing market and household balance sheets as continuing to warrant careful monitoring. Conditions in the housing market varied considerably around the country. While there were signs that conditions in the Sydney and Melbourne markets had eased somewhat, housing price growth in these two cities had remained relatively strong. In some other housing markets, prices had been declining. Borrowers investing in residential property had been facing higher interest rates and growth in credit to investors had eased, but overall housing credit growth had continued to outpace the relatively slow growth in household incomes.
Taking account of the available information and the need to balance the risks associated with high household debt in a low-inflation environment, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."
144,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2017 08:20AM ET</span>",Japan second-quarter GDP blows past expectations on robust domestic demand,"By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up, highlighting a long-awaited bounce in domestic demand.
The world's third-largest economy expanded by a much stronger-than-expected annualized rate of 4.0 percent in April-June, posting its longest uninterrupted run of growth in a decade, government data showed on Monday.
Activity is expected to continue to improve in coming quarters, offering the Bank of Japan (BOJ) hope that a tight labor market is finally starting to boost wages and consumer spending, which in turn should make it easier to generate sustained inflation.
The rosy data was also a vindication for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, which has faced criticism that its economic agenda has not done enough to revive the country's fortunes.
""The engines of consumer spending and capital expenditure both fired well in the second quarter, and that's why domestic demand was so strong,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The pace of growth may moderate slightly, but we are still in recovery mode. This is a positive development for inflation.""
Gross domestic product expanded an annualized 4.0 percent in April-June, government data showed, more than the median estimate for 2.5 percent annualized growth and the biggest increase since January-March 2015.
Compared to the previous quarter, the economy expanded 1.0 percent, versus the median estimate for 0.6 percent growth.
Japan's growth had been largely reliant on robust exports earlier in the year, though there were signs private consumption was picking up.
Annualized GDP for previous quarter was revised up to a 1.5 percent increase, while quarterly real (inflation adjusted) GDP was revised up to 0.4 percent growth from a 0.3 percent increase.
The economy grew for six straight quarters in April-June. The last time the economy had a run of six consecutive quarters of growth was January-March 2005 through April-June 2006.
Private consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, rose 0.9 percent from the previous quarter, more than the median estimate of 0.5 percent growth.
That marked the fastest expansion in more than three years as shoppers splashed out on durable goods such as cars and home appliances. Consumers also spent more money on dining out, the data showed. These are all encouraging signs that consumer spending is no longer the weak spot in Japan's economic outlook.
Employees' wages rose 0.7 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, which was the biggest increase since July-September last year and another sign of the economy's vigor.
""The fact that the economy was able to grow this much without gains in exports shows our fundamentals are solid,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Consumption gains could slow a little in the following quarter, but the foundations for a recover in consumer spending are in place.""
Capital expenditure jumped by 2.4 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, doubling the median estimate for a 1.2 percent increase. That was the fastest growth in business investment since January-March 2014 as companies spent more on software and construction equipment.
Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi was more cautious on the outlook for domestic demand and pledged to implement extra measures to strengthen the economy.
""If you ask me whether private consumption has fully recovered, I would say it still lacks strength in some areas, which will need to be followed with policy,"" Motegi told reporters.
""We'll make sure that the domestic demand-led recovery continues. What is needed is supply-side reform. We'll focus our efforts on human resource investment, improvement in productivity, and new growth strategies.""
While growth was faster than expected, it is not expected to nudge the Bank of Japan into dismantling its massive stimulus program any time soon, as inflation remains stubbornly weak.
External demand subtracted 0.3 percentage point from GDP growth in April-June in part due to an increase in imports. This is notable because Japan usually relies on exports to drive growth.
Since launching quantitative easing in April 2013, the BOJ has pushed back the timing for reaching its 2 percent inflation target six times due in part to weak consumer spending.

The GDP data for April-June show private consumption is finally starting to move in the direction that the BOJ and other government ministers have long predicted.

Factory output fell most in Ireland and Malta, while the euro zone's two largest economies, Germany and France also showed a decline. Italy and the Netherlands showed an increase in monthly output, however.
Overall, industrial production in the euro area fell by 0.6 percent in June but still increased by 2.6 percent on an annual basis, staying below the 0.5 percent drop forecast in a Reuters poll of 32 economists.
After a 2.2 percent monthly rise in May, the production of capital goods, such as machinery, fell by 1.9 percent. The output of durable consumer goods declined 1.2 percent in June following a 1.4 percent rise in May.
For May, Eurostat revised its overall estimates downwards by 10 basis points, to 1.2 percent for the monthly and 3.9 percent for the annual reading.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2017 12:34AM ET</span>",Robust China economic growth shows signs of fading in July,"By Elias Glenn and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's strong economic growth showed visible signs of fading in July as lending costs rose and the gravity-defying property market cooled, though activity levels generally remained solid, propped up by a year-long construction spree.
Industrial output, investment, retail sales and trade all grew less than expected last month, after the world's second-largest economy put in a surprisingly strong showing in the first half, adding fuel to a global recovery.
But economists do not expect any hard landing, with the government keen to ensure stability ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party leadership reshuffle in the autumn.
""The upshot is that both foreign and domestic demand appear to have softened at the start of the third quarter,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. 
""A few sectors, such as steel, seem to have defied this slowdown in economic activity. But the strength in these areas likely won't last given that policy tightening is set to further weigh on infrastructure and property investment in coming months."" 
Factory output rose 6.4 percent in July from a year earlier, the slowest pace since January, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted output would grow 7.2 percent, down from a better-than-expected 7.6 percent in June. 
Despite the softer-than-expected reading, manufacturing activity still appears to be supported for now by an extended infrastructure boom. Beijing has been pouring money into road and rail projects that have fueled demand for products from construction equipment to glass and steel.
Indeed, China's steel output rose to a monthly record in July, while power generation was the highest since at least May 2014. 
Any sharp drop in industrial activity, which appears to be unlikely at this stage, would be a concern for policymakers as it risks rippling across the broader economy.
PROPERTY MEASURES BITING HARDER?
In a sign that economic momentum could slow further, fixed-asset investment grew 8.3 percent in the first seven months of the year, cooling from 8.6 percent in the first half of the year. Analysts had expected the pace to remain steady.
Property investment, in particular, showed signs of fatigue after local governments were forced into repeated rounds of cooling measures to curb soaring home prices. 
Growth in property investment, which mainly focuses on residential real estate but includes commercial and office space, eased to 4.8 percent in July from a year earlier, versus 7.9 percent in June, Reuters calculations based on official data showed.
New construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developers' confidence, contracted for the first time since last September, falling 7 percent in July on-year.
The statistic bureau said the overheated property market has cooled ""somewhat"", but it still expected China's economic performance to be steady in the second half.
The performance in July was stable, the bureau said.
Growth of private investment also ebbed to 6.9 percent in the first seven months of the year, suggesting small and medium-sized firms still face challenges in accessing financing. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
Retail sales pulled back, too, but growth remained in the double-digits for the fifth month in a row, suggesting consumption will continue to overtake factory output and investment as the biggest growth driver of the economy, a key policy goal for Beijing.
Retail sales expanded 10.4 percent in July on-year, down from June's 11 percent and forecasts for a 10.8 percent rise. But while car sales remained solid, automakers cut back production.
Concerns about the outlook for domestic demand resurfaced last week after Beijing reported weaker-than-expected import and export data.
Though some economists chalked up softer imports to seasonal or one-off factors such as bad weather, others said it may be a sign that China's trade growth peaked in the second quarter and is now on a downward trend.
Beijing is targeting growth of around 9 percent in fixed asset investment for 2017, and expects retail sales to increase about 10 percent. 
""Combined with the previously released data on trade, demand and production in July visibly slowed in July,"" said Li Qilin, an analyst with Minsheng Securities.
""As for the property market, it will continue to face downward pressure as projects are completed, with September and November key months to watch.""
HAS CHINA'S GROWTH PEAKED?
China has surprised most pundits this year, with the economy growing a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half, turbo-charged by heavy government spending, a hot housing market and record bank lending last year that has added to a rapid-build-up in debt.
That momentum should ensure the government handily meets its full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent.
Analysts have insisted that cracks will appear eventually, leading to a modest slowdown, but have repeatedly pushed back the timing in the face of resilient data.
A government crackdown on riskier types of lending has driven a slowdown in credit growth and pushed up financing costs, which are expected to weigh on businesses.
Average lending rates edged up to 5.67 percent in June from 5.53 percent in March, China's central bank said on Friday in its second-quarter policy report, adding it will continue working to fend off risks to the financial system. (For highlights of the PBOC's report, see
A revival in exports from China and other Asian economies may also be under a cloud.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Monday to turn up pressure on Beijing and order an investigation into some of its trade practices, though that does not necessarily signal any concrete action anytime soon.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",India's July retail inflation seen picking up for first time in four months,"By Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's consumer inflation is expected to have picked up in July after easing for three straight months, with food prices back on the rise, but is expected to remain well below the central bank's target. 
The consumer price index, the main policy target of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), likely rose 1.87 percent in July from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of economists, compared with an increase of 1.54 percent in June. 
The wholesale price index  likely rose 1.3 percent in July, after four months of easing. In June, WPI rose 0.9 percent. 
The wholesale price data will be released around 0630 GMT on Monday, followed by consumer prices  around 1200 GMT. 
Bountiful monsoon rains this year are expected to lead to another bumper harvest, further dampening food prices, which contribute near 50 percent of the consumer price index. 
Retail food prices had contracted for two months through June from a year earlier. 
RBI UNDER PRESSURE
Disinflationary pressures allowed the RBI to cut its main policy rate early this month by 25 basis points to 6 percent, the lowest since November 2010.
It was the first easing by an Asian central bank this year. But the RBI retained its ""neutral stance"" and warned inflation could pick up again.
The RBI expects retail inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in October-December..
The government called on Friday for more rate cuts as it flagged risks to economic growth and budget targets.
In his mid-year economic survey, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said there were downside risks to the official growth forecast of 6.75-7.5 percent for the fiscal year to March 2018.
India's industrial output  unexpectedly contracted 0.1 percent in June from a year earlier, data showed on Friday. 
The launch of a national Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July has caused chaos on the ground as complex rules have left companies confused on how to price their products.
Combined factory and service sector activity slumped in July to the lowest since March 2009, according to one private survey, though analysts believe the disruptions from the new tax will start to moderate soon and longer-term it will boost domestic trade.
Economists still expect the RBI could cut policy rates by 25-50 basis points this year.

In his report, Subramanian said there was a considerable scope for monetary easing as the inflation was undergoing a ""structural shift.""

150,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","UK employers see measly pay growth ahead, companies turn gloomy","By Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - British employers expect to raise pay only minimally over the next 12 months despite hiring more staff, a survey showed, suggesting the Bank of England is unlikely to come under much pressure to raise interest rates from their record low.
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said employers predicted their pay increases would average 1 percent despite more of them expecting to increase staff levels than in its previous survey three months ago.
""Predictions of pay growth increasing alongside strong employment growth is the dog that hasn't barked for some time now,"" said Gerwyn Davies, CIPD's senior labor market analyst.
While private-sector employers expect to raise pay by an average 2 percent, the median pay rise was dragged down by public-sector employers and charities which plan to offer pay rises of 1 percent and 1.4 percent respectively.
The BoE is watching pay closely as it gauges whether to raise rates. It had expected wages to start rising more quickly as employment picked up, but this has failed to materialize despite a record-high number of people in work.
Pay increases of 1 percent would lag further behind inflation which is likely to rise to around 3 percent later this year, tightening the squeeze on household budgets.
The CIPD said the weak outlook for pay was partly due to increases in migration from the European Union and the number of people looking for work over the past year.
Respondents also cited uncertainty over Brexit, a higher minimum wage and costs related to the introduction of automatic pension enrolment as weighing on their pay decisions.
The CIPD also said employers became more pessimistic over the past six months as the economy slowed.
This chimed with a survey published on Monday by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which found business confidence reversed the gains it made in the second quarter of the year as companies worried about the lack of clarity about Britain's exit from the EU.
The ICAEW's index fell from a reading of 6.7 for April to June, to -8 for the three months from July - similar to the levels seen at the start of the year.
Matthew Rideout, ICAEW's director of business, said this was due to the uncertainty around Brexit and the outcome of June's national election when Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority.
""Businesses cannot see through this haze of uncertainty and are struggling to look further than the end of the next quarter in terms of their decision making,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose slightly in July as higher food costs were partly offset by falling prices for a range of other goods, suggesting benign inflation that could persuade a cautious Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until December.
But with the labor market near full employment and economic growth accelerating, analysts expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start unwinding its massive bond portfolio at its policy meeting next month.
""We believe the Fed will focus on the balance sheet in September, foregoing another rate hike until December,"" said James Bohnaker, an economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""The inflation outlook will not change drastically anytime soon.""
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in June. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent in June.
Economists had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent in July and climbing 1.8 percent year-on-year.
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent for the fourth straight month. The so-called core CPI rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through July and has now increased by that margin for three consecutive months.
Despite the modest gain in consumer prices, which came on the heels of a drop in producer prices in July, many economists continue to share the Fed's conviction that transitory factors were holding back inflation.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last month that ""some special factors,"" including prices for mobile phone plans and prescription drugs, were partly responsible for the low inflation readings. Mobile phone prices continued to decline in July, falling 0.3 percent.
Prices of U.S. government debt initially rose on the inflation data, but pared gains after Russian Foreign Minster Sergei Lavrov said there was a Russian-Chinese plan to defuse tensions between the United States and North Korea.
The dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks rose.
FED'S CONUNDRUM
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure that has been stuck at 1.5 percent since May.
Inflation remains tame despite a tightening labor market, a conundrum for the central bank as it contemplates tightening monetary policy further.
The Fed is expected to outline a program to start offloading its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
It is expected to raise interest rates in December, though such a move would depend on future inflation data. The Fed has raised borrowing costs twice this year.
""One-time factors that have slowed inflation will gradually dissipate,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh. ""Stronger wage growth as businesses compete for scarce workers will also contribute to higher inflation in the second half of this year and in 2018.""
Food prices rose 0.2 percent last month, driven by a surge in the cost of meat, fish, eggs, fruits and vegetables. Food prices were unchanged in June. The cost of food consumed at home increased 0.2 percent.
Consumers also paid more for prescription drugs, whose prices jumped 1.3 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in June. Prices for apparel rose 0.3 percent after four straight monthly declines. While gasoline prices were unchanged after tumbling 2.8 percent in June, electricity prices rose 0.4 percent.
Rental costs maintained their upward trend last month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after advancing by the same margin in June.
The cost of new motor vehicles fell 0.5 percent, the biggest drop since August 2009 and the sixth consecutive monthly decline, amid slumping demand.
Low inflation is a relief for many Americans who have seen their paychecks barely increase in recent years. In another report, the Labor Department said inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings increased 0.7 percent in the 12 months through July, slowing from June's 0.9 percent gain.

""The Fed may want inflation to pick up, but that would not be good news to households,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The only way spending power has increased at all is that inflation has remained below the Fed's target rate.""

In a report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said that consumer prices rose 0.1% in July from a month earlier, compared to forecasts for 0.2% increase and a 0.1% gain in the prior month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 1.7% last month, below forecasts for a 1.8% increase although slightly higher the 1.6% advance seen in June.

Core CPI increased at an annualized rate of 1.7% in July, in line with consensus and the previous month’s increase.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2017 07:05AM ET</span>",France private sector job growth increased by 0.5 percent in second quarter,"PARIS (Reuters) - French private sector job growth grew at its fastest rate in least six years in the second quarter of the year, adding 91,700 jobs, data from the INSEE statistics agency showed on Friday.
The new jobs represented a 0.5 percent increase on the previous quarter, bringing the overall level to 19.21 million. The April-June period marked the 11th straight quarter of net new job creation in the private sector.
The steady creation of new jobs is gradually helping heal France's labor market, which saw huge job losses after the 2008 global financial crisis. They pick up has also been giving President Emmanuel Macron a tailwind as his government pushes through reforms to ease labor regulations.
But accelerating job creation has not yet been sufficient to bring unemployment substantially lower, partly because the number of people in the jobs market has also been rising.
Private sector job growth accelerated to 0.7 percent in the services sector, accounting for the large majority of new jobs, and by 0.4 percent in the construction industry, while remaining flat in the manufacturing sector.
Philippe Waechter, director of economic research at Natixis Asset Management, said that while the jobs figures marked another good set of data both for France and the broader euro zone, French labor reforms remained necessary.
Waechter said such reforms were needed to ensure that employment growth could be maintained even if there was a downturn in the global economy.
""If the French economy could rapidly create jobs even when there is a downturn in the cycle, especially in sectors showing the strongest growth, then this would strengthen its ability to have some self-control over its own economic growth, which is what we are looking for,"" he wrote in a note.

Fiscal spending in July rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier while revenue increased 11.1 percent, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website on Friday.
July's growth rate dropped sharply from 19.1 percent in June, although revenue growth rose from 8.9 percent in that month, the ministry said.
The government attributed the slowdown in July spending mainly to significant expenditure earlier.
Government spending in the first seven months of the year rose 14.5 percent on year, while revenues increased 10 percent.
Government-led stimulus has been a major driver of economic growth over the past years in the world's second-largest economy, but the pump-priming has also been accompanied by runaway credit growth and created a mountain of debt.
But the government has kept its budget deficit at 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2017, the same as last year, and pledged to clamp down on risks associated with local government debt.

The Chinese economy has defied expectations for a slowdown and expanded at a solid pace in the first half supported by construction projects, though the broad consensus is for growth to cool slightly in the coming quarters as the authorities continue to crack down on financial risks.

The deficit of $43 billion last month compared to a deficit of $113 billion in the year-earlier period, the Treasury Department said in its monthly budget statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury reporting a $73 billion deficit last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $93 billion on an adjusted basis compared with a $113 billion deficit in the same period of fiscal 2016.
The deficit for the fiscal year to date was $566 billion compared to $512 billion in July 2016. On an adjusted basis, the fiscal-year-to-date deficit was $611 billion last month versus $512 billion in the year-earlier period.
Receipts last month totaled $232 billion, up 10 percent from a year ago, while outlays were $275 billion, a decrease of 15 percent from the same month a year earlier.

The U.S. government is bumping up against its debt limit, with the possibility that it will be unable to pay all its bills in October unless Congress approves an increase in its borrowing capacity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in July, recording their biggest drop in nearly a year and pointing to a further moderation in inflation that could delay a Federal Reserve interest rate hike.
Other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. The trend in weekly jobless claims, however, remained consistent with a tightening labor market.
""Another twist of the screw tighter for this labor market but inflation is not able to gain a foothold in this economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The pot is on the stove boiling but no inflation steam is coming out.""
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1 percent last month, weighed by decreasing costs for services. That was the largest decline since August 2016 and reversed June's 0.1 percent gain. 
In the 12 months through July, the PPI increased 1.9 percent after rising 2.0 percent in the year through June. Economists had forecast the PPI to tick up 0.1 percent last month and 2.2 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged last month. The so-called core PPI gained 0.2 percent in June. The core PPI increased 1.9 percent in the 12 months through July after advancing 2.0 percent in June. 
Though the correlation between the PPI and the consumer price index has weakened, last month's drop in producer prices could worry Fed officials who have long argued that the moderation in inflation was temporary.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last month that ""some special factors"" were partly responsible for the low inflation readings. Inflation, which has remained below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for five years, is being watched for clues on the timing of the next interest rate increase.
The Fed is expected to announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at a policymaking meeting next month. 
But low inflation, characterized by sluggish wage growth, suggests the central bank could delay raising rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
The government will release July's CPI report on Friday.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data and also benefited from safe-haven trades amid escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS RISE 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Aug. 5.
With the labor market near full employment, there is probably limited room for claims to continue declining. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 127 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The unemployment rate is 4.3 percent.
A tightening labor market and tepid inflation have put the Fed in a difficult position.
Last month, prices for services fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since February. That accounted for more than 80 percent of the decrease in the PPI. Services were undercut by a 0.5 percent drop in the index for final demand trade services.
Services, which had increased for four straight months, are volatile month-on-month.
""They have a large weight in the final-demand measure, but have little relationship to CPI services prices,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.3 percent after being unchanged in June. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index. 
Energy prices fell for a third straight month in July while the cost of food was unchanged after a 0.6 percent jump in June. 

Core goods prices fell 0.1 percent in July after eight straight months of gains.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Aug. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 240,000 in the latest week. With the labor market near full employment, there is probably limited room for claims to continue declining. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 127 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The unemployment rate is 4.3 percent.
Labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its policy meeting next month. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest level since May.
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs in July. The economy has added 1.29 million jobs this year. That has resulted in the unemployment rate dropping five-tenths of a percentage point.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell by16,000 to 1.95 million in the week ended July 29. The so-called continuing claims have now been below the 2 million mark for 17straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims edged up 500 to 1.97 million, still remaining below the 2 million mark for the 15th consecutive week.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices decreased 0.1% last month, missing the forecast for it to repeat a 0.1% gain.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 1.9% in July, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.2% and easing from the 2.0% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, also slipped 0.1% in July, missing forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior month’s 0.1% rise.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.8% last month, below forecasts for a 2.1% increase and the gain of 1.9% in June.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with weekly jobless claims, the dollar trimmed gains. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1738 from around 1.1726 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3001 from 1.2991 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 109.62 from 109.77 earlier.

The four-week moving average was 241,000, down 1,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",UK exports disappoint as economy limps to end of weak first half,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy put in a weak performance in June when declines in car manufacturing, construction and exports gave an uninspiring end to the weakest first half of any year since 2012.
A year after Britain voted for Brexit, there is still little sign that exporters have gained much by way of competitiveness from the fall in the value of the pound after referendum.
The Bank of England has said it is counting on a recovery in exports to help lift growth in the economy.
""This is a disappointing set of data for a country that has recently seen an 18 percent fall in the currency,"" said HSBC economist Elizabeth Martins.
Britain's goods trade deficit jumped to a nine-month high of 12.7 billion pounds ($16.5 billion) in June from 11.3 billion pounds in May, exceeding all forecasts in a Reuters poll, and the figures also showed the growing importance of exports to the European Union just as Britain is preparing to leave the bloc. 
The Office for National Statistics said nothing in Thursday's data pointed to a material change in its earlier estimate that the economy grew 0.3 percent in the three months to June after expanding just 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
Car production recorded its biggest quarterly fall since 2011 and construction declined by the most since 2012.
Rising inflation has weighed on consumer demand since the start of the year, and a separate survey on Thursday showed property valuers reported the weakest growth in house prices in over four years.
OIL SPIKE
A spike in oil production in June helped ensure the headline measure of industrial output exceeded forecasts, growing by 0.5 percent after flat-lining in May. But this reflected a lack of production interruptions in North Sea oilfields from seasonal maintenance, which is likely later in 2017 instead.
Industrial output contracted 0.4 percent on the quarter - in line with previous estimates - while construction declined by more than previously thought, driven 1.3 percent lower by less public sector, commercial and repair work.
Forecasters at Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimated that the data showed GDP growth in the three months to July slowed to 0.2 percent.
Thursday's trade data continued the sharp divergence between private-sector business surveys, where exporters have reported big increases in demand since last year's Brexit vote, and official figures which show much less of a pick-up.
Goods export volumes dropped by 4.9 percent on the month in June, their biggest fall in a year. Looking at the second quarter, exports were 5.0 percent higher than last year, but this was almost matched by a 4.8 percent rise in imports.
The figures highlighted Britain's reliance on EU markets, at a time when Brexit talks are bogged down on preliminary issues and have yet to discuss trade, less than two years before existing arrangements are due to end.
The EU is the destination of more than half of Britain's goods exports, and over the past year these exports to the EU have grown almost twice as fast as those heading elsewhere.
""Safeguarding the favorable terms of trade that UK firms currently enjoy with partners and markets in Europe and beyond must be a key priority,"" the British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said.
Much of the gain in exports reflected a stronger global economy, rather than a weaker currency - which raised manufacturers' costs for imported raw materials - and overall economic growth was likely to weaken, he added.
A Reuters poll on Thursday showed economists expected Britain to grow by 0.3 percent a quarter on average over the coming year, compared with 0.4 percent in the EU countries that use the euro.

In a report, the UK Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production registered no change in June from the prior month, in line with expectations and following a drop of 0.1% in the previous month which was revised upwards from a decline of 0.2%.
On an annualized basis, manufacturing production rose 0.6% in June, also matching forecasts and after increasing at a rate of 0.3% in the previous month, which was revised from an initial 0.4% gain.
The report also showed that industrial production advanced by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in June, compared to forecasts for a 0.1% increase and the 0.2% decline in the preceding month.
Year-on-year, industrial production unexpectedly rose by 0.3% in June, better than expectations for a 0.1% decline and following the 0.2% decrease registered a month earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports were expected to record an eighth straight month of growth in July, a Reuters poll found, suggesting robust offshore demand could underpin moderate economic recovery.
Exports are expected to have risen 13.6 percent in July from a year ago, accelerating from a 9.7 percent increase in June, the poll of 15 economists found.
Imports were seen likely to have grown 17.0 percent from a year earlier, up for a seventh straight month.
""The global economy is gradually gaining momentum, so exports could pick up the pace of growth,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Imports likely remained solid supported by domestic demand.""
Shipments of auto parts and electronic components appear to be contributing to export growth, while liquefied natural gas, coal and oil have likely boosted imports, analysts say.
The poll showed a trade surplus of 392.0 billion yen ($3.56 billion) was expected in July, after 439.9 billion yen in June, the poll showed.
The finance ministry will announce the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday.) 
A separate Reuters' poll showed Japan's gross domestic product (GDP), due on Monday, is expected to have grown for a sixth straight quarter in April-June, buoyed by private consumption and capital investment.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2017 09:34PM ET</span>",Japan's June core machinery orders unexpectedly fall,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell for a third consecutive month in June, underscoring companies' reluctance to boost spending and conflicting with recent signs that the economic recovery is gathering momentum.
Core orders suffered a second straight quarter of declines in April-June, the first instance of consecutive quarterly falls since 2012. This casts doubt on policymakers' optimism that brightening business sentiment will drive up capital expenditure ahead.
While analysts warn against reading too much into the highly volatile series, the June fall offers a negative note ahead of Monday's second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data that is expected to show a solid growth recovery, driven by robust domestic demand.
Core orders, regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, decreased 1.9 percent in June from the previous month, confounding a median market forecast for a 3.7 percent increase, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
It followed a 3.6 percent tumble in May that prompted the government to cut its assessment on machinery orders.
Companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders would rise 7.0 pct in the July-September quarter.
""The third-quarter outlook for manufacturers' orders isn't bad,"" said a government official who briefed reporters on the data. ""Orders will likely be steady. But it's hard to see a large increase.""
Core orders fell 4.7 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, the biggest quarterly decline in a year. The first quarter had a 1.4 percent drop.
INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND
Some analysts say capital expenditure remains in an uptrend, citing infrastructure demand for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and the need for companies to spend on equipment to streamline operations amid intensifying labor shortages.
""Real interest rates are kept negative by the BOJ's monetary policy so funding constraints are small. There's no change to our view capital expenditure will increase in the medium-term,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Robust global demand has boosted Japanese business confidence to a three-year high in the there months to June, heightening policymakers' hopes that cautious companies will finally increase spending on plant and equipment.
A sustained economic recovery would help the Bank of Japan's efforts to stamp out persistent deflation, though wages and inflation remain stubbornly low despite recent signs of rebounding private consumption.
Japan's economy expanded an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports.
Data due on Monday is likely to show the economy grew for a sixth straight quarter in April-June, a Reuters poll showed, buoyed by robust consumer spending and corporate capital investment.

The machinery orders figures do not directly affect GDP data as the government uses other indicators to calculate the capital investment component of GDP.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>","U.S. productivity rises in second quarter, keeps labor costs in check","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. productivity grew more than expected in the second quarter as hours worked rose at their fastest pace in 1-1/2 years, leading to a modest increase in labor costs that could keep inflation muted in the near term. 
The trend in productivity, however, remains weak, suggesting robust economic growth will be hard to achieve. President Donald Trump has vowed to boost annual growth to 3 percent through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and regulatory rollbacks.
""The economy is aging and the growth rate for this eight-year expansion may have maxed out unless all the king's horses and all the king's men on Trump's economics team can get some of its tax reforms, tax cuts, and untangled regulatory reforms through a moribund Congress,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 0.9 percent annualized rate in the April-June period. First-quarter productivity was revised to show it edging up at a 0.1 percent pace instead of being unchanged as previously reported.
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, productivity increased at a 1.2 percent rate, the strongest performance in two years. Economists had forecast productivity increasing at a 0.7 percent pace in the second quarter.
With productivity rising, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at only a 0.6 percent pace in the second quarter after jumping at a 5.4 percent rate in the January-March period.
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, unit labor costs fell at a 0.2 percent rate. Coming on the heels of a recent moderation in inflation, the retreat in unit labor costs may worry Federal Reserve officials as they contemplate further monetary policy tightening.
""This recent softness in the data means that there could be less pressure for firms to pass higher costs on to consumers through price increases,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on rising tensions between the United States and North Korea. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose in a move to safe-haven assets, while stocks on Wall Street fell.
The dollar (DXY) was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies.
The government also revised productivity data going back to 2014, in line with recent revisions to gross domestic product figures. Those revisions showed productivity falling 0.1 percent in 2016, the first drop since 1982.
WORKER SHORTAGE
Productivity increased at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent from 2007 to 2016, below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016, indicating the economy's potential growth rate has declined.
""To reattain 3 percent real GDP growth with the demographics the U.S. is facing, productivity growth will have to exceed its long-run average growth rate of 2.1 percent, and we are far short of attaining such a pace,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Economists blame soft productivity on a shortage of workers as well as the impact of rampant drug addiction in some parts of the country. A report on Tuesday showed job openings surged to a record 6.2 million in June. 
The International Monetary Fund in June cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. economy to 2.1 percent for both 2017 and 2018. The IMF said the Trump administration was unlikely to achieve its 3 percent growth goal over a sustained period, partly because the labor market is at full employment. 
Other economists also argue that low capital expenditure, which they say has resulted in a sharp drop in the capital-to-labor ratio, is holding down productivity.
There is also a perception that productivity is being inaccurately measured, especially on the information technology side. Annual economic growth has not surpassed 3 percent or more since 2005. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.
Low productivity is constraining wage growth even as companies boost hiring to maintain output.
Hours worked rose at a rate of 2.5 percent in the April-June period, the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2015, and followed a 1.6 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. 

As a result, output per worker surged at a 3.4 percent rate, the fastest since the first quarter of 2015, after rising at a 1.8 percent pace at the start of the year.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index of overall mortgage activity rose 3.0 percent to 418.7 in the week ended Aug. 4.
MBA's seasonally adjusted barometer on refinancing requests increased 5.3 percent to 1,433.2 last week, raising its share of overall mortgage activity to 46.7 percent from 45.5 percent the prior week.
The group's seasonally adjusted gauge of home purchase applications, a proxy on future home sales, edged up 0.8 percent to 237.3 for last week. It hit a near 4-1/2 month low the previous week.
""The trend for purchase applications is still lower after an early-summer spike, but it looks like (refinancings) are slowly starting to pick themselves off the post-election lows logged in December,"" FTN Financial's manager of mortgage strategy Walt Schmidt wrote in a research note.
In late 2016, refinancing activity plummeted as mortgage rates surged to their highest in over two years. Home borrowing costs jumped in step with bond yields on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers would enact tax reform and other fiscal programs that would boost inflation.
Since then, mortgage rates have retreated with bond yields as Trump and Congress have not passed any fiscal measures.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slipped to 4.14 percent from 4.17 percent the previous.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average rates on other types of mortgages that the MBA tracks fell 1 to 5 basis points from the preceding week.

Auto inventories rose 1.4 percent after advancing 0.6 percent in May. The auto sector is struggling in the face of slowing demand, which has left manufacturers with an inventory glut.

Inventory investment had a neutral impact on the second quarter's 2.6 percent annualized growth pace after chopping off 1.46 percentage points from GDP at the start of the year.
Businesses have been carefully managing inventory amid sluggish domestic demand.
Sales at wholesalers increased 0.7 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in May. Sales of motor vehicles fell 0.5 percent after declining 0.6 percent in May.

Mexican consumer prices rose 6.44 percent in the year through July <MXCPIA=ECI>, the national statistics agency INEGI said on Wednesday, above the 6.37 percent rate forecast in a Reuters poll.
It was the highest reading since December 2008.
Mexico's central bank will release its next monetary policy decision on Thursday, with all analysts polled by Reuters expecting rates to remain steady at 7.00 percent.
The central bank has hiked interest rates in its previous seven meetings, taking the rate to a more than eight-year high.
In an interview with Reuters last month, Banco de Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens said it was likely the bank would pause its cycle of rate hikes in August.
A recovery in the Mexican peso this year has dampened concerns that currency weakness could fan inflation even higher.
Mexico's peso has rallied from a record low reached in January as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose big tariffs on imports from Mexico and moved toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The annual core rate <MXCCPI=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose to 4.94 percent, in line with the poll.

Consumer prices <MXINFL=ECI> rose 0.38 percent in July, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures, while the core index rose 0.27 percent during the month <MXCPIX=ECI>.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2017 02:22AM ET</span>","Steady China factory inflation a boon for industrial profits, economic growth","By Sue-Lin Wong and Min Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory price inflation held steady in July in a positive sign for industrial output and profits for the third quarter, even though a government-led drive to reduce debt is expected to cool earnings and economic growth by year-end.
China's economy has expanded solidly this year as commodity prices recovered, helping boost the industrial sector, while mild consumer price gains have left policymakers room to maneuver should growth falter.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 5.5 percent last month from a year earlier, unchanged from June, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer prices to hold steady for a third straight month at 5.5 percent.
Analysts say given expectations of deeper capacity cuts heading into the winter months, keeping supply tight and prices up, operating margins for businesses will probably remain solid in a boost to the bottom line. 
""We expect the PPI y/y to remain strong in the coming months, as the capacity reduction proceeds,"" said David Qu, markets economist at ANZ in a note to clients.
""The strong PPI indicates decent growth in corporate profits, especially for SOEs, leaving the authorities room for deleveraging,"" he said.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.2 percent in July, after three months in the red, with the NBS attributing this to a rise in prices of commodities including steel and non-ferrous metals.
Prices of commodities futures including steel rebar began to rise again in June and have continued to surge through early August, underscoring concerns over tight supply amid pollution inspections and strong restocking demand. 
China has eliminated around 120 million tonnes of low-grade steel capacity and 42.39 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in the first half of the year, equivalent to 84 percent of its target for the whole year.
Beijing has also ordered steel and aluminum producers in 28 cities to slash output during the winter heating season that starts in November to curb pollution, spurring local investors to anticipate gains for big producers when a shortfall bites.
Besides the capacity cuts, ""the strong pipeline of infrastructure investment will continue to underpin material prices in the coming months,"" ANZ's Qu said.
Shares in state-run Aluminium Corp of China (Chalco) have surged 63 percent since the start of July, while shares in Shenzhen-listed Yunnan Aluminium have rallied 67 percent.
TIGHTER CREDIT
Inflation has been sluggish in major economies including the United States, Europe and Japan despite brightening growth.
China's consumer price index slowed slightly to 1.4 percent in July from a year earlier, missing market expectations, pressured by a 1.1 percent annual fall in food prices. Analysts had predicted consumer inflation to have remained unchanged at 1.5 percent for the third month in a row.
""The current level of consumer inflation is so mild that the PBOC will be comfortable resuming the deleveraging process in the financial sector,"" Iris Pang, ING economist wrote in a note ahead of the data.
Chinese policymakers have clamped down on expansion of the money supply, and broad credit growth has also moderated, which could weigh on any further industrial recovery in China. 
The world's second-largest economy has defied expectations for a slowdown and expanded at a solid pace in the first half, as a government-led infrastructure push has kept construction humming, though the broad consensus is for growth to cool slightly in coming quarters as authorities continue to crackdown on financial risks.
Any weakness in factory price inflation could start to weigh on profits at China's large - and often heavily indebted - industrial firms, who have benefited from a strong commodities reflation cycle over the last year. 
While China's manufacturing sector has shown solid activity, a potential slowdown in profit growth would impact their ability to trim debt levels, which remain a concern for policy makers.
""We expect the central bank to keep liquidity either as tight as in July or even slightly tighter, and push interbank interest rates higher, especially at the short-end to reduce leveraging activities by interbank participants, which include banks and non-bank financial institutions,"" ING's Pang said. 
China has set its inflation target at 3 percent and economic growth of around 6.5 this year, which suggests policy makers still have room to tighten controls to rein in financial risks from years of debt-fueled stimulus.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian consumer prices likely rose in July, snapping back after a period of deflation in June thanks to a fuel tax hike and higher power prices, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Tuesday.
Still, annual inflation probably slipped to its lowest rate in 18 years, keeping the central bank on track to continue cutting interest rates aggressively.
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.19 percent in July from the month before, compared to a 0.23 percent drop in June, according to the median of 25 estimates in the poll. They ranged from a fall of 0.20 percent to an increase of 0.65 percent. 
Inflationary pressure is expected to remain through August due to the impact of a temporary hike in energy rates, which was pushed through by regulators to make up for a rainfall-related drag on hydropower output. The effect of a mid-July increase in the so-called PIS/Cofins social contribution tax on fuels should also linger in the short term.
But economists widely expect annual inflation to remain subdued due to a weaker-than-expected economic recovery. The central bank has cut interest rates by 500 basis points since October 2016.
Annual inflation is seen slowing to 2.66 percent in July, far below the bottom end of the government's target range of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, the survey showed. 
Statistics agency IBGE will publish the July inflation rate on Wednesday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT).
The pickup in inflation ""is a transitory effect and will likely not factor in the central bank's rate decision,"" said Leonardo Costa, economist at Rosenberg Associados consultancy. Rosenberg Associados is the third most accurate inflation forecaster in the Reuters poll. 

Interest rate future contracts indicate traders expect the central bank to reduce the benchmark Selic rate once again at its September meeting, though bets are split on the magnitude of the cut.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2017 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings at record high; labor market tightening,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings jumped to a record high in June, outpacing hiring, the latest indication that companies are having trouble finding qualified workers.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday also underscored labor market strength that will likely encourage the Federal Reserve to continue tightening monetary policy despite benign inflation and concerns about consumer spending.
""Companies are running out of workers to hire to do the job or even train to do the work, and this is a ticking time bomb for economic growth,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Today's JOLTS data bring a September meeting balance sheet unwind announcement a little closer to reality."" 
JOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September. 
Tame inflation and worries about consumer spending amid tepid wage growth and faltering motor vehicle sales, however, suggest the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 461,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million. That was the highest level since the data series started in December 2000 and pushed the job openings rate up two-tenths of a percentage point to a near one-year high of 4.0 percent. 
The monthly increase in job openings was the largest since July 2015. The surge in job openings was almost broad-based.
There were 179,000 additional vacancies in the professional and business services industries. The health care and social assistance sector had 125,000 more job openings and construction companies had an additional 62,000 unfilled positions. In June, job openings were concentrated in the Midwest and West regions. 
SKILLS MISMATCH
The ratio of job openings to unemployment hit a 16-year high. Hiring was little changed at 5.4 million in June, leaving the hiring rate steady at 3.7 percent. 
The gap between job openings and hiring points to a skills mismatch, which was also corroborated by a separate report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business.
The NFIB survey showed job openings at a 16-year high in July. Small businesses cited a lack of skills as the main reason for the vacancies. Others also blamed ""unreasonable"" wage expectations, attitude, appearance as well as drug addiction for disqualification of job seekers.
Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth. Annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent, contributing to inflation persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target.
""The JOLTS report continues what has been a reasonably strong run for the labor market data, and we expect continued improvement in the job market to keep upward pressure on wages,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Other details of the JOLTS report were mixed. About 3.1 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in June, down from 3.2 million in May. As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in May.
Layoffs rose 28,000 to 1.7 million in June, lifting the layoffs rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent.

""Layoff rates are historically low. But the recent increase may be worth watching,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed in San Francisco.

In the release of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, settled at 6.163 million in June from 5.702 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.666 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to increase to 5.775 million at the end of the second quarter from May’s initial reading.
The report has garnered more attention despite the lag on the data, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has cited the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.
Following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1809 from around 1.1808 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.2998 compared to 1.3006 previously, while USD/JPY was at 110.40 from 110.34 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 93.24, compared to 93.22 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets traded lower after the open. The Dow 30 slipped 12 points, or 0.05%, the S&P 500 lost 3 points, or 0.13%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 9 points, or 0.13%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,267.02 a troy ounce, compared to $1,268.53 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $49.05 a barrel from $49.09 earlier."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German trade activity slowed abruptly in June, adding to signs that demand in leading economies may be starting to flag just as central banks consider scaling back years of stimulus.
Exports from Europe's biggest economy fell by 2.8 percent, the biggest drop since August 2015 and one that ended five straight months of growth. Imports sank by 4.5 percent, the biggest drop since January 2009, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Exports and imports in China, which along with Europe has been driving an increasing share of global growth this year, grew much less than expected in July, data from Beijing showed earlier on Tuesday.
Weaker import growth in the world's second-largest economy could be the first tangible sign of a long-expected slowdown there. ""We have to be cautious about the import outlook,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ in Hong Kong, while noting that bad weather may have been a factor.
The global growth equation has shifted with political ructions in Washington and beyond that have stymied stimulus policies being pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Meanwhile further rate hikes remain on the Federal Reserve's horizon as debates intensify among European Central Bank and Bank of Japan policymakers about whether to rein in their stimulus programs.
The German data, which contrasted with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.3 percent drop in exports and a 0.2 percent gain in imports, drove the country's seasonally adjusted trade surplus to a 10-month high.
That figure of 21.2 billion euros is likely to lead to pressure on the government in Berlin to boost spending on investments as a way to support the economic recovery in other countries - a call made by the International Monetary Fund last month.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 23.6 billion euros after a downwardly revised reading of 16.0 billion euros in May, unadjusted data showed.
ECONOMIC STABILITY
Chancellor Angela Merkel, expected to win a fourth term in a national election next month, is campaigning on a platform of economic stability, and her conservatives promised tax cuts worth some 15 billion euros annually as well as increased spending on infrastructure, defense and security. 
The government expects the economy to grow 1.5 percent this year, down from 1.9 percent in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.
Construction and state spending have already, along with consumption, provided most of the growth impulse, supported by the low interest rate environment created by the ECB.
""Even though this morning’s trade data add to a disappointing month for German industry, we don’t think that the German economy has suddenly passed its peak,"" ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""Instead, strong confidence indicators point to a continuation of the recovery. Also, some kind of investment boost after the elections combined with the gradual recovery of private investment already this year should extend an already mature business cycle of the German economy well into 2018."" 
The Ifo institute said on Tuesday it expected the economy to grow 0.8 percent in the second quarter.

Industrial orders rose twice as much as expected in June, supported by strong domestic demand, and while industrial output fell in June, they grew in the second quarter overall.

(Reuters) - A measure of U.S. small-business confidence rose in July, boosted by strong hiring and an improving economic outlook, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report released on Tuesday.
The group's Index of Small Business Optimism <USOPIN=ECI> rose to 105.2 from 103.6 in June. The rise was the index's first since January.
Business owners signaled optimism in their ability to expand partly due to a pick-up in consumer spending. It follows solid hiring activity among small businesses in July as reported by the group last week, and rosy jobs data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.
""Strong consumer demand is boosting small business optimism,"" Juanita Duggan, president of NFIB, said in a release. ""Small business owners are feeling better about the economy because their customers are feeling better about the economy.""
The share of U.S. small business owners with plans to add to payrolls in July exceeded those planning to cut jobs by 19 percentage points on a seasonally adjusted basis, NFIB data showed. That is a 4-point increase from June and the strongest reading since December 1999.
Moreover, 60 percent of owners said they were hiring or trying to hire, a 6-point increase from June.
Yet when it came to filling those positions, 87 percent of small businesses said they were having a difficult time finding qualified workers.

Though optimism remained high, small businesses also showed little enthusiasm for laying out capital expenditure plans, a sign that businesses are still waiting to see what business-friendly policies come out of Washington, Duggan said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports grew much less than expected in July, raising concerns over whether global demand is starting to cool even as major Western central banks consider scaling back years of massive stimulus support.
China and Europe have been driving an increasing share of global growth this year as political conflict stymies stimulus policies being pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
But while China's overall trade continued to grow at a healthy clip in July, at 8.8 percent it was the slowest rate this year.
Some analysts chalked up the softer readings to seasonal or one-off factors, but others said weaker import growth could be the first tangible sign of a long-expected slowdown in the world's second-largest economy after a surprisingly strong first half. 
""External demand is not really worrying in terms of the outlook,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ in Hong Kong. 
""But we have to be cautious about the import outlook,"" said Yeung, while noting that bad weather may have been a factor.
China's export growth slowed to 7.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the weakest pace since February and cooling from an 11.3 percent rise in June, official data showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a 10.9 percent gain.
By contrast, neighboring South Korea saw its export growth accelerate in July while Taiwan's held roughly steady.
China's imports rose 11.0 percent, the slowest growth since December and down from a 17.2 percent rise in the previous month. That also missed expectations of 16.6 percent growth.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $46.74 billion for the month, the highest since January, compared with forecasts for $46.08 billion and June's $42.77 billion. The July trade figures are preliminary.
The disappointing China data came a day after ratings agency Fitch upgraded its outlook for the world economy for this year and next, citing recoveries in China and other emerging markets.
""Despite an uptick at the end of the second quarter, (China's) trade growth now appears to be on a downward trend. In particular, the sharp decline in import growth since the start of the year suggests that domestic demand is softening,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Improving global demand, particularly for electronics, has boosted exports for China and other trade-reliant Asian economies in recent months after several lean years of declining shipments.
But investors have been more focused on its strong appetite for imports, particularly industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal, which have sparked a global price rally and fueled higher earnings and share prices for many resource-related companies.
China's iron ore imports in July fell from 2.4 percent from a year earlier as a recent buying spree eased, even though higher steel prices and a year-long construction boom have spurred mills in the world's biggest steel producer to ramp up output.
Despite a sharp rebound in the value of the yuan versus the dollar in recent months -- the yuan has gained 3.5 percent so far this year -- analysts downplayed its impact on trade flows. 
In yuan terms, growth in exports and imports also downshifted markedly, to 11.2 and 14.7 percent, respectively. 
TRADE FRICTIONS 
Tuesday's data also showed China's exports to the United States rose 8.5 percent in July on-year, the slowest pace since February, while imports from the U.S. rose 24.2 percent. 
But that is unlikely to ease trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Korea's missile program.
China reported a trade surplus with the U.S. of $25.2 billion for July, down only slightly from June, which was a near two-year high.
For the first seven months of the year, China's trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, rose 5.9 percent to $142.75 billion, even as China's overall trade surplus has fallen. 
China may have more at stake than past years if relations with Washington sharply deteriorate.
Its surplus with the U.S. accounted for 61.5 percent of China's total trade surplus in the first seven months of the year, compared to just 44 percent in the year-ago period.
The United State and China failed last month to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade gap.
Trump had been expected to unveil new measures last week, as Washington prepares to launch an inquiry into Beijing's intellectual property and trade practices. But an announcement on Friday was postponed. 
The White House said on Saturday that Trump appreciated China's cooperation on new sanctions against North Korea that were passed over the weekend.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production unexpectedly fell for the first time this year in June, data showed on Monday, though it increased in the second quarter overall.
Output declined by 1.1 percent on the month after rising 1.2 percent in May, the Economy Ministry data showed. Expectations in a Reuters poll were for a 0.2 percent gain.
But factories and construction firms in Europe's largest economy produced 1.8 percent more in the April-June period than in the first quarter and the ministry said order levels, along with business climate indicators, pointed to the upward trend continuing.
""As unexpected as today's drop in industrial production has been, the German economy is still on track to post another strong quarter,"" said ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski.
But a scandal over diesel emissions and cartel allegations engulfing Germany's automobile industry could ultimately hurt the economy, he said, especially as cars make up around one fifth of German exports.
The output data followed a run of upbeat economic indicators, painting a rosy picture of the economy that is likely to boost Chancellor Angela Merkel's chances of winning a fourth term in a national election on Sept. 24.
Merkel's conservatives, holding a 15-point lead over their Social Democrat (SPD) rivals in the latest poll, are brandishing their economic credentials after 12 years in government during which Germany has prospered.
The conservatives are campaigning on a platform of economic stability and more new jobs, pledging to ensure full employment by 2025 while the SPD - currently the conservatives' junior coalition partner - is promising to invest more and ensure more social justice if it gets back into government.
Data published on Friday showed strong domestic demand pushed up industrial orders twice as much as expected in June, boding well for the sector's output in the coming months.
Other recent data has shown business morale at a record high, unemployment falling, engineering orders increasing, the manufacturing sector growing and consumer morale rising.
A breakdown of Monday's data showed energy output was the only bright spot in June, climbing by 1.4 percent, while manufacturers of intermediate, capital and consumer goods all churned out less than in May.
Separate data from the VDMA engineering association on Monday showed engineering firms had increased their output by 2.4 percent in price-adjusted terms in the first half of 2017 thanks to strong foreign demand.

The VDMA is expecting engineering output to climb by 3 percent this year, which would be the strongest increase since 2011.

But expectations fell to 16.0 points from 19.8 points in July in what the group called a worrying sign.

Overall consumer spending, the engine of the British economy, dropped by 0.8 percent in real terms last month compared with July 2016, payments company Visa said.
That was quicker than June's 0.2 percent fall, and following a further drop in May it marks the longest consecutive decline since February 2013, when a still-frail economy was struggling to recover from the financial crisis. 
""The figure provides further evidence that rising prices and stagnant wage growth are squeezing consumers' pockets,"" said Kevin Jenkins, Visa's managing director for the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Last week the Bank of England downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year and next, due partly to slower-than-expected wage rises, and it sees a weaker outlook for household spending than for other sectors of the economy.
Visa's data chimed with other signs that households are under financial pressure - from lackluster retail sales to falling new car registrations and mortgage approvals.
A fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote in June last year has stoked inflation at a time when wage growth is slowing, squeezing incomes. Consumer confidence dropped to a one-year low in July, according to market research firm GfK.
Spending on transport and communications and on clothing and footwear took the biggest knocks, down by 6.1 percent and 5.2 percent respectively. 
The fall in sales of clothing - a sector especially reliant on imports - was the second-biggest in five years, after an even larger drop in May.
Clothing sales had enjoyed a boost early in July due to better-than-usual summer weather, a survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed, but since then both the weather and the picture from other retail measures has been gloomier.
Visa pointed to continued strength in spending on hotels, restaurants and bars, as sterling's weakness deterred Britons from going abroad. 

""The sector is likely to have benefited from an early surge in summer staycations, as the weak pound made holidaying at home more attractive,"" Jenkins said.

The latest third-quarter gross domestic product estimate was weaker than the previous one for 4.0 percent growth, calculated on Thursday, the Atlanta Fed said.
Despite July's solid jobs data, the regional central bank's model scaled back its third-quarter projections on consumer spending growth to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent and on fixed investment growth to 4.1 percent from 5.2 percent.

Earlier Friday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired 209,000 workers last month, more than analysts had forecast, while average hourly earnings grew 0.3 percent, in line with expectations.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 09:38AM ET</span>","Canada trade deficit swells in June, but hiring continues in July","By Leah Schnurr
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade gap widened in June as a drop in energy shipments pulled exports back from a record high but sustained jobs growth in July was enough to keep expectations alive for yet another interest rate increase in the coming months.
Canada's trade gap was C$3.6 billion ($2.9 billion), Statistics Canada said on Friday, exceeding forecasts of a C$1.35 billion deficit. May's figures were revised to show a wider shortfall than initially reported.
Exports tumbled 4.3 percent, the largest decrease since February 2016 as both prices and volumes declined. The drop was widespread across categories, led by a decrease in metal products, and crude oil and bitumen.
The decrease in oil shipments led to a 4.5 percent decline in exports to the United States, Canada's largest trading partner. Canada's trade surplus with the United States shrank to C$2.17 billion, the smallest since June 2016.
Although the trade report was disappointing, economists said it was tempered by separate employment figures showing an increase of 10,900 jobs in July.
""The ongoing strength in the labor market suggests the Bank of Canada is on track to raise interest rates at least one more time this year, probably in October,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Canada's labor market has picked up in the past year, adding 387,600 jobs since last July, with 353,500 of those full-time positions.
The Bank of Canada raised rates last month for the first time in seven years amid the improving jobs picture and signs the economy has recovered from 2015's oil price shock.
The data saw markets slightly trim their bets for another hike, although traders are still pricing in 40 percent odds of an increase at the bank's next meeting in September.
Many economists think the appreciation in the Canadian dollar and weak inflation will prompt the central bank to wait until October to hike again. Market odds for an October move are at 66 percent.
The Canadian dollar added to declines against the greenback following the reports, as well as data that showed the United States created more jobs than expected last month.
Fewer people looking for work pushed the Canadian unemployment rate down to 6.3 percent, the lowest since October 2008 when the global financial crisis was taking hold.

July's job gains were driven by increased hiring in the services sector, with the trade industry adding 21,900 new jobs. Hiring was also seen in manufacturing and trade.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap decreased 5.9 percent to $43.6 billion, the lowest level since October 2016. May's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $46.4 billion from the previously reported $46.5 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall narrowing to $45.0 billion in June.
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit fell to $61.0 billion from $62.8 billion in May. Real goods exports surged to an all-time high of $126.9 billion in June, buoyed by record high petroleum exports.
The government reported last Friday that trade contributed almost two-tenths of a percentage point to the economy's 2.6 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter.
In June, exports of goods and services increased 1.2 percent to $194.4 billion, the highest level since December 2014. There were increases in exports of capital goods, food and motor vehicles. Exports to China fell 4.7 percent.
Imports of goods and services slipped 0.2 percent to $238.0 billion in June. There were decreases in imports of industrial supplies and materials. Imports of cell phones and other household goods fell $0.9 billion, accounting for the bulk of the $0.7 billion decrease in consumer goods imports.

Imports of goods from China increased 1.2 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased 3.1 percent to $32.6 billion in June.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 08:35AM ET</span>","U.S. payrolls increase more than expected, wages rise","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in July and raised their wages, signs of labor market tightness that likely clears the way for the Federal Reserve to announce next month a plan to start shrinking its massive bond portfolio.
The Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs last month amid broad gains. June's employment gain was revised up to 231,000 from the previously reported 222,000.
Average hourly earnings increased nine cents, or 0.3 percent, in July after rising 0.2 percent in June. That was the biggest increase in five months. Wages increased 2.5 percent in the 12 months to July, matching June's gain.
Average hourly earnings have been trending lower since surging 2.8 percent in February. Lack of strong wage growth is surprising given that the economy is near full employment, but July's monthly increase in earnings could offer some assurance to Fed officials that inflation will gradually rise to its 2 percent target.
Economists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September.
Sluggish wage growth and the accompanying benign inflation, however, suggest the U.S. central bank will delay raising interest rates again until December. The Fed has raised rates twice this year, and its benchmark overnight lending rate now stands in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 183,000 jobs in July and wages rising 0.3 percent.
Wage growth is crucial to sustaining the economic expansion after output increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, an acceleration from the January-March period's pedestrian 1.2 percent pace.
The unemployment rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.3 percent, matching a 16-year low touched in May. It has declined four-tenths of a percentage point this year and matches the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017. July's decline in the jobless rate came even as more people entered the labor force.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.
Still, some slack remains in the labor market, which is restraining wage growth. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 8.6 percent last month.
July's employment gains exceed the monthly average of 184,000 for this year. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
Republican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes, cutting regulation and boosting infrastructure spending.
But after six months in office, the Trump administration has failed to pass any economic legislation and has yet to articulate plans for tax reform and infrastructure spending as well as most of its planned regulatory roll-backs.
The jobs composition in July mirrored June's. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 16,000 jobs. Employment in the automobile sector rose by 1,600 despite slowing sales and bloated inventories that have forced manufacturers to cut back on production.
U.S. auto sales fell 6.1 percent in July from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.73 million units. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have both said they will cut production in the second half of the year.
Construction firms hired 6,000 workers last month. Retail payrolls increased by 900 in July as hiring by online retailers more than offset job losses at brick-and-mortar stores.
Companies like major online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are creating jobs at warehouses and distribution centers. Amazon this week held a series of job fairs to hire about 50,000 workers.

Government payrolls gained 4,000 in July.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 03:10AM ET</span>",Japan's GDP seen expanding for sixth straight quarter on domestic demand,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to grow for a sixth straight quarter in April-June, a Reuters poll found on Friday, buoyed by domestic demand as consumer spending recovered and firms increased their capital investment. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) was seen expanding at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter, the poll of 20 analysts found, a rate last posted in January-March 2016, while the last six straight quarter run of growth was January-March 2005 through April-June 2006.
The anticipated 2.5 percent expansion would translate to 0.6 percent on quarter-on-quarter growth after a revised 0.3 percent rise in the first quarter this year.
""The economy for this fiscal year will likely continue recovering, helped by the global economic recovery,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Consumer sentiment is improving on higher share prices and durable goods purchases are picking up, which likely contributed positively to consumer spending."" 
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, likely grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter, after a 0.3 percent gain in the January-March period.
External demand - or exports minus imports - was thought likely to shave 0.3 percentage point off growth, the poll found, which would be the first deduction for negative net exports in four quarters.
But analysts say the trend of exports remains upward on overseas demand while gains in imports reflected strong domestic demand. 
The poll found capital spending was to expected to show a rise of 1.2 percent in the second quarter after increasing 0.6 percent the previous quarter.
The Cabinet Office will announce the GDP data on August 14 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, August 13).
Japan will publish core machinery orders next week, which are seen likely to show a 3.7 percent increase in June from May when they dropped 3.6 percent, and up for the first time in three months. An outcome of 3.7 percent would mark the fastest rate of growth since July 2016. 
The core orders, which exclude ships and equipment for power generators, are a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months.
June was seen down 1.0 percent in from a year earlier following a 0.6 percent rise in May. 
""Machinery orders from the manufacturing sector have improved recently...The focus is whether orders from the non-manufacturing sector for labor-saving equipment will rise,"" an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities said in the survey. 
The Cabinet Office will issue the machinery orders report on August 10.
Japan's current account balance, due out on Tuesday, is expected to show a surplus of 814 billion yen ($7.40 billion) in June from 1.65 trillion yen in May, the poll showed.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 02:59AM ET</span>",Rise in industry orders suggests German industry to gain steam,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose twice as much as expected in June as a surge in domestic demand offset weaker foreign appetite, data showed on Friday, suggesting this sector of Europe's largest economy will gain traction in the coming months.
Factories posted a 1 percent increase in contracts in June after orders for German-made goods rose by an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in May, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That beat the Reuters forecast for a 0.5 percent rise.
""The order numbers are another mosaic tile in what is a very positive picture of the economy,"" said Nordea economist Holger Sandte.
A breakdown of the June data showed domestic demand increased by 5.1 percent while foreign orders dropped by 2 percent, with orders from the euro zone declining by 2.4 percent.
But foreign orders are generally outpacing domestic demand even though Friday's data showed the opposite, Sandte said.
""The stronger euro isn't likely to hamper this development much so the traffic lights for the economy are still glowing green,"" he added.
The orders data follows a flurry of upbeat figures that have underlined the strength of the German economy seven weeks before a national election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term.
'CLIMAX REACHED'
Recent data has shown the number of Germans out of work falling, engineering orders increasing, the manufacturing sector growing and consumer morale rising, though private sector growth has slowed.
Merkel's conservatives, who have presided over a period of economic prosperity in Germany for much of the last 12 years, have made the country's rude economic health a pillar of their campaign, promising ""a strong economy and secure jobs"".
The Economy Ministry said order levels, combined with an excellent business climate, pointed to a continued slight upturn in industrial activity.
But Sal. Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens warned that while the economic upturn was likely to continue in Germany, it was unlikely to maintain current growth rates.
""The economic climax will probably have been reached in the second quarter,"" she said.
The government has forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.5 percent this year -- below the 1.9 percent expansion seen in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.
Factories making consumer goods and manufacturers of intermediate goods both registered strong order increases but bookings for capital goods declined as robust domestic demand was unable to offset a fall in foreign orders.

Quarterly data was also strong, with order levels in the April-June period coming in 0.8 percent above first-quarter levels as bookings climbed two months in a row after falling in April, the Economy Ministry said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 12:30AM ET</span>",Australia's central bank upbeat on economy as consumers splurge,"By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is more confident that economic growth will accelerate over the next two years but expects little improvement in unemployment or wage growth, suggesting official interest rates are on hold for some time.
In its 66-page statement on monetary policy on Friday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) forecast the A$1.7 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy will grow ""above potential"" at around 3 percent over the next couple of years.
Supporting the RBA's upbeat view, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed retailers enjoyed sales growth of 1.5 percent in April to June, their best quarter in four years.
That means growth in broader consumer spending almost certainly rebounded from the first quarter's tepid 0.5 percent.
""Overall this is a significant upside surprise,"" said Westpac economist Matthew Hassan.
""Although the retail survey is a partial measure that does not always map to the quarterly consumption figures in the national accounts, the jump from a flat first quarter to strong second quarter is a clear positive signal.""
Adding to evidence domestic consumption picked up, new vehicle sales rose to a record in July for a third straight month.
There are some signs of life in the labor market too.
Since the start of the year, around 165,000 full-time jobs were created while average hours worked and labor force participation have both risen.
Corporate profits are surging while measures of business confidence and conditions are the strongest since 2008.
Encouraging the RBA is a broad-based pick up in global growth since the start of this year, while the price of Australia's single biggest export earner - iron ore - has been climbing, boosting the country's terms of trade.
Indeed, the country has run trade surpluses in seven of the last eight months.
""GDP growth looks to have recovered in the June quarter,"" the RBA said. ""Further out, GDP growth should continue to recover as the drag from falling mining investment comes to an end and the ramp-up in resource exports continues.""
ALL WORK, NO PAY
Still, the RBA forecast little improvement in unemployment, with the jobless rate seen at just under 5.5 percent out to the end of 2019 from 5.6 percent now.
Underemployment - which measures people wanting to work more hours - is already near record highs.
That spare capacity will likely keep wages growth and inflation subdued, especially when households are saddled with a mountain of debt. The household debt-to-income ratio is at a record high 190 percent and rising faster than incomes.
Core inflation - the main focus for policymakers - is only expected to reach the bottom end of the RBA's long-term target band of 2-3 percent later this year.
Inflation has remained below target since the start of 2016 and was the single biggest reason for the central bank to cut interest rates to an all-time low of 1.50 percent last year.
The bank noted utility prices were now set to rise more than first expected over the next few years, adding significantly to headline consumer prices.
The bank also cautioned against further gains in the Australian dollar, which has soared nearly 7 percent since June to close to 80 U.S. cents.
""Further exchange rate appreciation would tend to generate a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast,"" said Lowe.

(Reuters) - Job creation among small businesses picked up in July as strong economic growth in the United States and abroad gave confidence to small business owners, a National Federation of Independent Business report showed on Thursday.
The percentage of U.S. small business owners saying they planned to add to payrolls in July exceeded those with plans to cut jobs by 19 percentage points on a seasonally adjusted basis, the NFIB data showed. That is a 4-point increase from June and the strongest reading since December 1999.
""Small business owners are investing their money in new jobs and we know small business is where the jobs are,"" said Juanita Duggan, president and chief executive officer of NFIB in a release.
Moreover, 60 percent of owners said they were hiring or trying to hire, a 6-point increase from June.
Although businesses were looking to expand, finding workers remains an issue. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for the positions they wanted to fill, according to the report.
Business owners said that their biggest difficulties in finding qualified workers stem from a skills mismatch, weak work history or unrealistic wage expectations.
""The tight labor market is driving up costs for small employers,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry.""
Job openings were most frequently reported in construction, manufacturing and non-professional services.
Around 35 percent of business owners said they could not fill jobs in July, a 5-point increase from the previous month and a 43-year record high on a quarterly basis.
The report comes a day ahead of the closely watched monthly payrolls survey from the U.S. Department of Labor. That benchmark reading of the job market is expected to show U.S. employers added 183,000 jobs in July, according to a Reuters poll, down from 222,000 reported in June. The unemployment rate is seen dropping to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 12:40PM ET</span>","Brexit-wary Bank of England leaves rates on hold, cuts growth forecast","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept interest rates at a record low again on Thursday and cut its forecasts for growth and wages as it warned that Brexit was weighing on the economy.
The gloomier outlook for the next two years further reduced speculation that the BoE was close to its first rate hike in a decade.
Governor Mark Carney nonetheless sought to keep alive the possibility of one next year. 
He said uncertainty about Brexit -- in particular lower investment by companies -- meant the economy could not grow as fast as before without pushing up inflation. So, just a small improvement in growth could bring forward a rate hike.
""The speed limit, if you will, of the economy has slowed,"" he told reporters. ""That ... could have consequences for monetary policy, depending on the evolution of demand.""
But investors saw no sign that the BoE was in a hurry to raise rates, a contrast to the outcome of its June meeting.
The pound hit a nine-month low against the euro and fell by more than a cent against the U.S. dollar. Shares rose and British government bond prices jumped. 
Bets on interest rate futures suggested investors had pushed back their expectation for the first BoE rate hike by four months to December next year, RBC Capital Markets said. 
Central banks around the world have struggled to wean their economies off the stimulus of rock-bottom interest rates, largely because of weak wage growth for workers. 
The BoE faces the extra challenge of Britain's leaving the European Union, and its uncertain impact on Britain's economy.
Carney said ""the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested"" and he said investment levels in 2020 were set to be 20 percentage points below a BoE forecast before the Brexit vote. 
His wary tone about Brexit prompted an angry response from a leading supporter of last year's Leave campaign. 
John Longworth, a former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the BoE was resorting to ""Project Fear"" again, referring to what Brexit supporters said was a campaign to scare voters away from voting to leave the EU. 
The Bank said it now expects the economy to grow by 1.7 percent this year, down from its May forecast of 1.9 percent and by 1.6 percent in 2018, down from 1.7 percent. It kept its 2019 forecast at 1.8 percent.
Faced with a weaker outlook, the BoE's rate-setters voted 6-2 to keep Bank Rate at 0.25 percent, in line with a Reuters poll of economists. That was more clear cut than a close 5-3 vote at the Monetary Policy Committee's meeting in June.
Since then one of the dissenters, Kristin Forbes, has left the central bank. Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty voted again for a 25 basis point rate rise. But BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane, who said in June that he was likely to back a rate hike in the second half of this year, stayed with the majority.
The Bank said it might raise borrowing costs a bit more than investors expect over the next three years.
But U.S. bank Citi said the BoE was probably more worried about the risks of a disorderly Brexit than it let show.
""Brexit downside risks are larger than the MPC can formally acknowledge, which keeps the bar for a pre-2019 rate hike high, in our view,"" analysts at the bank said in a note to clients.
The Bank kept its asset purchase programs unchanged on Thursday. It also said a bank lending scheme would end as on schedule in February 2018.
Analysts at HSBC predicted the 6-2 vote for keeping rates on hold would become 7-2 once when the finance ministry's top economist Dave Ramsden joins the MPC in September. He oversaw the ministry's pre-referendum forecasts about Brexit which warned of a hit to the economy from a Leave vote. 
BOE DILEMMA
The split on the MPC over what to do with rates highlights the challenge facing the central bank.
Britain avoided a recession after the Brexit vote in June 2016, inflation is running above the BoE's 2 percent target and unemployment is at a four-decade low.
At the same time, data has shown the economy had its slowest growth since 2012 in the first half of this year, inflation unexpectedly eased back in June and wage growth is weak.
A series of surveys of Britain's manufacturing, construction and services sectors published this week suggested the economy remained in a low gear in July.
Furthermore, Brexit talks between London and Brussels have made little progress, raising concerns that a messy departure from the bloc in 2019 could hammer the economy.
In response to the painfully slow rises this year, the Bank cut its forecasts for wage growth in 2018 and 2019 to 3 and 3.25 percent, down by half a percent for each year.
It blamed the downgrade on Britain's stubbornly weak productivity and in part on the Brexit uncertainty.
The BoE lowered by only a fraction its forecasts for inflation which it now saw at just under 2.6 percent in a year's time after peaking at around 3 percent in October. 
British inflation in June stood at 2.6 percent and the BoE's latest forecasts see it remaining above its 2 percent target throughout its three-year forecast period.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 12:37PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; services sector growth slowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to a tightening labor market that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to announce plans next month to start reducing its massive bond portfolio.
Labor market strength was also underscored by another report on Thursday showing U.S.-based employers last month announced the fewest job cuts in eight months. But a moderation in services sector activity to an 11-month low in July put a wrinkle in the brightening economic outlook.
The services sector accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy and analysts worry that the slowdown, if sustained, could keep inflation tame.
""The services economy is cooling, which makes the Fed's goal of 2 percent inflation a little harder to achieve,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But with the labor market tight, the Fed can continue mopping up the stimulus provided to fight the financial crisis and recession.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 240,000 for the week ended July29, the Labor Department said. Economists had forecast claims falling to 242,000.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 126 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 241,750 last week, the lowest level since May.
Economists believe that labor market tightness will encourage the Fed to announce a plan to start offloading its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September. 
The U.S. central bank is, however, expected to delay raising interest rates until December because of low inflation. The Fed has raised rates twice this year.
The claims data has no bearing on July's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 183,000 jobs last month after surging by 222,000 in June. The unemployment rate is seen falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.3 percent.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) initially firmed against a basket of currencies on the claims data but gave up gains after the services sector survey. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, buoyed in part by the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates at a record low and downgrade its economic and inflation forecasts.
U.S. stocks were mixed, with the S&P 500 <.SPX) and the Nasdaq (IXIC) falling, but the Dow (DJI) setting a new record high.
LAYOFFS DECLINE
In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced 28,307 job cuts last month, down 9 percent from June and the fewest number since November 2016.
Retailers planned to cut 3,862 jobs in July. They were closely followed by the healthcare products and services sector where employers planned 3,634 layoffs.
""While retailers are cutting the most jobs this year, those companies are also announcing the most hiring,"" said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""New retail jobs could be going to places like fulfillment and distribution centers.""
Retailers have accounted for 245,616 of the 556,493 new jobs that have been announced so far this year, according to Challenger tracking. Online retail giant Amazon (O:AMZN) plans to hire about 50,000 workers this month at its warehouses and sorting centers.
A third report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed its non-manufacturing index fell to a reading of 53.9 last month, the lowest since August 2016, from 57.4 in June. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in the services sector.
""The ISM report is clearly a big disappointment and suggests that the economy may have lost some momentum going into the third quarter,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics. ""But it is worth remembering that these monthly surveys have always been volatile.""
Last month, a gauge of new orders received by services industries fell to 55.1 from 60.5 in June. A measure of services sector employment dropped 2.2 points to 53.6. 

Nine industries reported increasing employment and four said they had cut payrolls. Some companies said they ""continued to refine workforce through efficiencies"" and others reported ""filling more open positions.""

Factory goods orders jumped 3.0 percent, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the largest gain since October 2016 and followed two straight monthly declines. May's data was revised to show orders falling 0.3 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent drop.
Economists had forecast that factory orders would surge 2.9 percent in June. Manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been buoyed by a surge in oil and gas drilling.
But the energy stimulus is easing as ample supplies restrain crude oil prices. At the same time, motor vehicle production is declining as the industry struggles with falling sales, which have created an inventory glut.
Motor vehicle production has decreased for three straight quarters. General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have both announced they will cut production during the second half of this year. U.S. auto sales fell 6.1 percent in July from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.73 million units.
Thursday's report from the Commerce Department also showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business spending plans - were unchanged in June instead of slipping 0.1 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 0.8 percent in May.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, edged up 0.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent gain.
In June, orders for machinery increased 0.4 percent after advancing 2.6 percent in May. Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders increased 3.8 percent after accelerating 10.3 percent in May.
Orders for transportation equipment jumped 19.0 percent, the biggest rise since July 2014, reflecting a 131.1 percent surge in civilian aircraft orders. Motor vehicle orders nudged up 0.1 percent after rising 0.3 percent in May.

Unfilled orders at factories increased 1.3 percent in June, the largest gain since July 2014. Manufacturing inventories rose 0.2 percent while shipments fell 0.2 percent. The inventories-to-shipments ratio rose to 1.38 from 1.37 in May.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 07:46AM ET</span>",U.S. planned layoffs fall; hiring picks up in July: Challenger,"By Kimberly Chin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. companies dropped in July to its lowest since November while job-opening announcements notched up, a sign that businesses are confident that the economy will continue to expand, a report released Thursday showed.
U.S. companies announced 28,307 planned job cuts in July, a 9 percent decline from 31,105 in June and the lowest since November, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
Overall, July's job cuts were down 37.6 percent from 45,346 a year earlier.
Meanwhile, employers made plans to hire 88,000 workers, the highest July total on record and the third-highest total of the year, according to the report.
""Maybe some of these hiring announcements are just some of the exuberance that comes late in an expansion,"" Challenger, Gray & Christmas Chief Executive Officer John Challenger said in an interview. ""But it may also be that some of the decision makers who decide whether to build a new plant or launch a new product or hire new people are becoming more comfortable that the recession is not imminent.""
Despite low unemployment, there is slack in the system, leaving ample opportunity for employers to pick up skilled workers, Challenger said. 
The so-called U6 unemployment rate, which measures the share of discouraged, part-time or underemployed workers in the economy, is at 8.6 percent, higher than the unemployment rate of 4.3 percent.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) led July's surge in hiring-plan announcements. 
Amazon announced intentions to hire 50,000 workers at its recruitment fair, while Foxconn said it would build a factory in Wisconsin and add 3,000 jobs in the next three years.
Although the retail sector has been the hardest-hit this year, there are signs it is crawling back. 

Through the first seven months of this year, retailers have said they would add 245,616 new positions, 44 percent of all new jobs announced in 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Businesses across the euro zone started the second half with robust growth, outpacing British counterparts which are struggling to regain momentum as consumers keep their hands in their pockets, surveys showed.
Signaling the bloc's positive readings could continue into August, new orders rose, backlogs of work were built up and firms increased headcount. But British services firms' expectations for the year ahead were among the weakest since late 2012.
""We are expecting growth to be a little stronger in the second half than in the first in the UK, whereas in the euro zone we are expecting it to be a little weaker,"" said Ben May at Oxford Economics.
""So they converge but there is a modest outperformance by the euro zone in the second half -- a relatively sustained period of outperformance which hasn't been particularly common over recent years.""
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 55.7 in July, down from June's 56.3 and a flash estimate of 55.8. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
The British version only nudged up to 54.1 from 53.8.
The latest PMI figures suggest the euro zone economy will grow 0.6 percent this quarter, IHS Markit said, whereas Britain is set for 0.3 percent growth. A Reuters poll last month had 0.4 and 0.3 percent forecasts respectively. 
Last quarter, the euro zone economy grew twice as fast as Britain's for the second consecutive quarter.
""Typically the UK economy tends to grow much more strongly than the euro zone, so this period of outperformance by the euro zone is reasonably unusual,"" May said.
The July surveys will bolster the case for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold later on Thursday while rising prices in the currency union could give the European Central Bank more grounds for tweaking its monetary policy in the autumn.
Improving economic growth in Europe and hints from ECB policymakers have helped shape expectations for a shift, probably in the form of an announcement it will taper its asset purchases, even though the inflation outlook doesn't point to a need for a change just yet.
In September, the ECB is expected to announce a move away from its ultra-easy policy, according to a Reuters poll.
By contrast, only two of the 80 economists polled by Reuters last month expect the BoE to tighten policy later on Thursday and medians in the survey suggest Bank Rate will be left at its record low 0.25 percent until 2019. 
""The (UK) services PMI remains consistent with sub-par growth, despite its modest improvement in July, suggesting that the economy still isn't strong enough to warrant higher interest rates,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Britons voted just over a year ago to leave the European Union and since then workers' pay increases have fallen further behind inflation, compelling shoppers to hold back on purchases.
Spending played a large part in Britain's economic growth last year and although a big fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has benefited manufacturing exporters, consumers have been hit by a bounce in prices of imported goods and services.
""According to IHS Markit, firms continue to cite Brexit uncertainty and the household spending squeeze as dampening factors when it comes to new orders and demand for their services,"" said James Smith at ING.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",Britain experiencing 'sluggish' economic growth right now: PMI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks set for ""steady but sluggish"" growth over the coming months, according to a closely watched survey that showed businesses in somber mood about their prospects ahead of Brexit.
The figures for the services sector added to signs that Britain's economy is struggling for momentum after its slowest start to the year since 2012, and bolster the case for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold later on Thursday.
Nonetheless, sterling edged up to an 11-month high against the U.S. dollar after the survey, which came in a little stronger than expected.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in July from June's four-month low of 53.4, slightly above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll but below its long-run average.
The services PMI follows more upbeat numbers on Tuesday from the much smaller manufacturing sector, and weak construction figures on Wednesday.
Taken together, the data suggest the economy is growing at a ""steady but sluggish"" quarterly rate of 0.3 percent, the same as in the three months to June, according to IHS Markit.
While manufacturing exporters have gained from the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote, Thursday's survey showed consumer-facing businesses have been hurt by a reduction in demand due to stretched household budgets.
""The services PMI remains consistent with sub-par growth, despite its modest improvement in July, suggesting that the economy still isn't strong enough to warrant higher interest rates,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The longer-term outlook is also weak, with service-sector firms' expectations for the year ahead stronger than in June but still among the weakest readings since late 2012.
""Firms' prospects for the coming year have slipped to a level which has previously been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting ... largely reflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and Brexit process,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist.
Three months ago the Bank of England predicted Britain's economy would grow by 1.9 percent this year, similar to 2016, but it is widely expected to downgrade this when it updates its forecasts later on Thursday.
Nonetheless, a rise in inflation to a near four-year high -- largely driven by the fall in the pound since last year's referendum -- has prompted a minority of BoE policymakers to call for a reversal of last year's cut in interest rates.
Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly failed to win an outright majority in a parliamentary election in June, and with less than two years before Britain leaves the European Union, her party has yet to agree a clear set of negotiating goals.
On Tuesday, Britain's biggest electrical retailer Dixons Carphone (L:DC) said the government was being insufficiently pragmatic and urgently needed to reach a deal with the EU on the future status of foreign workers in Britain.
IHS Markit said services companies hired staff last month at the fastest pace since January 2016 and that a number struggled to find suitably skilled staff.

Businesses' costs picked up by the most since March and they also raised prices by more than average, raising the chance that June's dip in consumer price inflation will prove temporary.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 05:30AM ET</span>",China to report strong July economic data; trade numbers could fuel friction with U.S.,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A flurry of data in coming weeks should show steady growth in China in July, though the potential for increased trade friction with the United States poses a risk to the world's second-largest economy as it navigates a tighter policy environment.
China is expected to report another strong month of exports in July, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, which could play into increasing rhetoric from Washington that China unfairly benefits in the trade relationship. 
China's exports are seen rising 10.9 percent year-on-year in July, according to a median estimate from a poll of analysts, which would be down only slightly from June's robust 11.3 percent growth, while imports are expected to increase 16.6 percent. 
China's trade surplus in July was tipped at $46.08 billion, which would be the second highest this year, though it had shrunk to $185 billion in the first half of this year from $257.1 billion in the same period in 2016 as imports picked up. 
But the surplus with the United States, China's largest export market, actually rose 6.5 percent in the first half to $117.5 billion, giving grist to U.S. President Donald Trump's frequent arguments that the trade balance between the two nation hurts the U.S. economy. 
Indeed, American appetite for Chinese goods appear to have only increased over the years. The surplus with the U.S. accounted for 64 percent of China's total surplus in the first half, compared to 43 percent in the year-ago period, according to China customs data. 
U.S.-CHINA TRADE TENSIONS 
The issue has resurfaced over the past week as a bipartisan chorus has risen urging Trump to stand up to China as he prepares to launch an inquiry into Beijing's intellectual property and trade practices in coming days.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Korea's missile program.
Trump tweeted on Saturday after the latest North Korea missile test that he was ""very disappointed"" in China and that Beijing profits from U.S. trade but had done ""nothing"" for the United States with regards to North Korea, something he would not allow to continue.
""We see a bumpy road ahead for the trade relationship between the two countries"", said Yang Zhao, Nomura's chief China economist.
""But it is unlikely that the two nations will enter a true trade war."" 
Zhao said that part of the reason for China's bigger surplus with the U.S. this year is better performance of the world's no. 1 economy.
China is set to publish trade data on Tuesday. 
China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half, with net exports a positive contributor after being a drag on growth for two years. 
SOLID JULY DESPITE FINANCIAL CRACKDOWN?
Any slowdown in China's exports could present a challenge to the country's policymakers as a rebound in shipments abroad has helped stabilize economic growth amid a government crackdown on the property market and an overleveraged financial system.
The crackdown has seen a broad tightening in financial conditions, with higher borrowing costs seen cooling growth over coming months. 
But official and private purchasing manager surveys this week pointed to solid activity in the manufacturing sector and slightly slower growth in the services sector.
Other key data to be released over the next two weeks are expected to show economic growth remained solid in July, almost on par with June. 
Growth in fixed asset investment is expected to have been unchanged from June at 8.6 percent, while retail sales growth may have moderated slightly to 10.8 percent from 11.0 percent a month earlier, analysts said. 
Inflation is expected to have stayed muted last month, with the consumer price index (CPI) forecast to be unchanged from 1.5 percent in June. Producer prices are also seen steady from June's 5.5 percent rise. 
Industrial output, which increased by an unexpectedly high 7.6 percent in June, is forecast to ease off slightly to 7.2 percent growth in July. 
Inflation data will be published on Wednesday and fixed asset investment, retail and industrial output will be published on August 14. 
As China continues with an effort to reduce financial leverage in its highly indebted economy, money supply growth is expected to have remained at a record low of 9.4 percent in July. 
Loan data will also be closely watched for signs of whether the economy continued to build up more debt, amid signs that banks have shifted more credit back onto their books in response to the shadow financing clamp-down.
Bank lending probably declined to 800 billion yuan in July after lenders extended a greater-than-expected 1.54 trillion yuan ($229.04 billion) in loans in June. 
That would be the lowest amount since November as regulators call on banks to take a cautious approach to credit amid fast-rising mortgage lending. 
Analysts also expect China's foreign currency reserves, the largest in the world, to have increased slightly to $3.069 trillion in July from $3.057 trillion last month. 
China is set to publish foreign reserves data on Monday, while money supply and bank lending is expected anytime from August 10-15.

Retail sales in the euro zone increased by 0.5 percent in June on the month, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said, well above market expectations of a 0.1 percent rise.
As inflation slowed in June to 1.3 percent, showing little signs of a future rebound, euro zone consumers spent more than in May when retail sales went up by 0.4 percent. 
Inflation remained unchanged at 1.3 percent in July, preliminary estimates showed this week, raising expectations that retail sales may continue to grow healthily in July, helping the bloc start the third quarter with robust growth.
The euro zone's economy expanded by 0.5 percent in the January-March period and by 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
Year-on-year, the volume of retail sales surged 3.1 percent in June, higher than the 2.6 percent rise forecast by economists polled by Reuters. 
It was the highest expansion recorded this year, well above the downwardly revised 2.4 percent increase in May.
Month-on-month retail sales rose 1.0 percent in June for car fuel after a 0.6 percent growth in May. 
Shoppers also bought more food, tobacco and drink products for which sales increased by 0.7 percent on the month, after they dropped 0.2 percent in May.
Shoppers were more inclined to spend both on durable and non-durable goods, in a sign that consumption is more widely spread across the population, as unemployment falls. In June unemployment reached its lowest rate in the euro zone since 2009.
Sales of non-durable goods such as clothes and footwear went up in June by 1.4 percent on the month, while consumers spent also 1.3 percent more on furniture and electrical goods.
Pharmaceuticals and medical goods were the only component of the indicator that showed a fall in June, dropping by 0.2 percent on the month after a 1.1 percent surge in May.
Among the largest economies of the euro zone, sales went up by 1.1 percent in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, more than twice than the 0.5 percent rise recorded in May.
Spain's retail sales grew 0.7 percent while in the Netherlands they increased by 0.9 percent on the month.
France was the only major economy of the bloc to record a fall in sales. Shoppers there spent 0.3 percent less in June than in the previous month, partly offsetting the 0.5 percent rise recorded in May. Data for Italy were not available.

Outside the euro zone, Britain recorded in June a 0.3 percent drop in monthly retail sales, the second consecutive decline after the 0.3 percent fall in May.

The comment, published in the ECB's economic bulletin, suggests its view of price pressures remains cautious as it prepares to decide whether to wind down its 2.3 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion) stimulus program.
Years of low inflation had had a knock-on effect on wage negotiations.
Other factors in the slow pace of wage growth ""include still significant slack in the labor market, weak productivity growth and the ongoing impact of labor market reforms,"" it said.
Higher prices around the world also had yet to start spreading to euro zone consumer goods other than food and ""more generally, underlying domestic price pressures remain subdued.""
Given the cloudy inflation outlook, ECB rate setters are reluctant to withdraw their monetary support despite strong economic growth and falling unemployment.
The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to postpone a decision on the future of its bond-buying program until October, rate-setters told Reuters after their July 20 policy meeting.
A recent strengthening of the euro, a hit for euro zone exporters and a check on import prices, has further complicated the policy picture.
Euro zone inflation was 1.3 percent in July, official estimates showed this week, still well below the ECB's target of just under 2 percent.
Investors will look for signs on Thursday that Britain is getting nearer to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade, following a policy meeting at which the Bank of England is expected to keep them at a record low once again.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 53.8 last month from a reading of 53.4 in June.
Analysts had expected the index to edge forward to just 53.6.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The research group indicated that the reading was just a slight uptick from June’s four-month low and warned that optimism regarding the business outlook remained subdued.
On the upside, the report recognized that employment numbers rose at the fastest pace since January 2016.
“The service sector PMI indicates that businesses remain in expansion-mode despite heightened uncertainty about the outlook, but also highlights how the risks to future growth remain firmly biased to the downside.,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Williamson noted that the data from the three surveys combined (services, manufacturing and construction) suggests growth of around 0.3%, putting the country on track for what he considered would be “another steady but sluggish expansion in the third quarter”.
This expert warned that the subdued levels of business optimism suggested that growth will at least remain modest and could even weaken in the coming months.
“Firms’ prospects for the coming year have slipped to a level which has previously been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting, having taken a lurch downward since the general election, largely reflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and Brexit process,” he concluded.
Following the report, the pound moved higher. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3258 from around 1.3229 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8926 from 0.8946 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 146.76 compared to 146.40 previously.

The findings were in line with an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector published on Monday which also showed growth in the services sector cooled, adding to views that China's economy could slow slightly in coming months after a strong start to the year.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 51.5 in July from 51.6 in June.
While the drop was marginal, the reading matched the level in April which was the lowest since May 2016.
New business continued to expand at a decent clip but at a slightly slower pace. The rate of growth in new work eased to a 16-month low.
Employment in the services industry improved slightly as companies continued to add workers, albeit at a slower pace.
China is counting on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to lessen the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment.
The services sector, accounting for just over half of China's economy in the first half of the year, grew 7.7 percent in the period, easily outpacing overall GDP growth of 6.9 percent.
But growth in the finance and real estate industries slowed to multi-year lows in the second quarter as property transactions in many cities declined amid regulatory efforts to tamp down speculation and rein in risky activities in the financial sector.
The decline in the services sector, taken alongside Caixin's survey on Tuesday showing an uptick in manufacturing, suggests China continues to rely on heavy industry and government stimulus for economic growth, which benefits mainly large state-owned firms.
Indeed, the gap between Caixin's service and manufacturing sector readings in July was the smallest its been in three years, according to a Reuters calculation based on historical data.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Thursday, rose to 51.9 in July from 51.1 in June and was the highest in four months.
""China's economic performance in July was stronger than expected, mainly due to sustained recovery in the manufacturing sector"", Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release.

""However, downward pressure on the economy likely remains as the index gauging companies' confidence towards the 12-month business outlook dropped in both the manufacturing and services industries.""

214,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer price inflation slows in June to lowest this year,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone prices at factory gates grew in June at their slowest pace this year, raising the prospect of a further easing of consumer inflation later in the year, data released by the European Union's statistics office showed on Wednesday.
Eurostat said industrial producer prices in the 19-country currency bloc increased 2.5 percent on the year in June, slowing from an upwardly revised 3.4 percent rise in May and a 4.3 percent surge in April.
The June figure was the lowest this year in a further sign that inflationary pressures are easing, complicating European Central Bank's plans to begin a gradual tightening of its monetary policy in autumn.
Headline inflation was stable at 1.3 percent in July, far from its 2.0 percent peak reached in February, according to preliminary estimates released by Eurostat this week. The ECB's target is for an inflation rate below, but close to 2 percent.
Despite the monthly easing, producer prices increased on the year by more than forecast by economists polled by Reuters, who had predicted on average a 2.4 percent rise in June.
On the month, prices eased in June by 0.1 percent, in line with market expectations. In May industrial prices went down by 0.3 percent on the month, slightly less than the 0.4 percent fall previously estimated by Eurostat.
Eurostat's estimates showed a slowdown of industry inflation also in its core indicator that excludes volatile energy prices, with a year-on-year 2.2 percent rise in June after a 2.4 percent increase in May a 2.6 percent rise in April.
Inflation in energy prices in the manufacturing sector eased to 2.9 percent from 5.8 percent in May. Prices grew at a lower pace also for intermediate goods and durable consumer goods, such as cars.

They grew at a stable pace for non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes, and capital goods.

215,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2017 04:31AM ET</span>",UK construction PMI falls to 11-month low in July ,"Investing.com - UK construction sector activity dropped more than expected in July, hitting an 11-month low, industry data showed on Tuesday
In a report, market research firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their UK construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.9 last month from June’s reading of 54.8.
Economists had expected the index to drop to only 54.5 in July.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that the reading was its weakest performance since August 2016 as commercial work fell at the fastest pace for 12 months.
The research firm further indicated that a decline in new orders led to softer job creation in July.
“July data reveals a growth slowdown in the UK construction sector, mainly driven by lower volumes of commercial development and a loss of momentum for house building,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
“Weaker contributions from the cyclically sensitive areas of construction activity more than offset resilience in the civil engineering sector,” he added.
Moore further pointed out that supply chain pressure remained intense while materials prices continued to rise at one of the fastest rates seen for six years.
“The combination of weaker order books and sharply rising construction costs gives concern that an extended soft patch for the construction sector may be on the horizon,” Moore warned.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3231 compared to 1.3232 ahead of the release, EUR/GBP was at 0.8963 compared to 0.8947 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 146.47 compared to 146.67 previously.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 04:20PM ET</span>","U.S. spending, factory data point to moderate economic growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. factory activity slid from a near three-year high in July amid a slowdown in new orders and consumer spending barely rose in the prior month, setting the stage for a moderate economic expansion in the third quarter.
That was reinforced by other reports on Tuesday showing motor vehicle sales in July recorded their biggest year-on-year drop in nearly seven years. A plunge in construction spending in June suggested the government could cut its second-quarter GDP growth estimate.
The Commerce Department reported last week that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June period, accelerating from the first-quarter's tepid 1.2 percent pace.
""If the consumer has any say, don't expect any major improvement in growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Yes, manufacturers are saying things are good, but with vehicle sales trending downward compared to last year, it is likely there is little room for further improvement."" 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 56.3 last month from 57.8 in June, which was the highest level since August 2014. 
A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing is slowing as a boost from the energy sector ebbs after a burst in oil well drilling activity.
It is also being hurt by declining automobile production as companies respond to falling sales that have left them with an inventory bloat. Motor vehicle output has dropped for three straight quarters.
General Motors Co (N:GM) reported on Tuesday that its sales fell 15 percent in July from a year ago and rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported a 7.5 percent sales decline. Overall motor vehicle sales dropped 6.1 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted 16.73 million-unit rate from a year ago. That was the largest year-on-year decline since August 2010.
The ISM survey's production sub-index fell 1.8 points to 60.6 last month. Though a gauge of new orders slipped to 60.4 from 63.5 in June, manufacturers were upbeat about demand.
Manufacturers in the chemical, computer and electronic and nonmetallic mineral products sector reported either strong orders growth or demand.
Machinery makers described business as very steady, but said ""everyone is waiting till the last minute to place their orders."" Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers said they were starting to see better ""order entry"" and planning on a turnaround for 2018.
While a measure of factory employment dropped two points to 55.2, manufacturers reported employees leaving for other opportunities and some said labor shortages were ""pretty universal.""
The U.S. dollar (DXY) rebounded from a 15-month low against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries also reversed course and ended higher. U.S. stocks rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a record high.
TEPID DEMAND In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent gain in May. 
There was also little sign of inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through June, after advancing by the same margin in May.
The so-called core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent target.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged in June after rising 0.2 percent in May. June's flat reading points to moderate consumer spending growth in the third quarter. The data was included in last Friday's GDP report.
Since accelerating at a 3.8 percent pace in the second quarter of 2016, consumer spending growth has remained below a 3.0 percent rate, restrained by sluggish income gains.
In June, personal income was unchanged. That was the weakest reading since a 0.1 percent dip in November 2016 and followed a 0.3 percent increase in May. Wages and salaries rose 0.4 percent in June. 
Personal dividend income declined 3.0 percent after surging 4.8 percent in May on a boost from Apple Inc (O:AAPL). Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation fell 0.1 percent, the largest decrease since last December. 
In another report, the Commerce Department said construction spending in June tumbled 1.3 percent to $1.21 trillion, the lowest level since September 2016.
Construction spending was weighed down by a 5.4 percent plunge in public investment, which was the biggest decline since March 2002. The drop occurred across federal, state and local governments. Hopes that President Donald Trump's vow to boost infrastructure spending would kick off a construction boom have now largely faded.

""Public construction spending will remain on a soft trend,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The decline in construction spending in June points to a downward revision worth roughly two-tenths of a percentage point off of second-quarter real GDP growth.""

217,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 03:47PM ET</span>",U.S. auto sales fall in July as carmakers slash rental fleet sales,"By Joseph White and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. carmakers said on Tuesday they continued to slash low-margin sales to daily rental fleets in July as the overall pace of U.S. car and light truck sales fell for the fifth straight month.
The annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales in July fell to 16.73 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales. 
Investors sold shares in the Detroit Three automakers on Tuesday. General Motors Co (N:GM) fell about 3.5 percent and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) slid about 2.5 percent.
Several major automakers, including GM, Ford,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said they sharply reduced rental car sales in July, and they portrayed the decisions as putting profit ahead of sales volume. 
Automakers have used low-margin sales to rental fleets to avoid factory shutdowns. With more flexible labor agreements, the Detroit automakers have shifted course. They are quicker to idle factories to reduce supply, and they are demanding higher prices, industry officials said. Fiat Chrysler has killed several models it once sold to fleets.
Big U.S. rental car companies such as  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ) and Avis Budget Car Rental [CARXXB.UL] at the same time are restructuring their fleets as values decline for rental cars they resell, and as ride services such as Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] bite into their business.
In a more troubling sign for Detroit, combined sales of large pickups fell 4 percent, and sales of large sport utility vehicles declined by 20 percent. Only the Ford F-series, up 6 percent, improved on year-ago results among major truck models. 
Declining sales could leave the Detroit Three with too many plants in North America, Jeff Schuster, a forecaster with LMC Automotive, said on Tuesday at an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich. The decline in July's annual sales pace from a year ago equates to the output of four assembly plants.
GM gained little ground in its effort to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles. The automaker had 104 days of supply at the end of July, down from 105 days at the end of June. GM has promised investors to reduce inventories to 70 days by year-end.
Ford said July sales fell 7.5 percent, but inventory fell to 77 days from 79 the previous month. Fiat Chrysler said sales dropped 10 percent.
Among the top Japanese companies, only Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported a year-to-year gain, with sales up 4 percent. Honda Motor Co (T:7267) sales fell 1 percent, and Nissan sales fell 3 percent.

GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have said second-half financial results likely will be lower than first-half results, in part reflecting production cuts in North America and pricing pressures.

The Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index  slipped to 51.2 in July from 52.3 in June when adjusted for seasonal swings.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that points to contraction.
""July's survey data suggests that the Mexican manufacturing sector is struggling to break out from its recent slow growth trajectory,"" IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore said in a statement.
Moore noted readings on output and new orders slowed after export sales fell for the first time in 12 months.
On the positive side, job creation picked up to its fastest pace in more than a year in July.

The Mexican peso has bounced back this year and business confidence has improved as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and moved toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and TVs, to the United States.
The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending tumbled 1.3 percent to $1.21 trillion, the lowest level since September 2016. Spending in May was revised to show it rising 0.3 percent. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.4 percent in June after it was previously reported as being unchanged in May. Construction spending increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.
The government said on Friday in its advance gross domestic product estimate that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. 
In June, investment in public construction projects plunged 5.4 percent, the biggest drop since March 2002. The decline pushed public construction spending to its lowest level since February 2014.
Outlays on state and local government construction projects fell 5.1 percent in June, also the largest fall since March 2002. Federal government construction spending slumped 9.3 percent, the largest drop since December 2010.
Spending on private construction projects slipped 0.1 percent after a similar drop in May. Investment in private residential construction fell 0.2 percent. 

Spending on private nonresidential structures edged up 0.1 percent in June after surging 0.6 percent in May. Investment in residential and nonresidential structures such as oil and gas wells is slowing as the boost from oil prices fades.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of manufacturing activity retreated to 56.3 last month from June’s reading of 57.8.
Analysts had forecast the index to fall to only 56.5.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
Despite the worse-than-expected reading, the ISM indicated that the survey suggested that the overall economy had grown for the 98th consecutive month.

The prices paid index rose to 62.0 in July, from the previous reading of 55.0. Economists had forecast an increase to just 55.5.
“Comments from the panel generally reflect expanding business conditions, with new orders, production, employment, backlog and exports all growing in July compared to June, as well as supplier deliveries slowing (improving) and inventories unchanged during the period,” the ISM noted.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 09:53AM ET</span>",Euro zone economy outperforms Britain for second straight quarter,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy confirmed a robust expansion in the second quarter of the year, growing twice as much as Britain for the second consecutive quarter, preliminary estimates released by the European Union's statistics agency showed on Tuesday.
The reading confirmed the trend begun this year as the 19-country currency bloc consolidates its recovery while Britain starts to feel the negative impact of its decision to quit the European Union.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro zone increased 0.6 percent on the quarter, after a slightly downwardly revised 0.5 percent rise in the first quarter, Eurostat's data showed. 
In the March-June period, Britain's economic output grew by 0.3 percent on the quarter, edging up from a sluggish rate of 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year.
Britain's slowdown comes after the country showed robust growth last year, outgrowing the euro zone in the last three quarters.
The loss of pace coincides with the beginning of divorce talks with the EU in March and increased prospects of no access to the EU market after Brexit for Britain-based companies.
Meanwhile, the euro zone economy has picked up speed, bolstered by higher business optimism, strong domestic consumption and decreasing unemployment, which in June reached its lowest level since 2009. 
In annualized terms, the euro zone economy expanded 2.3 percent in the second quarter after a 2.0 percent rise in the first three months of the year, Eurostat said.
""All in all, the euro zone economy has rounded out the first half of the year in a very healthy state and seems to be set up nicely for continued firm growth for the rest of 2017,"" Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING said.
In its latest forecasts, released in July, the International Monetary Fund estimated the euro zone would grow 1.9 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2018, above Britain's projected growth of 1.7 percent this year and 1.5 percent next.
The EU economics commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, said the new estimates could likely lead to an upwardly revision of the commission's forecasts, which in May predicted a 1.7 percent rise of euro zone's output this year and 1.8 percent in 2018.
Updated estimates of euro zone GDP growth in the second quarter will be released by Eurostat on August 16 and final data will come on September 7. 

The healthier state of the bloc's economy could support European Central Bank's plans to begin a tightening of monetary policy in autumn, although headline inflation remained stable at 1.3 percent in July, below the ECB target of below but close to 2 percent.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that personal spending increased 0.1% in June from the prior month. That was in line with consensus but slightly below the revised reading of 0.2% in May (initially a 0.1% gain).
Consumer spending is the single biggest source of U.S. economic growth, accounting for as much as two-thirds of economic activity.
Personal income, meanwhile, unexpectedly registered a flat reading in June, compared to expectations for a 0.4% rise. That was after rising 0.3% a month earlier, revised down from the initial reading of a 0.4% advance.
Meanwhile, the core PCE price index rose 0.1% in June from a month earlier, in line with forecasts and the previous month’s reading.
The core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1.5% in June, beating expectations for a gain of 1.3%. May’s rise was also increased to 1.5% from initial 1.4% increase.
The Federal Reserve uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.
The report also showed that real personal consumption went unchanged in June, missing expectations for a gain of 0.1% and following an advance of 0.2% in May that was revised from an initial increase of 0.1%.

The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, cut its benchmark Selic rate by 100 basis points on July 26, to a near four-year low of 9.25 percent. 
The minutes showed the policymakers considered flagging a smaller rate cut for their next meeting in September. But they opted instead to signal a rate cut of 100 bps.
Lower interest rates should help Brazil's economy recover after its worst recession on record ended in the first quarter. 
Annual inflation, which surpassed 10 percent less than two years ago, has plunged to just 2.78 percent, the lowest in 18 years and below the lower boundary of the official target range.
Copom said the September rate cut will remain conditioned on the economic outlook and on prospects for measures to reduce public spending and boost productivity. 
Last week's rate cut was the seventh since October in a cycle expected to take rates as low as 7.75 percent by the end of the year, according to a weekly central bank poll of economists on Monday.
The central bank said a recent fuel tax hike will not have significant consequences for monetary policy. 

The minutes also said all Copom members agreed that the economy appears to have stabilized after its two-year-long recession but that the pace of recovery remains uncertain.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 06:44AM ET</span>","Factories motoring ahead, show scant evidence of braking","By Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factories across the world powered into July, providing evidence that economic momentum has carried through into the second half despite central banks in the West preparing to start scaling back years of massive stimulus.
Growth in the euro zone remained buoyant, British manufacturing recovered in July from a seven-month low and Chinese factory activity unexpectedly expanded. A survey due later from the United States is expected to suggest factories chugged along at a slightly more modest, but still solid, pace.
""The world economy was doing quite well in the second quarter and nothing has changed in July. The overall picture is pretty healthy,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
""There is nothing immediately on the horizon to cause the global economy generally to slow. Central banks are moving very slowly to remove stimulus -- but it is very slow and cautious so I don't think that will cause any problems.""
China and the euro zone are key to the second-half outlook, with those regions seen driving a larger share of the global recovery because political turmoil in Washington imperils President Donald Trump's plans to pass stimulus plans.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its growth projections for China and Europe, while keeping its global forecast at 3.5 percent.
Full-year growth in China is widely expected to meet the government's target of 6.5 percent handily but most analysts predict the broader economy will begin to cool eventually as regulators maintain a clampdown on riskier types of lending.
In the second quarter, the euro zone economy expanded 0.6 percent, matching a median forecast in a Reuters poll and confirming the bloc's robust recovery. It will give the European Central Bank more grounds for tweaking its monetary policy in the autumn.
In September, the ECB is expected to announce a shift away from its ultra-easy policy, according to a Reuters poll. 
While the U.S. Federal Reserve and ECB are expected to slowly normalize policy after years of cheap money, many Asian central bankers are likely to be more cautious about tapping the brakes for fear of derailing their recoveries.
Australia's central bank kept its cash rate unchanged at a record low 1.5 percent on Tuesday, despite saying the domestic and global economy continue to improve.
Still, signs British factories had a good month should hearten Bank of England policymakers ahead of Thursday's interest rate announcement.
But more focus will be on Thursday's PMI for the services industry, which drives the bulk of the Britain's economic output. Only two of 80 economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will raise its main interest rate this week. 
GROWTH
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone dipped to 56.6 from June's six-year high of 57.4, slightly down from a flash estimate of 56.8. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. 
Pointing to momentum continuing, new orders remained firm, backlogs of work built up and hiring was strong. The expansion came despite factories increasing prices for the tenth month.
Tuesday's Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI rose to 55.1 from a downwardly revised 54.2 in June, exceeding the 54.4 consensus in a Reuters poll. 
""A combination of the weaker pound and increasing global growth optimism is boosting sentiment amongst firms,"" said James Smith at ING.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a four-month high of 51.1, well ahead of June's 50.4, as export orders flooded in.
The findings were more upbeat than official data on Monday, which suggested a slight loss of momentum. But taken together they pointed to continued resilience in the world's second-largest economy and the possibility its industrial recovery may last a bit longer than expected.
""The key takeaway from the PMIs is China, which shows that the momentum is still ongoing into the start of the third quarter,"" said Khoon Goh at ANZ.
""We do expect a bit of a growth slowdown (in Asia) in the second half but full-year growth numbers to be an improvement from last year's.""
Threats of growing U.S. protectionism continues to hang over Asia's trade-reliant economies.
Though Trump did not follow through on many of his protectionism threats made during the campaign, there are signs the U.S. administration is growing frustrated at a lack of concessions from its major trading partners. 
So the picture was mixed for Asia, with factory activity shrinking in Indonesia and Malaysia. India, one of the world's fastest growing economies, saw its manufacturing sector slam into reverse, as a new Goods and Services Tax (GST) sowed confusion among producers. 
In Japan, there were signs sluggish domestic demand is picking up, though stubbornly low inflation likely mean its central bank will not pare back its radical stimulus until long after the Fed and ECB.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",U.S. small business borrowing highest in nearly two years,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. companies hit a nearly two-year high in June, driven by restaurants and hotels, PayNet Inc said on Tuesday, as businesses invested to meet customer demand.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index for June rose to 139.9, its highest since July 2015, from an upwardly revised May reading of 138.3.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because those companies do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Still, measured from a year earlier, borrowing was flat, according to the provider of credit ratings on small companies.
""It really tells me they are still seeing a lot of uncertainty from policy,"" PayNet founder and Chief Executive Bill Phelan said by phone, referring to the lack of annual growth in borrowing. ""If you don't know what policies are going to be, you are not going to put money to work.""
Turmoil in Washington surrounding U.S. President's Donald Trump's six-month-old administration has led investors and businesses to question whether many his proposals will be implemented. Last week Republicans failed to deliver on a campaign promise to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, and Trump on Monday fired his communications director after just a week on the job.
Borrowing by firms providing food and accommodation rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier, Phelan said. But that growth was offset by declines in other sectors, including a 12 percent drop by healthcare-related companies. 
Movements in the index typically correspond with changes in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual pace in the second quarter, more than double the 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter, though wage growth has continued to be sluggish.
A separate barometer of small companies' financial health suggested companies are finding it easier to pay off old loans. The share of loans more than 30 days past due was 1.67 percent in June, down from 1.69 percent a month earlier, PayNet data showed. 
PayNet collects loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product in the euro area rose 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to July from a downwardly revised 0.5% in the first quarter and by 2.1% year-on-year, up from 1.9% in the first quarter.
Economists had forecast growth of 0.6% in the quarter and 2.4% year-on-year.
The solid data did little to alter expectations that the European Central Bank will decide to begin scaling back its asset purchase program in the autumn.
The data came a day after figures showing that headline inflation in the euro zone rose in line with forecasts in July, but underlying inflation rose to the highest in four years.
The annual rate of inflation rose by 1.3% in July, according to a preliminary reading from Eurostat.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile components and is seen as a more reliable gauge of inflationary pressures, rose to 1.2%. It was the highest reading since August 2013."
229,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 04:31AM ET</span>",UK manufacturing PMI rises more than expected in July,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the UK rose more than expected in July, bolstering optimism over the British economy at the beginning of the third quarter, industry data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its UK manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.1 last month from a reading of 54.2 in June.
Analysts had expected the PMI to tick up to 54.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit highlighted that solid new order intakes were boosted by strong export performance while job creation was among the best recorded in the past three years.
“The headline PMI signaled a growth acceleration for the first time in three months during July, as new order intakes were boosted by a near survey-record increase in new export business,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit, said.
“Although the exchange rate remains a key driver of export growth, manufacturers also benefitted from stronger economic growth in key markets in the euro area, North America and Asia-Pacific regions,” he added.
Dobson also noted in that the report that price pressures saw further easing with input prices showing their weakest pace of increase in over a year.
“If this trend of milder price pressures is also reflected in other areas of the UK economy, this should provide the Bank of England sufficient lee-way to maintain its current supportive stance until the medium-term outlook for economic growth becomes less uncertain,” he concluded.
After the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3224 from around 1.3201 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8934 compared to 0.8951 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 145.84 compared to 145.48 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.70%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.40%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.55%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.41%."

LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Factories in the euro zone started the second half with buoyant growth, which although slightly weaker than previously estimated was broad-based and appears to be sustainable, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dipped to 56.6 from June's six-year high of 57.4, slightly down from a flash estimate of 56.8. Any reading above 50 indicates growth.
An output index that feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday fell to 56.5 from 58.7, which was the highest since April 2011.
""Euro zone factories were buzzing with activity again in July,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The PMI came in slightly below the earlier flash estimate, slipping to a four-month low, but this is still an encouragingly buoyant reading.""
New orders remained firm, backlogs of work built up and hiring was strong, suggesting August will remain lively. The expansion came despite factories increasing prices for the 10th month.
The output price index was 53.7, down from June's 54.3 but comfortably above the breakeven mark - welcome news to the European Central Bank, which has struggled to get inflation anywhere near its 2 percent target ceiling.
Prices rose 1.3 percent last month, official data showed on Monday, while unemployment in June dropped to its lowest level since 2009, confirming the economy's robust recovery and giving the ECB more ground for tightening its monetary policy in the autumn.
In September, the ECB is likely to announce a shift away from its ultra-easy policy, according to a Reuters poll.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 03:03AM ET</span>","Australia's central bank keeps rate steady, dismayed at high-flying A$","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Tuesday marked a full year without changing interest rates, and many economists suspect rates could stay at record lows of 1.5 percent for yet another year as it wrestles with a strong currency and weak inflation.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stepped up its rhetoric against a rising local dollar saying the higher exchange rate will further compress consumer prices, weighing on the outlook for growth and employment.
The Australian dollar has jumped about 8 percent since June to a two-year peak, largely driven by a battered greenback. It was last steady at $0.8010. 
In response the RBA inserted a new paragraph in its latest policy statement, saying, ""an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.""
While the RBA did sound upbeat about the overall economy, its optimism was restrained by tepid inflation, record-low wages growth and mounting consumer debt.
Subdued inflation, however, is not an Australian phenomenon. Consumer prices remain low or sluggish in most major economies including the United States, Europe and China even as growth has stayed largely solid. That has partly led the Federal Reserve to tamp down on market expectations over the future pace of tightening. 
Core inflation - the main focus for policymakers - has remained below the RBA's target band since early 2016, prompting it to lower interest rates twice last year.
The central bank expects a gradual pick-up in inflation and forecast the A$1.7 trillion economy to grow at around 3 percent over the next couple of years. 
""The main surprise was a ramping up in the level of concern about the stronger Aussie,"" said CBA economist Michael Blythe.
""The RBA last pulled the policy lever in August 2016. We suspect another year of masterly inactivity is in store from here. And any serious debate about lifting rates is unlikely before late 2018."" 
A majority of the 42 economists polled by Reuters forecast a steady rate outlook over a one-year horizon, with only 9 expecting a rate hike. 
SUBDUED SPENDING
One positive is the recent pick up in the labor market with more full-time jobs than part-time. Corporate profits are surging while measures of business confidence and conditions are the strongest since 2008. 
Still, wages growth is stuck at a record low 1.9 percent - less than half the rate workers enjoyed a decade ago.
That, together with record high household debt at 190 percent of disposable income, is crimping consumer spending.
""One source of uncertainty for the domestic economy is the outlook for consumption. Retail sales have picked up recently, but slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt are likely to constrain growth in spending,"" the RBA said.
Household indebtedness has increased as more Australians speculate in the property market, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne where prices have broadly doubled since 2008. 
Regulators have taken stringent action since the start of the year to ease the brisk pace of house prices and, while there are early signs of a slowdown, the RBA is not fully convinced those measures are bearing fruit.
""It is clear that the RBA harbors some concerns about the consumer outlook and the slow pace of wage rises, despite its constructive views on employment,"" said Citi economist Paul Brennan. 

""We continue to expect no change in the cash rate this year and well into next year.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factories in China and Japan motored ahead in July, giving investors optimism that the global economy can carry momentum through into the second half of the year as central banks in the West prepare to start scaling back years of massive stimulus.
Similar surveys from Europe later in the day are expected to point to strong expansion in manufacturing on the continent, while U.S. factories likely chugged along at a slightly more modest but still solid pace.
A revival in world trade this year and improving domestic demand in many economies have produced a string of forecast-beating company earnings reports in recent weeks, boosting MSCI's global stock index to record highs.
In China, factory activity unexpectedly expanded at the fastest pace in four months in July as export orders flooded in, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.1, well ahead of June's 50.4 and the 50 break-even level.
The findings were more upbeat than official data on Monday, which suggested a slight loss of momentum. But taken together they pointed to continued resilience in the world's second-largest economy and the possibility that its industrial recovery may last a bit longer than expected.
""The key takeaway from the PMIs is China, which shows that the momentum is still ongoing into the start of the third quarter,"" Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.
""The PMIs in the rest of the region are somewhat mixed. We do expect a bit of a growth slowdown (in Asia) in the second half but full-year growth numbers to be an improvement from last year's.""
In Japan, there were signs that sluggish domestic demand is picking up, though stubbornly low inflation likely mean its central bank will not pare back its radical stimulus till long after the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which could start reducing their huge stash of bonds in the near future.
While Japanese factories saw export orders soften, a global electronics rally which has buoyed North Asia's hi-tech firms is likely to get a fresh lift heading into the peak year-end shopping season. Japan's exports rose nearly 10 percent in June.
South Korea reported a near 20 percent surge in July exports on Tuesday, driven by demand for memory chips, though heavyweights like LG Electronics may be reaping the lion's share of the trade windfall, while small firms struggle.
In Taiwan, factories kicked up production and stepped up hiring, also riding the tech boom.
The picture was more mixed for emerging economies in Asia, which factory activity shrinking in Indonesia and Malaysia.
India, one of the world's fastest growing economies, saw its manufacturing sector slam into reverse, with activity shrinking the most in over nine years as a new Goods and Services (GST) sowed confusion among producers.
CHINA, EUROPE KEY
China and the eurozone are key to the second-half outlook, with those regions seen driving a larger share of the global recovery as political turmoil in Washington imperils President Donald Trump's plans to quickly pass stimulus plans.
The International Monetary Fund last week upgraded its growth projections for China and Europe, while keeping its global forecast at 3.5 percent.
The euro zone July manufacturing PMI is seen hitting 56.8, matching the June figures.
In the United States, the Chicago PMI came in overnight at 58.9, off June's three-year high of 65.7 but still solid. The ISM manufacturing PMI later on Tuesday is expected to slip to 56.5, from the previous month's 57.8.
Full-year growth in China is widely expected to handily meet the government's target of 6.5 percent, after stronger-than-forecast growth of 6.9 percent in the first half, driven by a year-long building boom, solid exports and retail sales.
Official data showed construction activity accelerated in July, despite expectations of a slowdown. But most analysts still expect the broader economy will begin to cool eventually as regulators maintain a clampdown on riskier types of lending which is pushing financing costs higher.
""We don't think this pick-up is sustainable ... given the increasing headwinds from policy tightening,,"" Capital Economics China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said.
The threat of growing U.S. protectionism also continues to hang over Asia's trade-reliant economies.
Though Trump did not follow through on many of his protectionism threats made during the campaign, there are signs the U.S. administration is growing frustrated at a lack of concessions from its major trading partners.
The United States and China failed last month to agree on major steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, and tensions over North Korea may further strain relations. The U.S. is considering fresh curbs on steel imports.
DIVERGING POLICY PATHS
While the Fed and ECB are expected to slowly normalize policy after years of cheap money, Asian central bankers are likely to be more cautious about tapping the brakes for fear of derailing their recoveries, ANZ's Goh said.
Australia's central bank kept its cash rate unchanged at a record low 1.5 percent on Tuesday, despite saying the domestic and global economy continue to improve.
""Labor markets have tightened further and above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain,"" it said in a statement.

Bucking the global trend, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut rates on Wednesday after inflation eased to the lowest in more than five years.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2017 01:50AM ET</span>",Japan July final manufacturing PMI slows to eight-month low as exports falter,"TOKYO,(Reuters) - - Japan's manufacturing activity grew in July at the slowest pace in eight months as export demand weakened, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) dipped to 52.1 in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, slightly weaker than a preliminary reading of 52.2 and a final 52.4 in the previous month.
But despite the somewhat softer reading, the headline PMI index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 11th consecutive month.
""The expansion of the Japanese manufacturing sector was undermined somewhat during July by a slump in new export order growth, which led to the lowest rises in both output and new orders since the final few months of last year,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The final reading for new export orders was 50.9, above the flash reading of 50.0 but a marked slowdown from 53.4 in June.
But overall new orders did not soften as sharply, suggesting a pickup in domestic demand that may have partly offset the sudden weakness overseas. Domestic demand has been a soft spot in the economy.
The output index fell to 51.4, unchanged from the flash reading and lower than a final 52.2 in June.
Still, manufacturers were the most optimistic about future output in five years, citing an ongoing boom in global electronics demand and additional business expected in the lead up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Companies continued to add staff to handle increased orders, and were able to pass on some of their higher input costs by raising the prices of their goods slightly.
While Japan's economy is expanding at a modest pace and the labor market is tightening, inflation has been stubbornly weak.

Government data on Monday showed companies expect output to grow at a slightly slower pace in July and then accelerate in August, which has given economists reason to be optimistic that industrial production will continue to expand at a healthy pace.

At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy are continuing to improve. Labour markets have tightened further and above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. Growth in the Chinese economy has picked up a little and is being supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, with the high level of debt continuing to present a medium-term risk. Commodity prices have generally risen recently, although Australia's terms of trade are still expected to decline over the period ahead.
Wage growth remains subdued in most countries, as does core inflation. Headline inflation rates have declined recently, largely reflecting the earlier decline in oil prices. In the United States, the Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates further and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively and volatility remains low.
The Bank's forecasts for the Australian economy are largely unchanged. Over the next couple of years, the central forecast is for the economy to grow at an annual rate of around 3 per cent. The transition to lower levels of mining investment following the mining investment boom is almost complete, with some large LNG projects now close to completion. Business conditions have improved and capacity utilisation has increased. Some pick-up in non-mining business investment is expected. The current high level of residential construction is forecast to be maintained for some time, before gradually easing. One source of uncertainty for the domestic economy is the outlook for consumption. Retail sales have picked up recently, but slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt are likely to constrain growth in spending.
Employment growth has been stronger over recent months, and has increased in all states. The various forward-looking indicators point to continued growth in employment over the period ahead. The unemployment rate is expected to decline a little over the next couple of years. Against this, however, wage growth remains low and this is likely to continue for a while yet.
The recent inflation data were broadly as the Bank expected. Both CPI inflation and measures of underlying inflation are running at a little under 2 per cent. Inflation is expected to pick up gradually as the economy strengthens. Higher prices for electricity and tobacco are expected to boost CPI inflation. A factor working in the other direction is increased competition from new entrants in the retail industry.
The Australian dollar has appreciated recently, partly reflecting a lower US dollar. The higher exchange rate is expected to contribute to subdued price pressures in the economy. It is also weighing on the outlook for output and employment. An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
Conditions in the housing market vary considerably around the country. Housing prices have been rising briskly in some markets, although there are some signs that these conditions are starting to ease. In some other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Rent increases remain low in most cities. Investors in residential property are facing higher interest rates. There has also been some tightening of credit conditions following recent supervisory measures to address the risks associated with high and rising levels of household indebtedness. Growth in housing debt has been outpacing the slow growth in household incomes.
The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

But even as firms boosted purchasing in anticipation of more business, employment levels at factories fell at the fastest pace in 10 months and a reading on business outlook was the lowest since last August - a sign that economic momentum may start to ebb in the months ahead.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.1 in July, above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction, and well ahead of the 50.4 in June which was also the median figure forecast by 21 analysts in a Reuters survey.
A resurgent export sector underpinned by a brightening global economy helped China post surprisingly strong gross domestic product growth of 6.9 percent in the first half of the year.
The Caixin readings diverged from an official PMI survey released on Monday which showed growth in China's manufacturing sector cooled slightly last month due to slackening export demand. The private survey, however, tends to focus on smaller firms while the official PMI covers mostly larger firms, many of them state-owned manufacturers.
""Operating conditions in the manufacturing sector improved further in July, suggesting the economy's growth momentum will be sustained."" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release.
""That said, it's unlikely that financial regulatory tightening will be relaxed.""
The broader consensus among China watchers is that economic growth will cool in coming months as a government crackdown on financial risks raises borrowing costs, squeezing profits and output. Yet, there appears more than enough momentum to reach Beijing's growth target of around 6.5 percent for the year.
The Caixin new export orders reading came in at 53.5 in July, up from 50.9 June and the highest since February.
While China's foreign trade faces a mostly positive environment in the second half of the year, uncertainties still exist, Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming said in Beijing on Monday.
The United States and China failed earlier this month to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, casting doubt over President Donald Trump's economic and security relations with Beijing.
Chinese goods producers in July were able to raise output prices the most since March, Tuesday's PMI showed, as input inflation also accelerated, though the price gains were much milder than those seen around the turn of the year.
Companies still expected to increase output over the next 12 months, but the reading was the lowest since August.
On the whole, while China's manufacturing sector has remained resilient, companies' outlook has now worsened or held steady since hitting a nearly two-year high in February.
That turning point roughly corresponds to when the Chinese government stepped up a campaign to rein in debt risks through a concerted deleveraging effort, which has driven up borrowing costs.
A Caixin/Markit survey covering China's services sector will be released on Wednesday. The official survey showed the sector remained robust despite a slight slowdown last month.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2017 12:29PM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales rise; Midwest factory activity slows,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rebounded in June after three straight monthly declines, but the housing market remained constrained by a shortage of properties available for sale. 
Other data on Monday showed that factory activity in the Midwest slowed this month after hitting a three-year high in June, with manufacturers reporting declining orders.
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, jumped 1.5 percent, more than double economists' expectations for a 0.7 percent increase. The rise, however, only partially unwound the prior three months' declines.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two. The NAR reported last week that existing home sales, which generally have been running ahead of the signed contracts, fell 1.8 percent in June. 
""In the very near term, the June increase in pending sales suggests that existing home sales will likely increase soon,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But the June increase for the index undid only a portion of the decline reported over the prior few months.""
Silver said he still expected the housing market recovery to continue over time despite recent weakness in some of the data, including homebuilder sentiment. The housing market has been stymied by a dearth of properties, which has pushed up prices and sidelined first-time homebuyers.
Housing contracted in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly seven years and was a drag on economic growth. Homebuilders have been unable to bridge the housing inventory gap, citing rising lumber costs and shortages of land and labor.
REGIONAL MANUFACTURING COOLING
Pending home sales increased 0.5 percent from a year ago. In June, contracts rose 0.7 percent in the Northeast and advanced 2.1 percent in the South. They shot up 2.9 percent in the West but fell 0.5 percent Midwest.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell slightly after the data and the U.S. dollar (DXY) hit a session low against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading mixed and prices of U.S. Treasuries were lower.
In a separate report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management Chicago said its MNI Chicago Business barometer fell to a three-month low of 58.9 in July from a reading of 65.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing in the Chicago area.
The report mirrored other regional manufacturing surveys that have shown softening in activity. Some of the moderation reflects the fading boost from the energy sector after a recent drop in crude oil prices. The Institute for Supply Management will publish its July survey of U.S. manufacturing on Tuesday.
""Regional manufacturing surveys suggest that activity in the factory sector remained solid in July, but growth moderated,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
""We look for a similar message in tomorrow's national ISM manufacturing survey.""The drop in sentiment in the ISM-Chicago survey was broad-based this month. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories fell 11.6 points to a reading of 60.3, the lowest since February. The production index fell 6.9 points to 60.8.
A measure of order backlogs fell 4.9 points from June's 23-year high to a reading of 57.9 in July. Suppliers took slightly less time to deliver key inputs. In response to a special question on wages, over 70 percent of manufacturers said they had increased their workers' salaries over the past year.

A quarter of them said they had kept wages unchanged while 3 percent said they had cut their workers' paychecks.

“The first half of 2017 ended with a nearly identical number of contract signings as one year ago, even as the economy added 2.2 million net new jobs,"" NAR chief economist Larry Yun said.
“Market conditions in many areas continue to be fast paced, with few properties to choose from, which is forcing buyers to act almost immediately on an available home that fits their criteria,” he added.
Yun highlighted that low supply was the ongoing issue holding back activity.
“Housing inventory declined last month and is a staggering 7.1% lower than a year ago,” he explained.
Following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1751 from around 1.1748 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3126 compared to 1.3120 previously, while USD/JPY was at 110.52 from 110.53 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 93.23, compared to 93.24 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets traded mixed after the open. The Dow 30 rose 62 points, or 0.28%, the S&P 500 inched up less than a point, or 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 10 points or 0.14%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,267.72 a troy ounce, compared to $1,266.94 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $49.42 a barrel from $49.27 earlier.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2017 09:58AM ET</span>",Euro zone core inflation unexpectedly picks up in July,"By Francesco Guarascio and Francesco Canepa
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A key measure of euro zone inflation accelerated to a four-year high this month and euro zone unemployment fell to its lowest since 2009 in June, data showed on Monday, in two encouraging signs for the European Central Bank as it considers reducing its monetary stimulus.
The ECB is due to decide by the autumn whether and how to extend its 2.3 trillion euros ($2.70 trillion) quantitative easing program into 2018 and President Mario Draghi has cited sluggish core inflation and wage growth as reasons to be cautious. 
Likely giving heart to ECB policymakers, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, accelerated to 1.3 percent from 1.2 percent in June, Eurostat's flash estimate showed.
It was its highest level since August 2013 and confounded market expectations for a slowdown.
""Today's upside surprise in core inflation is likely to give the ECB some comfort, even though its level remains low,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Daniele Antonucci said. ""We expect a QE tapering announcement this autumn."" 
The European Union's statistics office estimated that headline growth in consumer prices in the euro zone was stable at 1.3 percent year-on-year in July, still far from the ECB's objective of just under 2 percent.
In a separate release, Eurostat said unemployment in the 19-country currency bloc dropped to its lowest level since 2009 at 9.1 percent, confirming a robust recovery in the currency bloc.
The jobless rate also went down in Italy and Spain, the two eurozone countries with the highest rates, excluding Greece for which fresh data were not available. 
In Italy unemployment dropped to 11.1 percent in June from 11.3 percent in May, meaning that nearly 60,000 were added to the Italian workforce. In Spain, the rate fell to 17.1 percent from 17.3 percent. 
One of the ECB's dilemmas is that a steady decline in unemployment is not translating into higher wages, a key driver of inflation.
In Germany, the largest economy of the bloc, unemployment fell to 3.8 percent in June from 3.9 percent the previous month, raising expectations of bigger wage rises that could strengthen growth in the euro zone a whole.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2017 08:08AM ET</span>",Hot and cold: Euro zone grows but inflation slows,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Data in the coming week should confirm the euro zone economy is running hot, after the IMF upgraded growth forecasts and Greece returned to the debt market, although inflation figures could throw cold water on ECB plans to start tightening policy. 
Growth in the single currency area outstripped paltry expansion in the United States and Britain in the first quarter and the pace did not let up in the April-June period.
The euro zone may not be growth champion in the second quarter, after the U.S. rebounded to an annualized 2.6 percent thanks to consumer spending and business equipment investment. But it should again fare better than Britain, whose economy failed to build momentum.
A forecast expansion of 0.6 percent in the April-June period, equivalent to an annualized 2.4 percent, would be the third consecutive quarter in which the euro zone has grown at or above a half percentage point, for the first time since 2007-08.
""The global economy has been a jumbo jet running on just one engine for the last five, six years, the U.S., but now it seems there's more from the euro zone as well, with encouraging signs from Asia too,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
Data on Friday showed the euro zone's second-largest economy, France, grew by 0.5 percent for a third successive quarter, while Spanish GDP returned to pre-crisis levels with 0.9 percent expansion.
""Momentum is there. We're getting a broadening out of countries in terms of economic performance. It's not just the likes of Germany driving it all forward ... There does seem to be self-sustaining momentum,"" said Knightley.
Euro zone economic sentiment, as compiled by the European Commission, grew for a third straight month in July to a new 10-year high due to a pick-up of the dominant services sector. And confidence levels in all sectors, as well as for consumers, are far above historical averages.
The International Monetary Fund has hiked outlooks for China and the euro zone, while trimming those for the United States and Britain. The Fund said the euro zone's recovery was firming and becoming broad-based, with stronger domestic demand, although it warned of downside risks. 
STUBBORN INFLATION, EURO STRENGTH
Political risks seen at the start of the year ahead of elections in France and the Netherlands have diminished, while Greece has returned to the bond market after a three-year exile. 
Five years ago, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro. His ultra-easy monetary policy is partly behind the robust economic recovery, showing more effect this year as growth in bank loans to the private sector hit a 10-year high in May.
Now the question is when to taper. Strong economic growth should steer the ECB towards reining in asset purchases, but policymakers are still waiting on inflation.
The flash estimate for July, due on Monday, is seen stable at 1.3 percent, well short of the ECB's target of just below 2 percent. Perhaps more significantly, the core figure, without volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is seen falling.
""The economy is recovering and the labor market is doing quite well, but we think core inflation will be at 1 percent and below for the rest of 2017,"" said Marco Wagner, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""Except Germany, if you look at France, Italy, Spain or Portugal there are still overcapacities, still relatively high unemployment.""
Among the clearest signs of a rebound has been the euro's pick-up to around $1.17, from $1.05 at the start of the year. UniCredit on Thursday raised its forecast for the euro-dollar rate to $1.20 for the end of the year and an ""equilibrium"" rate of $1.25 for end-2018, from $1.14 and $1.18 respectively before.
""The political risk factor has been taken out,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, co-head of strategy research at UniCredit. ""It would bring the rate in line with our estimate of fair value and in all likelihood the market will overshoot.""
Of course a stronger euro could dampen euro area growth and cap inflation, a further issue for ECB policymakers to consider.
Outside Europe, U.S. monthly jobs data for July on Friday is likely to be the key figure for economists and the Federal Reserve, whose policy-setters next meet on Sept. 19-20.
U.S. job creation surged by more than expected in June and is seen lower but still strong in July, a sign of labor market strength that could keep the Fed on course for a third interest rate hike this year.

More significant may prove to be average wage growth, however. It is seen at 0.3 percent, the highest rate since February, after months of hovering between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.

The annual rate of inflation rose by 1.3% in July, according to a preliminary reading from Eurostat, in line with market expectations, matching June’s final reading.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile components and is seen as a more reliable gauge of inflationary pressures, rose to 1.2% in July from 1.1% in June. Economists had expected a reading of 1.1%. It was the highest reading since August 2013.
The uptick in underlying inflation gives the European Central Bank more leeway to begin scaling back its stimulus program in the autumn.
In a separate release, Eurostat said the unemployment rate in the euro area ticked down to 9.1% in June from 9.2% in May, its lowest level since February 2009 and better than market expectations of a 9.2% rate.
The unemployment rate for May was revised down to 9.2% from the previously reported 9.3%.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's red-hot home prices extended their record-breaking run in June, although the pace of growth slowed, underscoring the challenges the city's new leader faces in reining in prices in one of the world's most expensive property markets.
An apartment of less than 200 square feet can cost as much as $500,000 in the former British colony, making the prospect of owning a home a distant dream for many residents.
Hong Kong's home prices edged up 0.69 percent in June from May, the smallest rise since December last year, according to data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday. From a year earlier, prices surged 21.6 percent.
The record prices come even as Hong Kong's Monetary Authority announced an eighth round of mortgage tightening measures in May to help restrain sky-rocketing prices. Analysts say these curbs could push more people to non-bank lenders, many of them the financing arms of developers.
Hong Kong's new leader, Carrie Lam, who was sworn in on July 1 has pledged to make home prices more affordable. Prices rose 9.3 percent from January to June this year.
Chinese President Xi Jinping also voiced concern over the city's property market when he visited on July 1 to swear in Lam and celebrate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong returning to Chinese rule.
""Housing and other issues that affect the daily life of the people have become more serious,"" Xi said in a speech.
Income inequality is at its highest level in over four decades in Hong Kong, stoking discontent in the city that has been rocked by large-scale protests in recent years over calls for more affordable housing and full democracy.
Senior director at property consultancy Knight Frank, Thomas Lam, said he expects prices to edge up for the rest of the year, but at a slower pace of just 2-3 percent, as some purchasing power had already been absorbed over the past 10 months or so.
""If the rising trend continues, the new administration can be expected to impose more tightening measures,"" Lam said.

Consultancy JLL said in a report this month it expected housing prices, buoyed by strong local demand and tight supply, to rise 15 percent in the coming 30 months.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2017 12:47AM ET</span>",China July factory growth cools but construction boom fortifies economy,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector cooled slightly in July as foreign demand for Chinese goods slackened, but a government-led infrastructure push kept construction humming and helped prop up the world's second-largest economy.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 12th straight month, as China poured funds into a construction boom that has fueled demand for everything from cement to steel and other building materials.
But the broad consensus among China watchers is that economic growth will cool in coming months as a government crackdown on financial risks raises borrowing costs for businesses and squeezes profits.
The official PMI stood at 51.4 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday, down from the previous month's 51.7 and a touch below the 51.6 forecast in a Reuters poll.
Export orders, which helped Chinese factories stage a strong recovery in June, had ebbed this month, with manufacturers reporting slackening foreign demand. Overall factory production expanded less quickly compared with June.
New export orders slipped to 50.9 in July from 52.0 in June, helping drag the index for overall factory orders to 52.8 from 53.1.
""The breakdown suggests weaker foreign demand is partly to blame - the new export orders fell by a larger margin than overall new orders,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a Singapore-based China economist at Capital Economics.
While China's foreign trade faces a mostly positive environment in the second half of the year, uncertainties still exist, Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming said in Beijing on Monday.
The United States and China failed earlier this month to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, casting doubt over President Donald Trump's economic and security relations with Beijing.
Domestically, the construction sector remained robust as the government stepped up investment in infrastructure projects. Separate data showed China's steel sector in rude health, expanding in July at its fastest pace since April 2016.
The PMI reading on the construction sector showed a solid pickup to 62.5 in July from 61.4 in June.
Raw material inventories eased just slightly in July, according to the survey, while imports were almost steady and suggested stable domestic demand.
Activity at large factories gathered steam in July, with the sub-index for big manufacturers rising to 52.9 from 52.7.
COOLER MONTHS
A year-long construction boom helped China post stronger-than-expected economic growth of 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017.
But higher bank funding costs seen in the first half will filter through into the real economy eventually, while the red-hot property market moderates after waves of government cooling measures.
The increase in borrowing costs is expected to hit smaller firms harder. Indeed, a reading on medium-sized and small manufacturers showed activity contracted this month.
Growth in the services sector also cooled in July, falling to 54.5 from a three-month high of 54.9 in June, another official NBS survey found.
China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.
While the PMI data on Monday hinted at a slowdown, Beijing is still expected to meet its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent for the full year - encouraging news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major leadership reshuffle in the autumn.
Markets will now look to the private Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey for July, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms. It is due to be released on Tuesday.
While economists caution against reading too much into the official PMI figures, which can be volatile, ANZ analysts say the infrastructure boost has more to run.

""The slowdown in July PMIs are only temporary, and we may see a rebound in upcoming months. The continuous ascent in prices suggests to us a longer industrial recovery,"" said Betty Rui Wang, ANZ's senior China economist.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rebounded in June from a decline in May as production of cars and industrial chemicals increased, suggesting economic expansion may be on a more stable footing.
Industrial output rose 1.6 percent in June from the previous month, just below the median estimate for a 1.7 percent increase and following a 3.6 percent decline in May.
Manufacturers forecast a steady increase in output in coming months, offering further evidence that firm overseas demand and gains in consumer spending could support overall growth in Japan's economy.
""Overall, the trend looks healthy due to domestic demand and demand from emerging markets, said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""It's safe to say the economy continued its expansion in April-June and the forecasts point to further growth in output.""
Transport sector output rose 4.2 percent in June, rebounding from a 13.0 percent tumble in the previous month, as output of passenger cars and automobile engines recovered.
Output of chemicals rose 3.4 percent in June, also a rebound from a 2.2 percent decline in May.
Inventories across all industries fell 2.2 percent in June, the biggest decline in more than six years, as inventories of cars, steel, and electronic equipment were reduced.
Some economists were concerned that inventories in the past few months were too high, and that companies would have to cut output.
However, the decline in inventories in June shows that companies still have room to expand output, said Mizuho Securities' Miyagawa.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 0.8 percent in July and 3.6 percent in August, which also shows that gains in output are likely to be maintained.
Industrial output rose 1.9 percent in the April-June quarter, handily exceeding the 0.2 percent increase seen in January-March.
Given the close correlation between industrial output and gross domestic product this suggests the overall economy accelerated in April-June.

The positive output reading follows data last week showing the biggest increase in household spending in almost two years and an increasingly tight labour market, building optimism that the economy will maintain its upward momentum.

Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said its survey pointed to moderate growth although there had been some improvement from a month earlier, just after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly failed to win a parliamentary majority in a national election.
""Confidence remains just below the long-term average and is consistent with a moderately positive pace of economic expansion,"" said Hann-Ju Ho, a senior economist for Lloyds.
Last month's poll was based on responses from before and after Britain's June 8 election. It showed a small rise in overall business confidence but a big drop in businesses' assessment of the health of the economy.
That assessment of the economy weakened again when businesses were polled between July 17 and 21, and they said they planned to increase staff numbers by less than before.
Official data last week showed the economy made its slowest start to the year since 2012, with growth of just 0.3 percent in the three months to June compared with the first quarter of 2017, barely half Britain's long-run average growth rate.
With economic growth soft, wages rising only slowing and big uncertainties remaining about how Britain will leave the European Union, the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent on Thursday.
Unemployment in Britain is at its lowest since the 1970s but the Brexit vote in June last year led to a sharp drop in the value of sterling, increasing inflation and eroding consumers' disposable income this year.
The data from Lloyds showed increased optimism among manufacturing and construction firms, echoing other business surveys but which has yet to appear in the official figures. Consumer services companies also did better, but professional services firms reported less good news.
More firms also said they were raising prices. Consumer price inflation hit its highest in nearly 4 years in May at 2.9 percent. Although it has since fallen, many economists expect it to rise again.

Separately on Monday, the Federation of Master Builders said the fall in the exchange rate was causing the prices of materials to soar, squeezing margins for a third of small builders and forcing nearly a quarter to raise prices.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Sanctions imposed by three other Gulf states and Egypt slashed Qatar's imports by more than a third in June while exports excluding its vital shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were also disrupted, official data showed on Sunday.
Imports shrank 40.0 percent year-on-year and 37.9 percent from the previous month to 5.87 billion riyals ($1.61 billion), Ministry of Development, Planning and Statistics figures showed.
In May, imports fell just 0.3 percent year on year.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, which it denies.
The closure of the Saudi border, over which much of Qatar's imports of food, dairy products and construction materials came, as well as a halt to shipping services from the United Arab Emirates, delayed shipments for some days as Doha arranged other routes through centers such as Oman.
Now that alternate shipping routes and suppliers have been arranged, analysts believe Qatar can function fairly well even if the sanctions continue, and still expect it to be one of the Gulf's best-performing economies this year.
The ministry's figures suggested Qatar's exports of LNG - the key to its financial health - were not hurt in June. 
June exports of petroleum gases and other gaseous hydrocarbons climbed 15.8 percent from a year earlier to 11.88 billion riyals. They rose 21.6 percent in May.
However, exports of petroleum oils including crude oil fell 22.4 percent after rising 8.3 percent in May. Non-petroleum exports fell 15.1 percent.
Among exports hit by the sanctions were helium, which used to be shipped overland across the Saudi border. 
Qatar is one of the world's top producers of the gas. Officials say alternative ways to export helium have now been found.

Qatar's June trade surplus jumped to 12.51 billion riyals, up 63.6 percent from a year earlier and up 15.3 percent from May, the data showed.

CARACAS (Reuters) - In a portend of steepening inflation in crisis-stricken Venezuela, money supply surged 10 percent in just one week earlier this month, its largest single-week rise in a quarter of a century.
Venezuela is undergoing a major economic crisis, with millions suffering food shortages, monthly wages worth only the tens of U.S. dollars, and soaring inflation -- though no official data is available.
The central bank said late on Friday the total amount of local currency in circulation -- known as M2 by economists - as of July 21 was 27.3 trillion bolivars, up 9.66 percent from the previous week.
In October 1992, the figure rose 10.84 percent in a single week.
The exponential rise in M2, the sum of cash, together with checking, savings, and other deposits, means an exponential rise in the amount of currency circulating. Venezuela's money supply is up 384 percent in the last year. In contrast, the United States' money supply is up 5.5 percent in the same period.
Coupled with a decline in the output of goods and services, that has accelerated inflation. 
While M2 may seem an obscure technical indicator, the figure was routinely published by newspapers in Venezuela, whose oil-dependent economy has been dogged by inflation in the past.
Venezuelans are forced to carry huge bundles of cash to make basic purchases - if they can afford to do so given weekly price rises on many goods.
This week also saw Venezuela's black market exchange rate surge past 10,000 bolivars per dollar.
When President Nicolas Maduro came to power in April 2013, it was at 24 per dollar.
A thousand dollars worth of local currency then would be worth just over $2 now.
Maduro says he faces an ""economic war"" waged by the opposition and Washington.

The last year for which official inflation data is available from the central bank is 2015, when consumer prices rose 181 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy accelerated in the second quarter as consumers ramped up spending and businesses invested more on equipment, but persistent sluggish wage gains cast a dark shadow over the growth outlook.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June period, which included a boost from trade, the Commerce Department said in its advance estimate on Friday. That was more than double the first quarter's downwardly revised 1.2 percent growth pace.
Wage growth, however, decelerated despite an unemployment rate that averaged 4.4 percent in the second quarter. Inflation also retreated, appearing to weaken the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year.
""Although growth is solid, the lack of wage pressure buys the Fed plenty of time, and works with a very 'gradual' tightening cycle,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York. ""There is more here for the Fed doves than the hawks.""
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data but pared gains as oil prices hit two-month highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street were trading lower following recent hefty gains.
Economists expect the Fed to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September.
The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio ""relatively soon."" The Fed has raised rates twice this year.
The rise in second-quarter GDP was in line with economists' expectations. Output was previously reported to have increased at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter.
The economy grew 1.9 percent in the first half of 2017, making it unlikely that GDP would top 2.5 percent for the full year. President Donald Trump has set an ambitious 3.0 percent growth target for 2017.
While the Trump administration has vowed to cut corporate and individual taxes as part of its business-friendly agenda, Republicans' struggles in Congress to pass a healthcare restructuring have left analysts skeptical on the prospects of fiscal stimulus. So far, the impasse in Washington has not hurt either business and consumer confidence.
CONSUMERS BOOST GROWTH
A resurgence in consumer spending accounted for the bulk of the pickup in economic growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at a 2.8 percent rate. That was an acceleration from the 1.9 percent pace logged in the first quarter.
But with wage growth remaining sluggish despite the labor market being near full employment, there are concerns that consumer spending could slow in the third quarter.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said wages and salaries increased 0.5. percent in the April-June period after accelerating 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
They rose 2.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. There were, however, strong wage gains in the information, finance and natural resources sectors.
""A tightening labor market ought to put upward pressure on wage rates, but employers are likely to resist increases as long as they can, given the state of productivity,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Inflation was subdued in the second quarter. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 0.9 percent rate.
That was the slowest rise in more than two years and followed a 1.8 percent rate of increase in the first quarter.
The gross domestic purchases price index, another measure of inflation pressures in the economy, increased at a 0.8 percent rate after advancing 2.6 percent in the prior quarter.
Businesses helped to carry the economy in the second quarter, with spending on equipment jumping at a rate of 8.2 percent, the fastest in nearly two years. It was the third straight quarterly increase.
Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at a 116.7 percent rate, slowing from the first-quarter's robust 272.1 percent pace. As a result, investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9 percent pace, moderating from the January-March period's brisk 14.8 percent rate.
Though businesses continued to carefully manage their inventories in the second quarter, they spent more in some places. Inventory investment was neutral to GDP growth after slicing 1.46 percentage points in the first quarter.
Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, contributing to output for a second straight quarter.
Housing was a drag on growth in the last quarter, with investment on homebuilding contracting at a 6.8 percent rate, the worst performance in nearly seven years. Auto production slumped for a third straight quarter, while government spending rebounded after declining in the prior period.
Alongside the second-quarter GDP report, the government published revisions to data going back to 2014, which showed little change in the growth picture.

The export surge helped offset a drawdown in company inventories and slower business investment, INSEE said in its preliminary growth estimate for the three months through June.
The result, the third quarter in a row that the euro zone's second-largest economy grew 0.5 percent, was in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 27 economists.
Following the economy's performance over the first half of the year, France should have little trouble meeting and possibly surpassing the government's growth forecast of 1.6 percent.
INSEE estimated the economy has growth momentum of 1.4 percent behind it already, which means that is how strong growth would be for the full year if there were no growth for the rest of the year, which is highly unlikely.
""We expect growth to remain healthy during the second half of the year, boosted by gradually improving labor market situation, muted inflation and solid external demand,"" IHS Markit economist Diego Iscaro.
""Confidence indices suggest that firms and households are also more upbeat about the economic outlook, which should also help to support domestic demand,"" he added.
Business and consumer confidence survey surged in the wake of the election in May of President Emmanuel Macron on a pro-business reform agenda, though they have since eased back.
INSEE said growth in consumer spending accelerated to 0.3 percent in the second quarter after only 0.1 percent the previous quarter while business investment slowed to a rate of 0.5 percent from 2.1 percent as a temporary tax writedown for layouts on equipment expired in April.
Boosted by the delivery of a 700 million euro ($819 million)luxury ocean liner, exports surged 3.1 percent in the quarter, the strongest rate in six years and outpacing by a wide margin import growth of only 0.2 percent as France bought less oil from abroad.
The liner was built at the STX France shipyard which the French government said on Thursday it would nationalize to prevent an Italian takeover. The French move, motivated by strategic defense and job concerns, has angered the Italian government.
Overall foreign trade contributed 0.8 percentage points to gross domestic product in the second quarter and domestic demand added a further 0.4 percentage points.
Meanwhile, companies running down inventories subtracted 0.6 percentage points after a big build-up of stocks the previous quarter.

PARIS (Reuters) - Solid second-quarter growth numbers from France, Spain and Austria on Friday suggest next week's figure for the broader euro zone could surprise on the upside, with German and Spanish inflation data also pointing to robust activity. 
The three countries were the first to venture growth estimates for the April-June quarter before Eurostat releases a preliminary estimate for the euro zone on Tuesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters are on average predicting that the economy of the 19 countries that use the euro will have grown by 0.5 percent from the previous three months.
France on Friday chalked up its third quarter in a row at that pace, putting the euro zone's second-biggest economy on course to surpass a government target of 1.6 percent for the year as a whole -- its best performance in at least six years. 
Figures from the INSEE statistics institute showed the delivery of a massive luxury ocean liner last month boosted French exports, offsetting a drawdown in company inventories and slower business investment.
Though largely welcomed by economists as a solid second quarter performance, French growth pales compared to a recovery in Spain that has brought activity to levels last seen before the global financial crisis that started a decade ago. 
The National Statistics Institute said Spanish growth reached 0.9 percent in the April through June period, improving chances the economy will grow by at least 3 percent in 2017 as the government expects.
Austria meanwhile maintained a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.8 percent in Q2, boosted by exports and investment, according to the Wifo think-tank that compiles data for the government.
Capital Economics' Jack Allen said Friday's growth data suggested the wider euro zone economy would post an expansion of 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
Though Germany does not publish a Q2 growth estimate until mid-August, recent German surveys suggest the euro zone economy could expand by 0.7-0.8 percent, although that pace is unlikely to be sustained over the rest the year, Allen said.
""But we remain optimistic about the outlook -- we think that euro zone GDP will expand by an above-consensus 2.2 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2018,"" Allen said in a research note.
The third quarter also appears to be getting off to a solid start, despite concerns the euro's rise to a 2-1/2-year high against the U.S. dollar could hurt exports. 
The European Commission's monthly economic sentiment indicator (ESI) rose slightly for a third consecutive month in July to a new 10-year high, confounding expectations of a dip from June.
""The fact that the overall ESI went up suggests that for now other forces are dominating any currency impact on growth,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist David Mackie said in a research note.
Other data published on Friday showed Spanish and German inflation slightly topping expectations at 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent respectively while French inflation was in line with estimates at 0.8 percent.
Though the German and Spanish figures were stronger than expected, the fact the German rate was unchanged from last month meant that euro zone inflation due on Monday is likely to be stable at 1.3 percent, Capital Economics Stephen Brown said.

That is still some way below the European Central Bank's target of just below 2 percent, suggesting the data is unlikely to hasten any changes to its massive stimulus program.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that compiles gross domestic product data, said the economy grew 2.9 percent in 2015, an upward revision from the 2.6 percent it had estimated earlier. That was the strongest growth since 2005.
The government's annual GDP revision, which covered data from 2014 through the first quarter of 2017, also showed the economy performing worse than previously estimated in 2016.
The economy grew 1.5 percent last year, a slight downward revision from the 1.6 percent the government estimated earlier. It was the slowest growth since the 2007-09 recession ended.
The revisions to growth in both 2015 and 2016 mostly reflected swings in inventory investment and exports.
Overall, the revisions did not change the economy's picture and confirmed that the current expansion cycle is the slowest on record.

The government will in 2018 publish a comprehensive revision of the GDP series, which will fully address a seasonal quirk that has tended to weigh on first-quarter GDP growth estimates. It hopes that GDP data remain free of the so-called residual seasonality beyond 2018.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2017 05:30AM ET</span>",Euro zone sentiment unexpectedly rises for third straight month,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment rose slightly for a third consecutive month in July to a new 10-year high, against expectations of a dip from June, data released by the European Commission on Friday said.
The sentiment indicator in the 19-country currency bloc rose to 111.2 in July from 111.1 in June and 109.2 in May, driven up by more optimism in the services sector.
The average forecast in a Reuters poll of 29 economists was for a decline to 110.8 after a surge in June to its highest level in nearly a decade.
The figure confirmed the robust recovery of the euro zone, with output expected to grow by another half percentage point in the second quarter after strong expansion in the Jan-March period. The preliminary estimates for output will be released on Tuesday.
Despite the unexpected rise in the sentiment, the Commission's business confidence index, which points to the phase of the economic cycle, fell to 1.05 in July from an upwardly revised 1.16 in June, its highest value since April 2011. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a more modest decline to 1.12 in July.
The rise in the overall indicator of economic sentiment was driven mostly by more optimism in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone's economy, which rose to 14.1 points in July from 13.3 in June, while the manufacturing sector remained at 4.5 points, well above the long-term average of -6.4.
Sentiment among consumers was at -1.7 points in July, also well above the long-term average. It was the same as in June before an upwardly revision to -1.3 points.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months fell to 11.7 in July from 13.0 in June while selling price expectations among manufacturers rose to 7.5 from 7.1 in June.

China's urban registered unemployment rate was 3.95 percent at end-June, compared with 3.97 percent at end-March and 4.05 percent a year earlier, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said on Friday.
The economy expanded a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the second quarter on the back of firmer exports and manufacturing, setting China on course to meet the government's 2017 growth target.
The ministry said 7.35 million new jobs were created in the first six months of 2017. 
In March, Premier Li Keqiang said China added 13.14 million urban jobs in 2016 and aims to add another 11 million this year while keeping the registered unemployment rate below 4.5 percent.
However, structural problems in the labor market remain, ministry spokesman Lu Aihong told a media briefing in Beijing on Friday. 
China's cabinet said in April that risks of mass unemployment in some regions and sectors have increased. 
The government plans to further cut excess and inefficient capacity in its mining sector and ""smokestack"" industries this year as part of efforts to upgrade its economy and reduce pollution.

Resettlement of workers who lose jobs in the coal and steel sectors has been stable and orderly, the ministry said.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 08:30PM ET</span>",Japan household spending jumps most since 2015 in sign of sustainable growth,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending in June jumped the most since 2015 as job availability improved to a fresh 43-year high, in a sign the tightening labor market is helping push up wages and consumer spending - albeit gradually.
Underscoring stubbornly low inflation despite the tightening job market, core consumer prices rose just 0.4 percent in June from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous month and still far below the Bank of Japan's ambitious 2 percent target.
The batch of data points to a steady growth in the Japanese economy, the world's third largest, in the April-June quarter, supporting the central bank's upbeat economic view.
The BOJ last week left monetary policy steady but once again pushed back the timing for hitting its price goal, highlighting the gap between steady growth and weak inflation and reinforcing the view that it will take some time to scale back its massive stimulus.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 1.0 percent at the start of this year, posting a fifth straight quarter of growth on robust exports and a pick-up in private consumption.
Domestic demand holds the key for a sustained expansion as net exports - or exports minus imports - likely trimmed gross domestic product growth in the April-June period, analysts say.
In an encouraging sign for private consumption, which comprises some 60 percent of the economy, household spending rose 2.3 percent in the year to June, up for the first time in 16 months and the biggest annual gain since August 2015.
That compared with economists' median estimate of a 0.6 percent gain in a Reuters poll, data by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed on Friday.
Retail sales also grew 2.1 percent in the year to June, separate data showed.
Firmer consumption data indicates that the tightening job market is helping improve wages and household incomes, which in turn may stimulate consumer spending. 
The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 2.8 percent in June, while the availability of jobs rose for the fourth straight month to hit the highest since February 1974, separate data showed.
Still, Japan's consumer prices are stubbornly weak because of companies' wariness about raising prices for fear of losing cost-sensitive customers, accentuating the challenge facing the BOJ in accelerating inflation towards its 2 percent target.

The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, followed a 0.4 percent gain in May and matched a median market forecast.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 12:55PM ET</span>","U.S. durable goods, trade data boost second-quarter growth estimate","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shipments of key U.S.-made capital goods increased in June for a fifth straight month, suggesting that business spending on equipment helped to boost economic growth in the second quarter.
Signs that the economy gathered speed in the last quarter were also bolstered by other data on Thursday showing a sharp narrowing in the goods trade deficit in June and increases in both retail and wholesale inventories.
The bullish reports came on the eve of the government's advance second-quarter gross domestic product estimate on Friday, prompting economists to raise their forecasts to as high as a 3.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter.
""The economy still has legs in this long expansion from the end of the recession. The only risk we see is that the economy is running out of workers to do the heavy lifting and make us grow,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Commerce Department said shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft increased 0.2 percent after rising 0.4 percent in May. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
But core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.1 percent last month, suggesting equipment spending could moderate in the months ahead. June's drop was the first since December and followed a 0.7 percent jump in May, which was the biggest gain since January. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks rose to new record highs, also cheered by better-than-expected profits from Facebook (O:FB) and Verizon (N:VZ). 
GOODS TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS
The increase in equipment spending has mostly been driven by the energy sector, where oil and gas drilling has increased significantly after declining in the aftermath of the collapse in crude oil prices. 
Momentum is, however, slowing as drilling activity cools. The energy sector recovery is supporting manufacturing by offseting some of the drag from declining motor vehicle production. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
In other data on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit fell 3.7 percent to $63.9 billion in June amid a rise in exports. Goods exports increased $1.8 billion to $128.6 billion last month.
Imports of goods fell $0.7 billion to $192.4 billion. Separately, both retail and wholesale inventories increased 0.6 percent in June. A smaller goods trade deficit and increased stock accumulation are a boost to GDP growth.
However, rising inventories could weigh on economic growth in the coming quarters.
""Stockpiling is not always good news for the economy. If the accumulation of inventories is in anticipation of a quickening demand environment, that is generally positive,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""If it is a result of product simply not moving because demand is drying up, that clearly is not a good signal."" 
While another report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended July 22, layoffs remain low and are consistent with a tightening labor market.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market for 125 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent.
Claims are volatile around this time of the year as automakers shut assembly plants for annual retooling. Some manufacturers like General Motors (N:GM) are extending their summer shutdowns to manage excess inventory from falling sales.
Economists say this could be throwing off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, causing swings in the weekly numbers.

""The song remains the same. Companies are very reluctant to lay off workers, presumably because of the difficulty in replacing them, and the labor market is tight,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in July likely fell a little more than 5 percent from the same month in 2016, a fifth consecutive month of declining sales and the largest monthly drop so far this year despite persistently large consumer discounts, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.
LMC cut its full-year 2017 forecast for new vehicle sales for the fourth consecutive month, to 17.0 million units from its previous forecast of 17.1 million.
July U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.44 million units, a drop of more than 5 percent from 1.52 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 18 selling days of July. Automakers will release U.S. sales results for the month on August 1.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 17.2 million vehicles, down nearly 4 percent from 17.9 million units in the same month in 2016.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were also set to decline more than 5 percent in June.
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly-new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy.
Consumer discounts hit a monthly record of $3,876, above the previous record of $3,597 set in July 2016.
Auto loans of 84 months and longer accounted for more than 6 percent of retail sales for the first time ever, the consultancies said. In order to sell cars in a tougher market, automakers or lenders can resort to longer loan terms in order to bring the monthly payment down for consumers.
Despite the high level of consumer discounts, the average new vehicle sold in July had spent 72 days in inventory. This was the highest level since 2009 during the height of the Great Recession. 
""The second half of the year will continue to present challenges to manufacturers as they navigate a hyper competitive and dynamic marketplace, while working to find the optimal mix of production cuts and discounting necessary to align supply, demand and inventory levels,"" Thomas King, J.D. Power's vice president of PIN OEM operations, media and marketing, said in a release accompanying the sales estimate.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended July 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 241,000.
It was the 125th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent.
Claims have been volatile in recent weeks as automakers shut assembly plants for annual retooling. Some manufacturers like General Motors (N:GM) are extending their summer shutdowns to manage excess inventory from declining sales.
Economists say this could be throwing off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, causing swings in the weekly numbers.
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 244,000 last week. 
Labor market strength likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September and raise interest rates in December for a third time this year, despite a recent moderation in inflation pressures.
The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio ""relatively soon."" 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 13,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended July 15. The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 15 straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.
The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 4,750 to 1.96 million, remaining below the 2 million mark for 13 consecutive weeks. 

The continuing claims data covered the survey period for July's unemployment rate. The four-week average of continuing claims increased 25,750 between the June and July survey weeks, suggesting an uptick in the unemployment rate.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 02:58AM ET</span>","China industrial profits jump most in three months, weather higher financing costs","BEIJING (Reuters) - Earnings for China's industrial firms in June rose at the fastest pace in three months in the latest sign economic momentum in the country remains solid, though analysts expect growth to slow later this year as tighter policies begin to bite. 
Profits surged 19.1 percent in June from a year earlier to 727.78 billion yuan ($107.83 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, accelerating from May even as rising borrowing costs have raised concerns about pressure on margins. 
Statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement that accelerated profits growth in steel, auto and electronics sectors helped to boost overall earnings.
A year-long construction boom in China has lifted earnings for both domestic companies like oil refiner PetroChina to multinational construction equipment maker  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).
Moreover, solid global demand for Chinese goods have helped underpin growth as authorities tighten financial conditions in an attempt to tackle debt risks and reduce the world's second-largest economy's dependence on years of cheap credit. 
""At this stage, companies are still doing well because their sales are still pretty good; they haven't felt the liquidity issue,"" said Nomura's chief China economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong.
For the first half of the year, the firms notched up profits of 3.63 trillion yuan, a 22.0 percent jump from the same period of last year and just a touch slower from the 22.7 percent annual growth in the January-May period.
The robust industrial earnings in June was in part driven by continued appetite for iron ore and other commodities, whose prices have recovered modestly after taking a hit since March.
Chinese policymakers have leaned on property investment and infrastructure spending, including their plan to build a modern ""Silk Road"" trading route, helping fuel a building boom that has boosted demand and prices for materials from steel to cement. 
PRESSURE ON MARGINS, GROWTH?
Analysts expect economic growth to moderate in the year ahead after a solid first half, pressured by a flurry of regulatory measures launched early this year to tackle financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt and defuse a property market bubble.
The measures have raised borrowing rates, a headwind for businesses, particularly those struggling to reduce their debt servicing costs. 
Indeed, NBS's He said ""rising financing costs for companies"" needed to be monitored closely - a point emphasized by Nomura's Zhao. 
""If demand, particularly fixed asset investment demand, slows down due to a cooling property market...then the tightening liquidity will be more felt by companies"", said Zhao. 
Industrial companies' liabilities rose 6.4 percent year-on-year as of end-June, the statistics bureau said, versus 6.5 percent year-on-year through May. 
Profits at China's state-owned firms were up 45.8 percent at 805.5 billion yuan in January-June, compared with a 53.3 percent rise in the first five months. 
China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the second quarter, matching the first quarter's pace, thanks to solid exports, industrial production and consumption. 
The relatively solid economic growth is no doubt welcome news for President Xi Jinping ahead the major political leadership reshuffle in autumn, with authorities keen to ensure a smooth run-up to the meeting. Any sharp drop in industrial profits, a low-risk at this stage, will be a concern for policymakers as it risks rippling across the broader economy.
One sign of the growing pressure on margins is the peaking of factory gate inflation, suggesting profitability and new investment could taper off later this year.
""Looking ahead we still downside risks to profit growth, given the outlook for moderating producer price inflation, financial deleveraging and a cooling property market,"" Zhao said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its massive holdings of bonds ""relatively soon"" in a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy.
The Fed kept its benchmark lending rate in a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, as expected, and said it was on track to continue the slow path of monetary tightening that has lifted rates by a percentage point since 2015.
In a statement following a two-day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank's rate-setting committee indicated the economy was growing moderately and job gains had been solid.
It also noted that both overall inflation and a measure of underlying price gains had declined - trends which have worried some policymakers - but that it expected the economy to continue strengthening.
""The committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon,"" the Fed said, adding that it would follow a plan outlined in June to trim its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
U.S. stock prices rose following the release of the policy statement while yields on U.S. government debt fell. The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies.
After pushing rates nearly to zero to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the Fed pumped over $3 trillion into the economy in a bond-buying spree to further reduce rates. Its balance sheet has grown to $4.5 trillion.
The statement cemented expectations the Fed will announce at its next policy meeting in September the start of its balance sheet reduction plan, marking the end of a controversial tool that drew criticism from Republican lawmakers in Congress.
""The Fed all but told the market the balance sheet run-off will start in September,"" said Brian Jacobsen, an investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
INFLATION JITTERS
Torsten Slok, an economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said the Fed appeared keen to begin balance sheet reduction given the uncertainty over whether President Donald Trump will nominate Fed Chair Janet Yellen for another four-year term.
Trump told the Wall Street Journal this week that Yellen, whose current term expires in February, was among several candidates he would consider to lead the central bank.
While Fed researchers have concluded that bond buying only modestly boosted the economy, Yellen has said the central bank could turn to asset purchases again if the economy fell into a deep rut.
Steady job creation in the economy has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate to 4.3 percent, near a 16-year low.
The Fed had previously signaled it would begin to trim its balance sheet this year.
At the same time, a slowdown in inflation has caused jitters among some Fed officials who are concerned inflation has been below the central bank's 2 percent target for five years.
The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation dropped to 1.4 percent in May from 1.8 percent in February. The Fed had described inflation as being ""somewhat"" below target in its policy statement in June, but on Wednesday it simply stated that it was below 2 percent.

""That, I think, is a signal that it's a slightly more cautious tone,"" said Omer Esiner, an analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington.

In a move largely expected in financial markets, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) agreed to keep its benchmark rate target at 1%-1.25%.
The accompanying statement revealed concerns among policymakers about the recent slowdown in inflation, which remained well below the central bank’s target of 2%.
Inflation data has undershot market expectations for four-straight months, showing little sign of improvement but policymakers remained optimistic that the pace of inflation will stabilise over longer-term.
""Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance,"" the Federal Reserve July policy statement noted.
The Federal Reserve statement also noted that interest rates are likely to remain low for ""some time"", highlighting that increases in its benchmark rate will depend on incoming economic data.
As was widely expected the Federal Reserve held off launching its balance sheet reduction programme but suggested that the Committee would move to normalise its $4.5 trillion balance sheet ""relatively soon"".

272,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2017 12:29PM ET</span>","U.S. new home sales rise in June, but trend softening","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales increased in June as purchases in the West surged to a near 10-year high, but downward revisions to the sales pace for the prior three months pointed to a housing market that is struggling to gain momentum.
New home sales slowed in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year. The housing market is being hampered by a dire shortage of properties, which is keeping home prices elevated and sidelining first-time buyers. 
""We need the housing market to be strong if the economy is to accelerate,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The housing market has been wandering around for most of 2017 and it isn't clear if that pattern will change anytime soon.""
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales gained 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 units last month. The sales pace for March, April and May was revised lower. 
New single-family homes sales in the West soared 12.5 percent to their highest level since July 2007. They jumped 10.0 percent in the Midwest, but fell 6.1 percent in the South. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast.
New home sales, which constitute 10 percent of overall home sales, rose 9.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. They remain less than half of what they were at the peak of the housing market bubble in 2005. 
The slowdown in sales in the second quarter suggests housing was likely a drag on gross domestic product during that period. The sector added almost half a percentage point to the economy's annualized 1.4 percent growth pace in the first quarter.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate for second-quarter GDP on Friday.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS 
The cool-off in housing reflects constraints on supply, rather than demand, amid a strong labor market, which is near full employment. Builders are struggling to keep up with demand amid rising lumber costs and shortages of labor and land. 
Housing starts are running at a 1.22 million-unit pace. That is below their historic average of 1.5 million units, a rate realtors say would eliminate the housing shortage. 
About 70 percent of new homes sold in June were either yet to be built or under construction, highlighting the demand and supply imbalance.
""And this says nothing of the fact that because these homes aren't finished, they won't be move-in ready for months, meaning owners of existing homes that are moving into these new homes will not be in much rush to list their current home and sell to someone else,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.
A report on Monday showed sales of previously owned homes fell 1.8 percent in June. 
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) fell on the new home sales report. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), declined 1.6 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.3 percent. Pultegroup (N:PHM) stock fell 0.4 percent.
With homebuilder confidence dropping to an eight-month low in July, the supply of houses is unlikely to improve.
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home fell 2 percent last week from one week earlier to the lowest level since May.
In June, the inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.1 percent to 272,000 units, the highest level since June 2009. Still, new housing stock is less than half of what it was at its peak during the housing boom. Economists say builders have been concentrating on the construction of expensive homes.

At June's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.3 months in May. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2017 08:25AM ET</span>","Sluggish UK economy inches forward, Bank of England unlikely to act","By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy failed to build much momentum over the past three months after almost stalling at the start of the year, reducing an already slim chance that the Bank of England will soon reverse last year's emergency interest rate cut.
Economic output grew by 0.3 percent on the quarter, edging up from a sluggish rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter, as a booming film industry and bright spots elsewhere in the services sector were largely offset by contractions in manufacturing and construction.
The figure was in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and capped the weakest first half to any year since 2012.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said the economy was ""steady"" and that more certainty about how Britain will leave the European Union in less than two years' time would help spur economic growth.
Sterling edged down against the U.S dollar after the data was released and British share prices rose. 
""To me, this is the final nail in the coffin for an August rate hike,"" said Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank.
Underlining the consumer slowdown, separate figures from trade body UK Finance on Wednesday showed British banks approved the fewest mortgages for house purchase since September 2016 last month, though the total sum lent was the highest since March 2016.
Britain's economy grew 1.8 percent in 2016, among the fastest of the world's seven largest major advanced economies and defying widespread predictions of recession after the vote to leave the European Union.
But the Brexit vote in June 2016 did lead to a big fall in the value of sterling, which has pushed up inflation, gnawing at consumers' disposable income this year.
""The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said.
SERVICES ONLY
The services industry was the only driver of economic growth in the second quarter, helped by retailers, hotels and restaurants, as well as Britain's fast-growing film industry.
The ONS said motion picture activities had grown by 72 percent since 2014, probably boosted by tax credits introduced by former finance minister George Osborne. The release of blockbuster films in the second quarter also helped.
Films entering production in Britain recently include 'M:I 6 - Mission Impossible' starring Tom Cruise, 'Peterloo' directed by Mike Leigh and 'Yardie' directed by Idris Elba, the British Film Institute told Reuters.
'Guardians of the Galaxy 2', 'Wonder Woman' and 'Fast and Furious 8' also generated large box office revenues over the quarter.
Growth between April and June in year-on-year terms fell to 1.7 percent from 2.0 percent in the first three months of the year, in line with economists' average forecast.
The figures are unlikely to alter the analysis of Bank of England officials gearing up to set interest rates next week. Only two out of 80 economists in a Reuters poll published last week thought the BoE would raise rates next Thursday.
In June the central bank said it expected final estimates of GDP to show growth of 0.4 percent in the second quarter.
On Monday the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2017 economic outlook for Britain by more than any other rich nation, predicting growth of 1.7 percent compared with an earlier 2.0 percent estimate. It sees a further slowdown to 1.5 percent in 2018.

The preliminary estimates of GDP do not include a breakdown of spending, and are heavily based on estimated data.

276,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2017 04:32AM ET</span>",UK economy grows 0.3% in second quarter,"Investing.com - Britain’s economy grew in line with expectations in the second quarter, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday.
The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by 0.3% in the three months to June, from 0.2% growth in the first three months of the year. Economists had forecast growth of 0.3%.
On a year-over-year basis the economy expanded by 1.7% from 2.0% in the first quarter, also in line with forecasts.
Britain’s service sector drove growth with output rising by 0.5%, but industrial output shrank by 0.4% and construction output contracted by 0.9%.
ONS Head of National Accounts Darren Morgan said the report showed that Britain’s economy has experienced “a notable slowdown in the first half of this year.”
“While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.”"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices were surprisingly soft last quarter and core inflation rate stayed below target for a sixth straight quarter, a reminder of just why interest rates in the country are at record lows and set to remain there for months to come.
The local dollar slipped a quarter of a cent as the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter and 1.9 percent for the year, well short of the 2.2 percent increase expected.
Underlying inflation rose 0.5 percent in the second quarter, from the first, which matched market forecasts.
The annual rate of 1.8 percent was again short of the Reserve Bank of Australia's long-term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent, where it has been since the start of 2016.
""Obviously the RBA is not going to be happy with these levels. Core inflation has been too low for too long,"" said Tom Kennedy, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). ""The RBA is not going to be thinking about rate hikes anytime soon.""
The protracted period of subdued inflation led the central bank to cut interest rates to a record low of 1.5 percent last year and it has been on hold ever since.
Investors reacted to the inflation news by paring an already slim chance of a hike, with interbank futures implying an 8 percent probability of a move by December.
INFLATION HARD TO FIND
The main price increases last quarter were in health care, taxes on tobacco and the cost of buying a house. Offsetting that were falls in holiday travel, petrol and fruit, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
There are still plenty of headwinds to inflation.
While higher utility charges should add to CPI this quarter, they also act as a tax on consumer spending power at a time when wage growth is already at all-time lows.
Recent gains in the local dollar are also likely to suppress prices for many imported goods, particularly tech products.
The RBA itself doubts inflation will get above 2 percent for another year or more, but is wary of cutting interest rates again for fear of stoking a debt-driven bubble in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.
Neither is it in any rush to hike. Speaking just last week, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle argued there was no automatic reason for Australia to follow some of its peers in tightening.

The global forces keeping rates low would ""continue to do so for the foreseeable future,"" said Debelle, quashing market talk of a hike before year-end.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S consumer confidence jumped to a near 16-year high in July amid optimism over the labor market while house prices maintained their upward trend in May, which could boost consumer spending after recent sluggishness.
The reports on Tuesday underscored the economy's strong fundamentals, expected to keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates for a third time this year.
""This brightens the outlook for the economy as we enter the second half of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We expect Fed officials will continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes secure in the knowledge that a confident consumer means that more spending is on the way.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index surged to 121.1 this month, the second highest reading since 2000, from 117.3 in June. The rise in confidence came despite the healthcare impasse in Washington. The index hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the strongest since 2001. This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with continued reduction in labor market slack.
""That matches up well over time with actual labor market conditions and is a component of the Fed's labor market conditions index,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""The latest gain indicates the unemployment rate is still falling to new lows.""
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent. But the tightening labor market has struggled to generate strong wage growth, a frustration for both households and policymakers.
LESS UPBEAT ON INCOME
The Conference Board survey showed consumers were less upbeat about their income prospects this month. The percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in their income fell slightly to 20.0 percent from 20.9 percent in June.
The share of those expecting a decrease rose to 10.0 percent from 9.3 percent last month. Tepid wage growth has hurt retail sales, which fell in June for a second straight month.
With consumers tightening their purse strings, inflation growth has slowed significantly, leading economists to dial back their expectations for an interest rate hike to December.
Fed officials were scheduled to start a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at the end of that meeting on Wednesday.
Despite the upbeat data, the dollar fell to a 13-month low against a basket of currencies as investors awaited the statement that will accompany the Fed's interest rate decision.
The S&P 500 (SPX) hit a record high, also buoyed by a sets of strong earnings from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and McDonald's (N:MCD).
Retail sales could get a lift from rising house prices, which are boosting household wealth. A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in May on a year-over-year basis after increasing 5.8 percent in April.
An acute shortage of homes on the market and strong demand are pushing up house prices. In another report the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index jumped a seasonally adjusted 6.9 percent in May from a year ago.
That followed a 6.8 percent gain in April. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

""It is very much a sellers' market, so growth is unlikely to slow,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale hit a record high in July as ""euphoric"" manufacturers, shrugging off the impact of a strong euro, anticipated a surge in already robust exports from Europe's biggest economy.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, hit its third record high in as many months with a rise to 116.0 from 115.2 in June.
That beat a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 114.9.
The news will make welcome reading for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in office on Sept. 24. With the economy in rude health, her conservatives are promising full employment by 2025.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said manufacturers were particularly optimistic, with the export sector leading the way. Businesses expected ""exports to rise significantly"", he added.
He said German businesses were experienced in managing exchange rates and not impeded by gains in the euro, which hit an almost two-year high against an ailing dollar on Monday.
""Hardly anything seems to be able to hit the German economy,"" he told Reuters.
The high-end nature of much of Germany's industrial output has made its export sector less susceptible to currency fluctuations than counterparts elsewhere, which often compete more on cost than quality. 
""Sentiment among German businesses is euphoric,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. ""Germany's economy is powering ahead.""
Last year, only just over a third of German exports went to other euro area countries, official figures show.
Comparisons with other euro zone states are hard to assess as export data for the whole bloc runs only to May, when the euro was weaker.
But domestic statistics agency readings from Rome show Italian April-June exports to non-EU countries fell 1.5 pct from the previous three months, the first such decrease since the start of 2016.
RISKS AND CAVEATS
The Ifo sub-index on manufacturing jumped. The construction and wholesaling sectors also saw morale rise, while sentiment fell only in the retail sector.
Underlining the economy's health, German chemicals and pharmaceutical companies association VCI said on Thursday it expected business to continue to do well in the second half of 2017, raising its full-year revenue growth forecast to 5 percent.
But Berenberg bank economist Florian Hense said surveys had exaggerated the underlying strength of Germany's economy in the first half of this year, and he expected growth in the second quarter to have matched the first quarter's 0.6 percent rather than accelerated. 
The Federal Statistics Office publishes preliminary growth data for April-June in mid-August.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Thomas Strobel saw risks to business morale in the month ahead from diesel emissions and cartel scandals in the German auto industry and political tensions with Turkey.
The European Commission said on Saturday that antitrust regulators were investigating a possible auto industry cartel following a tip-off.
But Strobel added that the overall trend was likely to remain upward ""and should continue to benefit German export-dependent manufacturers in the medium term.""
Last week, Germany's ZEW institute said the economic outlook remained positive, despite a fall in investor morale for the second consecutive month in July which economists attributed to the stronger euro.

The International Monetary Fund expects the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell more than expected in June as a dearth of properties amid strong demand pushed prices to a record high, keeping first-time buyers on the sidelines.
The housing market has experienced an acute shortage of homes for sale for about two years. As the labor market churns out more jobs and builders struggle to secure land, building materials and skilled labor, the situation could worsen.
""The fact that demand is so high is actually a good sign of economic health,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. ""But that's probably small comfort to buyers, especially first-time buyers that are having an especially difficult time finding entry-level homes for sale.""The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales dropped 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.52 million units last month.
Economists had forecast sales falling 1.0 percent to a 5.58 million-unit rate. Sales were up 0.7 percent from June 2016. The shortage of properties has led to bidding wars, culminating in house price increases outpacing wage gains.
There were 1.96 million houses on the market last month, down 7.1 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 25 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
The median house price jumped 6.5 percent from a year ago to an all-time high of $263,800 in June. It was the 64th straight month of year-on-year price increases. 
The NAR, however, said the price surge did not suggest another housing market bubble was building, noting that the inflation-adjusted median price was below its peak in 2006.
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) fell 0.3 percent, underperforming a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), slipped 0.20 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) shares fell 0.18 percent, but Pultegroup (N:PHM) stock rose 1.04 percent. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries dipped, while the U.S. dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
Homebuilders are struggling to plug the inventory gap amid rising lumber costs. Homebuilding is also being hampered by shortages of labor and land. 
A report last week showed housing starts rebounding 8.3 percent to a 1.22 million-unit pace in June, but still below their historic average of 1.5 million units, a rate realtors say would eliminate the housing shortage.
Housing likely subtracted from gross domestic product in the second quarter after contributing almost half a percentage point to the economy's annualized 1.4 percent growth pace in the first three months of the year.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate for second-quarter GDP on Friday.
The economy appears to have retained its momentum early in the third quarter, with a second report from data firm IHS Markit showing its flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index hit a four-month high in July.
Home sales in June fell in the Northeast, West and South regions, but rose in the Midwest. At June's sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.2 months in May. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
Houses typically stayed on the market for 28 days last month, down from 34 days a year ago. The shorter market duration was concentrated in Seattle, Salt Lake City, San Jose, San Francisco and Denver. Demand for housing is being driven by a tight labor market, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, which is boosting employment opportunities for young Americans. But the tight labor market has not spurred faster wage growth. 
Annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent, an obstacle for first-time home buyers, whose share of home sales has barely shifted. 
They accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market.

""Housing demand should hold up. However, we are not optimistic that the current inventory shortage will improve this year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""Existing home sales will do no more than tread water over the next few months.""

Annual inflation slowed to 6.28 percent from 6.33 percent in the second half of June, figures from the national statistics institute INEGI showed. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a rate of 6.23 percent.
Consumer prices rose 0.24 percent during the first half of July compared with the previous two-week period, slightly above the poll forecast for an increase of 0.19 percent.
Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens said on July 14 that Mexico was not far from reaching a peak in inflation after the annual rate accelerated to its fastest pace in 8-1/2 years during the month of June.
The closely watched core price index <MXCPIH=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.19 percent in early July compared with the previous half month and by 4.92 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.

Mexico's central bank has hiked interest rates in its last seven meetings. Carstens told Reuters a pause was likely at its next policy meeting in August but that it was premature to talk about rate cuts in the first six to nine months of 2018.

Over 2,500 household items are smaller now than they were in 2012, the Office for National Statistics said in a report on the trend among food producers and other manufacturers of offering consumers less for the same price in response to higher raw material costs.
However, the impact on Britain's official inflation measures was only noticeable for sugar, jams, syrups, chocolate and confectionary, contributing 1.22 per cent to the rate of inflation of sweet items since 2012.
Brits with a sweet tooth might find the news a bit hard to swallow. It comes after cuts over the past year to the size of some of the UK's favorite chocolates, including Toblerone and Mars products such as Maltesers
The ONS also said there was no noticeable change after last year's referendum decision to leave the European Union which hit the value of the pound and made imports more expensive. Shrinkflation existed before the Brexit vote with manufacturers putting it down to the rising cost of raw materials, it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A slowdown in euro zone business growth at the start of the second half of 2017, alongside declining inflation pressures in a key business survey, could put paid to expectations of a stimulus clawback by the European Central Bank later this year.
Years of ultra-easy policy have bolstered still-solid growth, but inflation is nowhere near the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling and even shallower price rises this month will provide disappointing reading for policymakers.
Germany and France, the two largest economies in the club, missed expectations, suggesting an even more robust pace of business activity in many of the bloc's other members.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for July, seen as a good guide to economic growth, fell to 55.8 from June's 56.3, still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
That was below median expectation in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 56.2.
""July's fall in the euro zone Composite PMI suggests that the economy may have slowed a touch at the start of Q3, but probably maintained a decent pace,"" said Jack Allen at Capital Economics.
However, IHS Markit said the euro zone PMI, if maintained, pointed to third quarter GDP growth of 0.6 percent, better than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month. Growth in the last quarter was forecast at 0.5 percent. 
PRICE PRESSURES STILL WEAK
Germany's private sector grew at a slower pace, with the weaker activity due to factory closures for summer holidays following a sustained period of strong growth. French business activity slowed more than expected to a six-month low, though manufacturing sped up.
""Confidence weakened in Germany and France, but we expect some improvement in peripheries - Italy, Spain, Ireland - driven by a rebound in services,"" said Apolline Menut at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The euro hit a 23-month high on Monday against an ailing dollar, although the weaker-than-expected German business activity took some shine off. A stronger currency makes the region's exports less attractive. 
Earlier on Monday, the International Monetary Fund published an upgraded forecast for the bloc, saying growth in the euro zone was now expected to be slightly stronger in 2018 and pointed to ""solid momentum"".
However, the output prices index fell for a second month, dipping to 51.7 from 51.8. its lowest since January. Inflation was just 1.3 percent in June, official data showed earlier this month.
""With the euro zone economy growing at a very decent cruising speed, the lack of selling price growth indicated in the survey seems most worrying for the ECB,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
ECB policymakers see October as the most likely date to decide whether to ease, four sources with direct knowledge of discussions said on Friday, a day after the bank left policy unchanged and did not even discuss easing stimulus.
Activity at firms in the bloc's dominant service industry maintained June's pace, with their PMI holding steady at 55.4. A Reuters poll had predicted a small uptick to 55.5.
New business also remained strong, albeit a little weaker than in June. That sub-index dipped to 54.9 from 55.1.
The manufacturing PMI sank to 56.8 from June's 57.4, missing expectations for 57.2, while an output index which feeds into the composite PMI dropped to 56.9 from 58.7.

However, suggesting factories should remain busy, they built up a substantial backlog of work. The sub-index held at June's 56.1, which was the highest in over seven years.

Financial data company IHS Markit said its monthly Household Finance Index dropped to 41.8 from June's 43.7, its lowest since July 2014, reflecting an ongoing squeeze on household incomes as inflation rises faster than wages.
""There are signs that squeezed household budgets and worries about earnings have started to spill over to consumer spending patterns,"" said Tim Moore, a senior economist at IHS Markit.
Official data due on Wednesday is forecast to show that economic growth picked up only slightly in the three months to the end of June. Analysts polled by Reuters see an expansion of 0.3 percent compared with 0.2 percent in the first quarter - half Britain's long-term average growth rate.
Subdued growth may stay the hand of the Bank of England when it considers next week whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Some policymakers have already called for a rate hike due to worries of persistent price pressures.
IHS Markit said just 27 percent of the households it surveyed expected rates to rise in the next six months, the lowest proportion since October.
The survey also showed that households' willingness to make big purchases fell to its lowest since December 2013.
This tallies with downbeat results from British electrical retailer AO World (L:AO), which reported on Friday that annual sales growth slowing to 2.5 percent in the three months to the end of June, compared with 12.9 percent in the preceding year.
British consumer price inflation reached its highest in nearly 4 years at almost 3 percent in May, before slowing in June. But annual wage growth is less than 2 percent.
""July's survey highlights that the recent moderation in inflationary pressures has yet to provide much relief,"" Moore said.

The reading was an eight-month low, but remained well above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 11th consecutive month.
""The slowdown was driven by stagnation in export orders, amid reports of weaker demand from South East Asia markets,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nonetheless, the sector continues to add jobs, with employment growth remaining amongst the best since the financial crisis.""
The preliminary index for new export orders fell to 50.0 from 53.4 in June.

The index measuring expectations for future output also rose to a preliminary 63.0 in July, which is the highest since Markit began collecting this data almost five years ago.
The Bank of Japan and the government have been upgrading their economic assessments recently due to growing exports, a turnaround in consumer spending and rising capital expenditure.
Private-sector economists have also expressed more confidence in the economic outlook, but the improving outlook has been slow to translate into the acceleration in inflation that the BOJ is hoping for.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's public finances deteriorated in June as rising inflation pushed up the government's debt bill, driving home the challenge for finance minister Philip Hammond who is under pressure to loosen the public purse strings.
Friday's figures showed the rise in prices - fueled by the pound's drop that followed the 2016 vote to leave the European Union - has forced the government to pay more interest on its bonds, around a third of which is linked to inflation.
Britain's budget deficit in June stood at 6.854 billion pounds ($8.92 billion), up 43 percent compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics, citing figures that exclude state-controlled banks.
The shortfall for June was much bigger than a median forecast of 4.8 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
In the first three months of the financial year, the budget deficit widened by 8.9 percent compared with the same period in 2016 to 22.8 billion pounds, the ONS said.
""Today's figures illustrate the challenges confronting (Hammond) to manage the public finances, as he is faced with a double whammy of slowing growth and rising inflation on one side and calls for greater expenditure on the other,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
Hammond has come under pressure from within the ruling Conservative Party as well as from the opposition Labour Party to loosen his grip on public spending, chiefly by relaxing a cap on pay for public workers.
Spending on debt interest jumped an annual 33 percent to 4.9 billion pounds, the highest for any month of June since 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in inflation which has pushed up the cost of index-linked bonds for the government.
Retail price inflation, the benchmark for these bonds, is running at a more than 5-year high.
ON TRACK?
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has predicted the budget deficit will amount to around 58 billion pounds by the end of the current financial year 2017/18, roughly 25 percent higher than in 2016/17.
Despite a disappointing June, Hammond looks broadly on track to meet that goal, helped by the deficit in the previous financial year totaling 5 billion pounds less than the OBR assumed in March, PwC chief economist John Hawksworth said.
June's deficit was also widened by higher payments to the European Union budget and bigger purchases of goods and services by the government.
Britain has been struggling to fix its public finances since the budget deficit surged to around 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 after the global financial crisis.
Since then it has been cut steadily to 2.4 percent of GDP in the 2016/17 financial year which ended in March, its smallest since before the financial crisis.
But the deficit is expected to widen again to 2.9 percent GDP this year when Hammond will have fewer one-off factors to help him than last year.

He is sticking to his plan to balance the budget by the middle of the next decade although he has some room for maneuver, allowing him to spend more if needed to support the economy as the country leaves the European Union.

Core consumer prices were seen likely to maintain a moderate increase in June led by energy costs, but the prices of other items were expected remain soft - emphasizing the economy's lack of inflationary pressure. 
The poll showed household spending was expected to grow 0.6 percent in June from a year earlier with retail sales seen rising 2.3 percent for the month.
""Consumer spending is picking up as higher share prices helped consumer sentiment and wages were relatively good,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There is a high chance consumer spending will contribute positively to economic growth in April-June.""
Japan's economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in January to March and analysts see the economy continuing to grow in the April-June quarter. GDP data is due mid-August.
The poll found that Japan's unemployment rate was seen likely to fall to 3.0 percent in June from 3.1 percent in May, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen at 1.5, the highest level since February 1974.
""The economy is recovering and firms' labor shortages remain severe. So the jobless rate could go back to below 3.0 percent again in coming months,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The poll forecast the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, would rose 0.4 percent in June from a year ago, unchanged from May.
The internal affairs ministry will announce the CPI, employment data and household spending data at 2330 GMT on Thursday (8:30 a.m. on July 28 Japan time). The trade ministry will issue the retail sales at 2350 GMT the same day.
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday but once again pushed back the timing for achieving its ambitious inflation target, reinforcing views it will lag well behind other major central banks in scaling back its massive stimulus program.

The EU bought 44 percent of Britain's good and services exports in 2015 and many employers are worried about the risk of new barriers to trade with the bloc after Brexit. 
""Wait-and-see is not really an adequate strategy for exporters,"" said Clive Higglesden, a banker from a division of Lloyds that provides services to firms selling overseas. ""Businesses should be acting now to manage any risks on the horizon and possibly explore new opportunities.""
Britain's government has urged companies to find fresh markets as it prepares to leave the EU in 2019, and trade minister Liam Fox angered business leaders last year by saying some would rather play golf than seek out new foreign customers.
On Thursday Fox said a bespoke trade deal between Britain and the EU should be ""one of the easiest in human history"" to reach - though he added that Britain could manage without one if necessary. Sterling fell in response.
Of the more than 1,000 exporting firms surveyed by polling firm YouGov for Lloyds, 85 percent send exports to the EU and the bloc was the main market for 54 percent of them. 
Twenty-seven percent of the companies that said they had reviewed their export strategies said they planned to look for trade opportunities outside the EU. But 30 percent said they intended to focus on the domestic market instead of exports.
Lloyds said that could leave companies more exposed to the ups and downs of Britain's economy.
The survey was conducted between May 23 and June 19 and around 90 percent of the firms which took part had annual turnover of less than 750 million pounds ($972 million). 
A separate survey published on Thursday showed barely one in 10 British companies has started to put Brexit contingency plans into effect because many firms remained unclear about what leaving the EU would mean.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, touching its lowest level in nearly five months, suggesting strong job gains that should continue to underpin economic growth.
Sustained labor market strength likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates for a third time this year and announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, despite a recent ebb in inflation pressures. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended July 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the lowest level since February, when claims fell to 227,000, which was the best reading since March 1973.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 245,000. It was the 124th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent. Last week's drop in claims unwound the recent increase which economists had attributed to volatility associated with different timings of automobile plant shutdowns for annual retooling.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250 to 243,750 last week. 
Prices for U.S. government bonds pared earlier gains following the data, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. 
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for July's non-farm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 1,250 between the June and July survey periods, suggesting strong job gains in July.
The economy created 222,000 jobs last month, the second biggest payrolls increase this year.
Other data on Thursday showed a moderation in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region in July amid a tepid increase in orders received by factories. 
The Philadelphia Fed said its current business conditions index fell to a reading of 19.5 this month, the lowest since November, from 27.6 in June.
Thirty-seven percent of the firms surveyed reported increases in activity in July, down from 42 percent last month. The survey's new orders index fell 24 points as nearly 31 percent of factories reported a rise in new orders, down from 45 percent in June. 

While manufacturers reported overall increases in factory employment this month, the current employment index fell five points. The index has been positive for eight consecutive months. Seventeen percent of manufacturers reported an increase in employment this month, while 6 percent reported a decrease.

The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 15 decreased by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 248,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 3,000 to 245,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 243,750, down 2,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 8 inched up to 1.977 million from 1.949 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to dip to 1.950 million.

Specifically, the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.0%, in line with forecasts.
The central bank also held its deposit facility rate steady at -0.4% and its marginal lending rate remained at 0.25% as expected.
Additionally, the ECB also confirmed, as previously announced, that the size of its monthly quantitative easing program would continue at the new monthly pace of €60 billion ($65.4 billion) until the end of December 2017, “or beyond, if necessary”.
“The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” the statement repeated.
The arguably most-watched phrase of the ECB statement maintained that the euro zone monetary authority was still contemplating the possibility of increasing accommodation if necessary.
“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the program in terms of size and/or duration,” it reiterated, confirming that the ECB remains open to further easing if economic developments so require.
After the decision, traders looked ahead to ECB president Mario Draghi’s press conference at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
Market participants will pay close attention to any hints Draghi may give on future path of monetary policy with particular regard to the removal of accommodation, although most analysts believe that he will likely wait until the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium near the end of August to pre-announce intentions for the September 7 meeting.
After the announcement and ahead of Draghi, the euro weakened. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1485 from around 1.1493 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8877 from 0.8880 earlier.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone first quarter deficit falls to decade low, Germany widens surplus","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone's public deficit dropped in the first quarter of the year to its lowest level in nearly a decade, driven by a widening surplus in Germany and despite France's increasing fiscal gap, data released on Thursday showed.
The figures, published by the European Union's statistics office Eurostat, confirmed the improving state of the bloc's public finances, although public debt increased in the first quarter driven by a further expansion of Italy's debt, the second largest in the 19-country currency bloc.
Eurostat said that government deficit in the euro zone dropped to 0.9 percent of output in the first quarter of the year from 1.1 percent in the previous quarter, confirming a long-lasting downward trend.
It was the lowest level of public deficit since the last quarter of 2007, when the global financial crisis began hitting euro zone's economies forcing higher public spending to prop up the financial sector.
The fall in the bloc's fiscal gap was helped by Germany's thrift, as the bloc's largest economy further expanded its surplus to 1.5 percent of output in the first quarter from 1.4 percent in the last quarter of 2016, and 0.7 percent in the third quarter of last year.
The widening of the surplus goes against calls on Germany from other euro zone countries and European Union institutions to increase spending and rise wages to help strengthen the bloc's recovery.
France, the euro zone's second largest economy, instead saw an increase of its government deficit in the first quarter to 3.3 percent of output from 3.2 percent in the previous quarter.
The figure was above a 3 percent limit set by EU fiscal rules, but French President Emmanuel Macron and his government have repeatedly pledged that they will bring the annual deficit below the 3 percent threshold this year.
The drop in the euro zone deficit was offset by an increase of the bloc's public debt to 89.5 percent of output in the first quarter from 89.2 percent in the last quarter of 2016, above an indicative limit of 60 percent required for euro zone countries by EU fiscal rules.
The increase was partly due to the expansion of debt in Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone. Rome's debt, already the second highest in the bloc, grew to 134.7 percent of output in the first quarter of the year from 132.6 percent in the previous quarter.
In Greece, which has the euro zone's highest debt, Eurostat recorded a drop in the first quarter to 176.2 percent of output from 179 percent in the last quarter of 2016.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's labor market strengthened for a fourth month in June led by a remarkable comeback in full-time jobs - an upbeat outcome that could bring nearer the day when the country's central bank starts considering a rate hike.
The data will offer much-needed relief to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has been fretting over a ""mixed"" jobs performance while leaving interest rates at a record-low 1.50 percent since last August.
Thursday's data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the unemployment rate steadied at 5.6 percent as 14,000 new jobs were added.
The gain in employment was led solely by a jump in full-time work, which has risen by 115,400 positions in the past two months – the strongest back-to-back increase in 29 years, and a dramatic turnaround on 2016 when full-time jobs actually fell by 23,100.
""That's a sign of strength in the labor market,"" said AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver. ""For those looking for an imminent rate hike by year end, it supports their case.""
Thursday's labor data coincided with a measure of business conditions jumping to its highest level since early 2008 in the June quarter. Firms also reported an increase in labor costs and hiring intentions.
The Australian dollar rose briefly on the data, but was rebuffed by stiff chart resistance at 80 U.S. cents. It was last at $0.7942, and up a hefty 1.4 percent for the week.
AMP's Oliver and some other economists are not convinced the time is ripe for a rate increase because they see plenty of spare capacity in the labor market.
The underemployment rate, which measures people wanting to work more hours, was still near record highs while the participation rate edged up in June as more people went looking for jobs.
That is likely to keep a lid on wages growth which is languishing at an all-time low, and put downward pressure on inflation which remains below the RBA's 2-3 percent target band.
Still, the RBA was confident of a turnaround in the economy with the labor market showing signs of life together with a pick up in business investment, minutes of its July policy meeting showed earlier this week.
The minutes also revealed that board members discussed the estimated neutral policy interest rate - which neither stimulates the economy nor retards it - pegging it at 3.5 percent.
Overall, that was interpreted by some in the market as a hawkish message.
Asked on radio about the prospect of rates rising to 3.5 percent, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull implied a message was being sent.

""They're not saying that they're going to do that tomorrow but I think they're sending a signal which is probably prudent, which is to say: 'Ladies and gentlemen just be aware rates are more likely to go up than go down.'""

In a widely expected move, the BOJ maintained the 0.1 percent interest it charges on a portion of excess reserves that financial institutions park at the central bank.
At the two-day policy meeting that ended on Thursday, it also kept its yield target for 10-year Japanese government bonds around zero percent.
In a quarterly review of its long-term projections, the central bank cut its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year ending in March 2018 to 1.1 percent from 1.4 percent projected three months ago.
The BOJ delayed the timing for achieving its 2 percent inflation target, saying it would be met sometime during fiscal 2019. In April, it had projected inflation would hit 2 percent in fiscal 2018.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

310,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2017 09:53PM ET</span>",Japan's June export growth points to sustained economy recovery,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose for a seventh straight month in June led by shipments of cars and electronics, an indication external demand continues to support a gradual economic recovery and backing the central bank's upbeat economic view.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday that exports grew 9.7 percent year-on-year in June, versus a 9.5 percent annual gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a 14.9 percent year-on-year rise in the previous month.
The data comes hours before the Bank of Japan ends a two-day rate review, at which it is expected to raise its growth forecasts as robust exports and private consumption heighten prospects of a moderate economic recovery.
However, the central bank is also likely to cut its price forecasts and hold off from expanding stimulus, highlighting a gap between strong growth and weak inflation.
Some analysts say net exports - or exports minus imports - may have trimmed gross domestic product growth in the April-June period as the pace of export growth likely slowed from the previous quarter while imports surged.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.0 percent at the start of this year, posting a fifth straight quarter of growth. Whether it can extend gains depends on the strength of domestic demand, which has been a soft spot in the world's third largest economy, they say.
""The economy likely expanded for a sixth straight quarter in April-June as private consumption and pubic investment probably turned out strong,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
By destination, Japan's exports to the United States rose 7.1 percent in June from a year ago, posting a fifth straight month of gains, due to increased shipments of cars.
The trade surplus with the United States fell 4.9 percent to 587.4 billion yen ($5.25 billion) due as imports jumped 19.3 percent in the year to June, led by crude oil and coal.
Japan's trade surplus has been a target of criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has called for cutting U.S. trade deficit and boosting exports under his ""America First"" protectionist policies.
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, increased 19.5 percent year-on-year in June, led by shipments of car parts and semiconductor production equipment.
In terms of volume, Japan's overall exports rose 4.0 percent, up for a fifth consecutive month.
Japan's imports rose 15.5 percent in the year to June, versus the median estimate for a 14.6 percent annual gain, led by coal and liquefied natural gas, bringing the trade balance in a surplus of 439.9 billion yen.

The quarterly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a reversal from the first quarter, which saw growth accelerate at its strongest pace since the June 23, 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union.
A net balance of 21 percent respondents reported an increase in total workload in the second quarter, down from 27 percent recorded in the previous quarter, RICS said.
The private commercial and industrial segments felt the sharpest slowdown.
The UK property market has been one of the most prominent casualties of the Brexit vote, with many developers tempering construction plans to reduce the risk on the books and given widespread concern that companies will rent less space.
Banks have tightened lending criteria as well, making it tougher for smaller builders or those with limited funds to start new projects.
The UK RICS Construction and Infrastructure Market survey showed that financial constraints, due to economic uncertainty driven largely by Brexit and the subsequent election, was noted as the most significant impediment to building activity.
The survey said 79 percent of all respondents cited it as a concern, marking the highest level in four years. Other reasons included difficulties with access to bank finance and credit and cash flow and liquidity challenges.
""Economic and political uncertainty appear to be weighing on sentiment, but all things considered, current conditions and year-ahead workload expectations are holding up rather well relative to the longer-term trend,"" said Jeffrey Matsu, Senior Economist at RICS.
""Given the ongoing nature of Brexit negotiations, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on financial conditions,"" he added.

The primary fiscal deficit was 103 billion pesos in the second quarter, compared with 41 billion pesos in the first quarter.
For June, Argentina posted a primary fiscal deficit of 57 billion pesos, compared with 27 billion pesos in May. 
The primary budget balance, which measures government spending relative to income and does not include debt payments, is followed by the markets as an indicator of Argentina's ability to meet its financial obligations.
Cutting the fiscal deficit of Latin America's No. 3 economy is a key priority for business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December 2015. The government is aiming to cut the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 3.2 percent in 2018, compared with 4.6 percent in 2016.
Dujovne said there was ""no doubt"" that the country would meet its annual goal this year. He pointed to a 32 percent increase in government revenue in the first half of the year as ""consistent with the reactivation observed in the economy."" 
Argentina's economy shrank 2.2 percent in 2016, but emerged from a deep recession to post modest growth in the final two quarters of last year. The economy has expanded 0.4 percent in 2017 through April compared with the same period last year, according to government data. 
The total financial result, which includes payments on the public debt, was a deficit of 92 billion pesos in June, up 26.5 percent from the same month last year. In the first half of the year, the deficit including interest payments was 256 billion pesos, up 43 percent from the year-ago period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding surged to a four-month high in June, but construction activity remains constrained by rising lumber prices and labor and land shortages.
June's better-than-expected increase in housing starts ended three straight months of declines, offering hope that investment in homebuilding was only a modest drag on economic growth in the second quarter.
""A lack of workers is limiting the ability of builders to build, and input costs are also an issue,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""I don't expect this part of the economy to add greatly to growth going forward.""
Housing starts jumped 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the highest level since February, as both single-family and multi-family construction rebounded after a recent slump, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. 
May' s sales pace was revised up to 1.12 million units from the previously reported 1.09 million units. 
Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a 1.16 million-unit rate last month. Starts rose 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
Building permits shot up 7.4 percent to a 1.25 million-unit rate in June, with approvals for the single-family housing segment snapping a three-month losing streak. Permits for multi-family homes construction surged to a five-month high.
Despite last month's surge, homebuilding has lost momentum after strong gains in both the fourth and first quarters. 
Starts are below their historic average of 1.5 million, a rate realtors say would eliminate an acute shortage of houses on the market, which has driven up prices.
""We expect the bidding wars to continue for the foreseeable future in many inventory-starved housing markets,"" said Joseph Kirchner, senior economist at Realtor.com. 
Supply bottlenecks are blamed for the slowdown. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders hit an eight-month low in July amid complaints about high lumber prices and shortages of building lots and labor. 
Lumber prices have surged after the government in April imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
The PHLOX housing index (HG) rose 0.60 percent on the homebuilding data, outperforming a modestly higher U.S. stocks market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:HIG), climbed 0.24 percent and Pulverous (N:JPM) advanced 0.86 percent. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. 
BROAD GAINS
The Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its second-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate after the data. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.3 percent to an 849,000 unit-pace last month, also a four-month high.
The sector has lost ground since vaulting to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, despite strong demand for housing, which is being driven by a labor market that is near full employment. 
A separate report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to purchase a home rose 1 percent last week.
Single-family starts increased in the Northeast, South and West. They, however, fell in the Midwest. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment increased 13.3 percent to a 366,000 unit-pace, after five straight months of declines. Construction has slowed amid a jump in multi-family homes coming on the market.
Building completions surged 5.2 percent in June to their highest level since November 2016. Completions of multi-family buildings with five units and more soared 17.9 percent also to a seven-month high. There were 601,000 multi-family home units under construction in June.

""The rising supply has been boosting vacancy rates and slowing rent gains in major markets in the past couple years,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""That should result in a somewhat slower trend pace of multi-family starts.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' and service providers' business confidence held steady at high levels in July, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday, underlining the central bank's upbeat view on the economy.
Manufacturers' sentiment stood at a decade-high peak and service-sector mood maintained its two-year high, offering further evidence of broadening confidence.
Sentiment was likely to hold largely steady over the next three months.
The readings in the Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - should be encouraging to the central bank, which is set to offer a more upbeat view of the economy this week than it did in June.
At a two-day rate review that ends Thursday, the BOJ is seen likely to keep monetary policy steady even as it cuts its inflation forecast, people familiar with the matter say, underscoring the challenge it faces in using monetary stimulus to lift prices.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 26 in the poll of 549 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between June 30 and July 13, in which 266 companies responded. The index matched the readings recorded in April and June, which were the highest since August 2007, just before the global financial crisis. It was seen improving to 28 in October.
""Japan's economy as a whole is on the upswing, and the local economy is not bad. In addition, we have built overseas bases in Southeast Asia over the last 15 years. Japanese-owned businesses in our overseas markets are increasingly calling out to us now,"" a manager of an electrical machinery maker wrote in the survey.
A textile maker wrote: ""Sales in our businesses are solid as currencies, raw materials and fuel prices are moving as expected, and as the global economy centring on the United States and China remains in an expansionary trend.""
The Reuters Tankan service-sector index hovered at 33, unchanged from June's reading, which was the highest level since mid-2015. It was seen slipping to 31 in October.
The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

The BOJ's last tankan out July 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter, providing further evidence that the recovery in the world's third largest economy is gaining momentum.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 01:10PM ET</span>","UK inflation surprises with slowdown, easing pressure on Bank of England","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly slowed last month for the first time since October, dousing expectations among investors that the Bank of England might soon raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Consumer prices rose by 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, down from a nearly four-year high of 2.9 percent in May.
Economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged and some of them trimmed their forecasts for price growth to just below 3 percent in 2017 as a whole after Tuesday's figures.
But BoE Governor Mark Carney said the ""big picture"" for inflation remained the same and the main driver was still the fall in sterling since last year's Brexit vote.
""That's what's pushing inflation up, and inflation will be above target for a period of time and today's figures are consistent with that,"" he told Sky News.
Sterling lost half a cent against the U.S. dollar and British government bond prices jumped as the figures suggested the BoE was under little pressure to raise rates when it next meets in early August, despite concerns among some of its policymakers about rising prices.
The fall in inflation was the sharpest between any two months since February 2015, reflecting a fall in global oil prices, and slowing price pressure in factories.
""This is going to kill the chances of a rate rise in the short term. We will learn more about the Bank of England's thinking in a couple of weeks, but we can expect the calls for a rate rise to reduce to a whimper,"" Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at fund managers Aberdeen Asset Management, said.
However, many economists have said they expect inflation to pick up again soon, adding to the strain on households which are seeing salaries rise more slowly than prices.
""There's lots of pressure still in the tank,"" Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said.
Britain's inflation rate has risen sharply since last year's referendum decision to leave the European Union which pushed down the value of the pound, making imports more expensive.
BOE LIKELY TO REMAIN PATIENT
The BoE has been taken by surprise by the speed of the increase this year. Its most recent forecasts saw inflation peaking at 2.8 percent later in 2017 while most economists have said they expect inflation to reach at least 3 percent.
The BoE did accurately predict that inflation in June would be 2.6 percent.
The BoE has so far chosen not to respond by raising rates, saying the Brexit hit to the pound is likely to be temporary.
However, three of the eight BoE rate setters voted to raise rates in June. One of the dissenters has since left.
Carney has said a rate hike would probably be needed if the economy overcomes its slowdown of earlier this year and wages - which are lagging behind inflation - grow more strongly.
The BoE announces its next decision on rates on Aug. 3.
A Reuters poll of economists showed the BoE was expected to keep rates on hold throughout 2017 and 2018.
The ONS said inflation was pushed down by fuel prices after a fall in global oil prices and a partial recovery in the value of the pound last month. A drop in the cost of computer games and equipment, which rose in May, was also a factor.
Data on factory gate prices suggested that the most intense pressure on consumer prices is easing. Output prices rose at their slowest rate since December of last year, up 3.3 percent.

Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose at their slowest rate since September, up 9.9 percent on the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell for a second straight month in June amid further declines in the cost of petroleum products, suggesting inflation could remain benign in the near term.
Import price pressures are, however, likely to pick up given the recent weakness in the dollar, which has declined 6.1 percent in value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year. 
""The focus should be on the dollar,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""If a stronger dollar represented tighter financial conditions and a disinflationary impulse, a weaker dollar implies looser conditions and an inflationary impulse.""The Labor Department said on Tuesday that import prices decreased 0.2 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices increased 1.5 percent. That was the smallest gain since last November and followed May's 2.3 percent increase. 
The year-on-year increase in import prices has slowed sharply since posting 4.7 percent in February, which was the biggest advance in five years. 
Import prices excluding petroleum edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged the prior month. They have stabilized since falling last October, reflecting the dollar's depreciation, and increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through June.
The report followed data last week showing consumer prices unchanged in June and the annual CPI rate increasing 1.6 percent - the smallest rise since October 2016. 
The dollar has been hurt by the benign inflation outlook and diminishing expectations of a fiscal stimulus from Washington after Republicans in the U.S. Congress struggled with healthcare reform. Political scandals surrounding President Donald Trump are also seen impeding his pro-growth agenda.
The dollar fell to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading down.
TEMPORARY FACTORS
Low oil prices are largely curbing both domestic and imported inflation pressures. Other factors such as declining prices for mobile phone services have also contributed to pushing inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that the recent ebb in inflation was partly the result of ""a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices"" that would eventually drop out of the calculation.
""Expectations for a weakening U.S. dollar should pressure nonfuel import prices higher, supportive to the Fed's projection that inflation will gradually climb in the second half of the year,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Persistently low inflation will likely have an impact on the timing of a third interest rate increase this year from the U.S. central bank, which most economists expect would be in December.
Last month, prices for imported petroleum fell 2.2 percent after decreasing 1.2 percent in May. Imported petroleum prices have not risen since gaining 0.8 percent in February.
Prices for imported capital goods rose 0.2 percent, the largest increase since May 2014, while motor vehicle prices fell 0.2 percent. The cost of imported food increased 0.9 percent. 
The report also showed export prices dropped 0.2 percent in June as falling vegetable, soybeans and fruit prices weighed on agricultural exports, after falling 0.5 percent in May. 

They rose 0.6 percent year-on-year, the smallest gain since prices started rising in December, curbed by lower export prices for soybeans, fruit and corn. Export prices gained 1.5 percent in the 12 months through May.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>",Industrial recovery drives China's second-quarter GDP as consumption slows,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A pick-up in the industrial sector helped China post better-than-expected second quarter economic growth as finance and real estate expansions slowed to multi-year lows, data showed on Tuesday.
That is likely welcome news for Chinese officials that have been trying to tamp down an overheated property market and speculation in financial markets in favor of investment in the real economy and upgrades of China's massive industrial sector.
But a continued slowdown in consumption growth this year could present an ongoing challenge to China's efforts to shift to a consumer-led economy.
The industrial sector, which accounts for about a third of the economy, grew 6.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, data from the statistics bureau showed on Tuesday. That was up slightly from 6.5 percent in the first quarter and the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.
The real estate sector, meanwhile, only expanded 6.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest since the end of 2015, and down significantly from 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter, as government curbs dragged on the sector.
Finance sector growth also decelerated to its slowest pace since the third quarter of 2004, after clocking 3.2 percent growth in the second quarter from 4.4 percent in the first quarter.
On Monday, China reported second quarter growth <CNGDP=ECI> of 6.9 percent, unchanged from the first quarter and setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target.
Despite private surveys showing small firms struggling amid weaker demand and greater competition, the statistics bureau said the performance of small and micro businesses was relatively stable in the first half of 2017.
A survey showed that business confidence among small and micro companies rebounded to a nearly two-year high in the second quarter on more orders and a better financing environment, NBS official Zhao Yuncheng wrote in a commentary.
That is in contrast to a long-running survey by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) showing business activity for smaller Chinese firms hit the lowest in 16 months in June.
CONSUMER SPENDING GROWTH SLOWS
While policymakers continue to trumpet China's shift to a consumer-oriented economy - it contributed the lion's share of growth in the first half - data from NBS showed real growth in per capita consumer spending of 6.1 percent in the first half was the slowest since the data was first published in 2014.
Second quarter growth of the consumer-driven retail and catering/accomodation sectors was the slowest since the third quarter of last year at 7.1 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively, the data showed.

Europe's biggest economy is set for solid expansion in 2017 after growing by 0.6 percent in the first three months, driven by strong private investments, solid household spending and rebounding exports.
""Our overall assessment of the economic development in Germany remains unchanged compared to the previous month,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
""The outlook for the German economic growth in the coming six months continues to be positive,"" he added.
The Mannheim-based research institute said its monthly survey among German investors showed that economic sentiment deteriorated to 17.5 from 18.6 in June. This undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 18.0.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions dropped to 86.4 from 88.0 last month. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast predicting a stable reading.
VB Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel attributed the drop to possible currency effects.
""German exporters don't like the prospect of a stronger euro. If the euro is rising, export goods become more expensive on world markets,"" Gitzel said.
The euro has risen above 1.1530 dollar <EUR=>, a fresh 14-month high, ahead of the next European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday.
The Economy Ministry said last week that the economy will continue to enjoy solid growth in the second quarter, driven by soaring private consumption and higher construction activity while net foreign trade is unlikely to add to the expansion.
Analysts expect Germany's gross domestic product to grow by at least 0.6 in the April-June period. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary second quarter GDP growth figures in mid-August.

The International Monetary Fund expects the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms and by 1.6 percent in 2018.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 04:54AM ET</span>","China's property market slows, Beijing prices down for first time since 2015","By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices in Beijing fell for the first time in more than two years in June, while Shanghai declined further and Shenzhen stalled, pointing to significant cooling in China's biggest real estate markets, official data showed on Tuesday. 
Nationwide, home price growth slowed slightly last month as government restrictions to keep prices in check weighed on larger cities, though smaller cities maintained rapid growth due to less severe checks. 
Big cities such as Beijing have acted swiftly this year to quell speculative property buying that have shattered price records and fueled concerns about housing affordability.
Worries about growing household leverage have been joined by anxiety over China's addiction to debt, which authorities have been trying to curb over the past year in an effort to defuse financial risks. 
The latest data suggests the real estate sector is cooling off at a moderate pace and is unlikely to suffer a steep correction as some had feared.
In June, average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 10.2 percent from a year earlier, decelerating from May's 10.4 percent gain, according to Reuters calculations based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
On a monthly basis, new home prices rose 0.7 percent in June, the same as the previous month's reading, the calculations showed.
""Sales declines in the biggest cities were quite significant, so prices are certainly not going to rebound,"" said Rosealea Yao, a property economist with Gavekal Dragonomics.
""The mild declining trend will continue through at least the first half of 2018,"" Yao said.
More than 45 cities, most of them top-tier cities with a sizable population, have imposed varying levels of restrictions since last October to curb fast-rising prices, with most of the latest measures introduced in late March. 
The cooling effect is most visible in China's the biggest cities. Price growth in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing slowed to 2.7 percent, 8.6 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
From a month earlier, prices in Beijing fell 0.4 percent, marking the first fall since February 2015. Shanghai prices slipped by a further 0.2 percent, while Shenzhen prices remained unchanged.
DECLINING SALES
The value of new personal home mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in the first half of 2017 was equal to 30 percent of the total value of home loans in 2016, a Chinese state newspaper reported.
Still, real estate investment and sales growth both sped up in June after slowing in May, most likely due to more robust demand in smaller centers that have been encouraged to reduce inventory and are not subject to the strict curbs at work in bigger cities.
Luoyang, a third-tier city in central Henan province, topped the list in June, with prices of new units up 2.3 percent on month, compared with a 1.3 percent gain in May, taking the annual growth to 10.2 percent. 
That has also been reflected in stronger credit demand in the month from households.
Keeping a lid on price fluctuations has become a priority for policymakers in a politically important year, with a major leadership reshuffle expected this autumn.
But to make sure the market is neither too hot nor too cold, authorities have increasingly resorted to administrative measures that many analysts warn are anti-market in nature.
For example, sales prices for new units in a few cities like Zhengzhou - capital of Henan - are not allowed to be higher than the price level seen last October for new units in the vicinity. 
FADING AFFORDABILITY 
The upsurge in house prices since 2001 in most major Chinese cities has spurred growing concerns about affordability.
A typical two-bedroom new home in Beijing now costs around 6 million yuan ($870,000), about 69 times the average per capita disposable income in the city, much higher than the ratio of less than 25 times for New York City. 
Economists worry that slowing growth in incomes, which had been rising at double-digit rates for decades, will no longer be able to cushion financial risks in an extremely inflated housing market.

On average, China's disposable income was up 8.1 percent on-year for city-dwellers in the first half of the year, official data showed, slower than the 10.2 percent annual property price growth in June.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation (CPI) rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 2.6% last month. That was compared to forecasts for it to remain steady at 2.9% which had been the highest since June 2013.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation was unchanged in June, compared to forecasts for a 0.2% increase and the 0.3% gain registered in the previous month.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.4% last month, lower than forecasts for it to remain on hold at May’s reading of 2.6%.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 3.5% in June, after rising by 3.7% the previous month. Analysts had expected inflation to ease to 3.6%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.2% in June, compared to a 0.4% advance in the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.3% gain.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 3.8% in June, in line with forecasts and compared to a 3.9% increase the previous month.
Month-on-month, core RPI increased 0.3% last month, compared to May’s 0.4% rise.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 4.7% in June, above forecasts for a gain of 3.2% and following a 5.3% increase a month earlier. May’s data was revised from an initial 5.6% rise.
The ONS indicated that falling prices for motor fuels and certain recreational and cultural goods and services were the main contributors to the fall in the rate.
“These downward contributions were partially offset by rising prices for furniture and furnishings,” the ONS said.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3027 from around 1.3073 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8845 from 0.8813 earlier and GBP/JPY changed hands at 146.31, compared to 146.85 previously.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>","Australia's central bank sees more ""positives"" in domestic, world economy","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank has turned more upbeat on the economic outlook, citing an improving labor market, stronger public investment and a pick up in household consumption.
The mood was clearly brighter, with the word ""positive"" appearing repeatedly in the five-page minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) July meeting and catapulting the local dollar to a more than two-year high of $0.7905.
While traders bid the Aussie higher, economists said the RBA would be in no hurry to raise rates anytime soon as it remained watchful on risks to jobs and housing.
""We would need to see an upgrade to inflation and wages forecasts to change our view of policy on hold until well into next year,"" said Kristina Clifton, economist at Commonwealth Bank.
Besides, analysts suspect the recent sharp rise in the local dollar would itself add to the case against a hike. The RBA has long warned that a rising currency would hurt the economy's transition away from a decade-long mining investment boom. 
Since the RBA's July meeting, the Aussie has rocketed nearly 4 percent to a level that will be highly unwelcome to policy makers in the face of weak inflation at home.
Domestic financial conditions had been further tightened by a recent increase in mortgage rates at Australia's major banks, which followed a clamp-down by regulators on risky lending.
The RBA's policy board also discussed estimates of the neutral level of interest rates - that which neither stimulates the economy nor retards it. This was put at around 3.5 percent, which was down from 5 percent in 2007 but still implied the current rate of 1.5 percent was ""expansionary.""
""The discussion around neutral rates caught the market off guard,"" said Michael Turner, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""They are not necessarily laying the groundwork for a hike but this would be the first step if they were moving in that direction.""
Futures market now implied a 24 percent chance of a rate rise by December, up from just 8 percent previously. It is fully pricing in an increase of 25 basis points by mid-2018.
THE POSITIVES
The RBA welcomed the broad-based recovery in the world economy which had led some other central banks to upgrade their outlooks for growth and interest rates.
At home, the RBA noted a run of stronger employment outcomes augured well for wages, where growth has been stuck at a record low 1.9 percent.
Household consumption growth was showing signs of a pick up with retail sales rebounding for two months. Indeed, data out on Tuesday showed new vehicle sales climbed for a fourth straight month in June to hit record highs.
A new development was an upturn in fiscal spending which was now expected to be stronger in 2017/18 than previously expected, mainly thanks to public infrastructure.
Still, there were a few notes of caution in the minutes.
""...The outlook for growth and inflation meant that developments in the labor and housing markets continued to warrant careful monitoring,"" the RBA said.

""The Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.""

Members commenced their discussion of the Australian economy by noting that year-ended GDP growth in the March quarter had slowed, largely reflecting temporary factors. GDP growth remained below Bank estimates of potential output growth, consistent with spare capacity in the labour market and low inflation. New South Wales and Victoria had continued to make the largest contributions to year-ended growth in domestic demand. Although domestic demand had declined again in Western Australia, there were some signs of improvement in that state. Quarterly growth was expected to have increased in the June quarter despite the disruptions to coal export volumes following Cyclone Debbie.
Growth in household consumption had slowed in the March quarter in line with subdued household income growth. More timely indicators suggested that household spending had strengthened in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had increased in April, consistent with liaison reports that suggested conditions in the retail sector had improved. Members noted that the recent pick-up in growth in employment should also support a pick-up in household income growth, and therefore consumption growth, in the period ahead.
Members discussed the decline in dwelling investment in the March quarter, noting that it had been concentrated in Queensland and in New South Wales, where activity had been affected by wet weather. While the flow of new project approvals had been noticeably lower in prior months, the large pipeline of projects was expected to support building activity at a high level over the subsequent year or so.
Conditions in established housing markets and for new construction had continued to vary significantly across the country and between dwelling types. Sydney and Melbourne remained the strongest markets, consistent with relatively high population growth. Members observed that population growth had been particularly high in Victoria, because of high migration from overseas and interstate. In contrast, Western Australia had experienced a sharp decline in population growth following the end of the mining investment boom. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had softened recently, suggesting that conditions in these markets had eased somewhat. Housing prices in Perth and apartment prices in Brisbane had fallen further. Members noted that there had been several periods in the preceding decade in which housing prices had fallen, or growth had slowed significantly, in different parts of the country.
Private business investment had increased in the March quarter, driven by an unexpected increase in mining investment. Non-mining investment had declined a little in the quarter, but had been gradually trending up for a number of years. Over the previous five years, most of the growth in business investment had occurred in Victoria and New South Wales. Survey measures of current business conditions had generally remained well above average and profits of the private non-financial sector had risen again in the March quarter, to be 30 per cent higher over the prior year. Most of the increase had been accounted for by the mining sector, but other industries had also recorded higher profits.
Public demand had increased modestly in the March quarter. The most recent Australian and state government budgets suggested that fiscal policy would be more expansionary in 2017/18 than had previously been expected. Some of this expansion was expected to come from more spending on public infrastructure, particularly in New South Wales. Reflecting this, work yet to be done on public infrastructure had increased in recent quarters to a relatively high share of GDP. Members noted that infrastructure investment was expected to have significant positive spillovers to other parts of the economy. Non-residential building approvals had also risen in recent months.
The terms of trade had increased again in the March quarter, to be nearly 25 per cent higher over the prior year, but were expected to have declined in the June quarter. A temporary decline in the volume of resource exports in the March quarter had been offset to some extent by ongoing strength in service exports and a pick-up in grain exports as a result of strong winter crop production. The trade balance was recorded as having been in surplus for the second consecutive quarter. Coal export volumes were expected to have fallen in the June quarter as a result of Cyclone Debbie, while iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes were expected to have increased.
Recent data had provided further confirmation that labour market conditions had improved since late 2016, consistent with signals from forward-looking indicators in previous months. Employment growth had been strong in May for the third consecutive month. Members noted that growth in the preceding few months had been driven entirely by full-time employment and that total hours worked had trended higher as a result. The unemployment rate had declined by 0.3 percentage points over the previous two months, to be at its lowest rate since early 2013. However, the underemployment rate, which measures the number of part-time workers wanting to work more hours, had remained elevated.
Over the preceding five years or so, the household services sector had contributed the most to increases in full-time and part-time employment. Full-time employment had also increased significantly in business services over this period, but had fallen in the goods-related sector. Employment growth had remained highest in Victoria over the year and had started to pick up in New South Wales in recent months, following soft conditions over the prior year. Labour market conditions in Western Australia and Queensland appeared to have improved.
Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements and business hiring intentions, had remained positive and generally consistent with the patterns of employment across states and industries.
Wage measures in the March quarter national accounts had continued to suggest that labour cost pressures remained subdued. The Fair Work Commission had announced a 3.3 per cent increase in award wages and the national minimum wage, effective from 1 July 2017. This followed an increase of 2.4 per cent in 2016 and was likely to affect the wages of around two-fifths of workers.
Members noted that wholesale electricity prices had risen sharply over the first half of 2017 and that this had led to significant increases in prices for retail customers. Members discussed these increases in the context of efforts to address climate change and to alter Australia’s energy mix. Concerns about energy security, reliability and costs had been heightened over the preceding six months or so, partly reflecting policy uncertainty and its effect on the investment decisions of electricity generators. Members also discussed how developments in the LNG sector had affected the costs and decisions of electricity generators.
Members observed that the improvement in the world economy was continuing and that output growth in some economies in the March quarter had been a little stronger than expected. Merchandise trade and industrial production had increased further in the preceding months. Higher trade volumes had spurred investment and supported growth, particularly in Japan and other high-income economies in east Asia. Members noted that the ongoing growth in business investment in the major advanced economies and east Asia was a positive sign for the sustainability of global growth in the period ahead. Labour markets in the major advanced economies had continued to strengthen, which was also a positive development for more sustained global growth.
Core inflation had remained low and headline inflation had turned down in a number of economies, as the effect of higher energy prices in 2016 had dissipated. Members noted that non-OPEC countries had increased oil production, placing downward pressure on oil prices and headline inflation.
The pace of growth in the Chinese economy had been maintained in prior months, assisted by the accommodative stance of policy. Growth in investment had been stable, as a solid rise in private investment growth had more than offset a slowing in public investment growth. Consistent with this, Chinese demand for commodities had been resilient. Imports of iron ore had increased since late 2016 and coal imports had stabilised at a relatively high level. Chinese domestic production had increased following a relaxation of policies to restrict output. Members noted that growth in business financing had been stable over 2017 to date, as higher growth in business loans had offset a moderation in the growth of securities financing.
The slowdown in GDP growth in the United States in the March quarter appeared to have been temporary. Consumption growth had picked up in recent months and investment intentions had remained high. The unemployment rate had declined further in May and was below most estimates of full employment. Members noted that wage and unit labour cost growth had increased over the previous two years.
In the euro area, robust growth in retail sales and very high levels of consumer confidence suggested that consumption growth had picked up in the June quarter. Conditions had been supportive of a pick-up in investment and surveys had suggested that firms intend to increase investment accordingly. Increased business confidence had translated into more demand for labour; employment growth had strengthened and had been reasonably broadly based, while the unemployment rate for the euro area had declined to its lowest level since 2009. However, wage growth had remained subdued.
The Japanese labour market had also continued to improve, with strong growth in employment and a large increase in participation by the 65+ age cohort and women. Although total average wage growth had remained subdued in Japan, wage growth for part-time workers had increased.
Members noted that financial markets had generally experienced low volatility over preceding months. The implications of statements by central banks in the major economies for the future path of monetary policy had been a focus for financial market participants more recently.
In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had increased its target for the US federal funds rate by 25 basis points in June, as had been widely expected. The FOMC had also outlined some details regarding the plan for a gradual and predictable reduction in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, which is expected to begin later this year. Members noted that financial market participants continued to expect further increases in the US federal funds rate to occur more slowly than implied by the median projections of FOMC members.
Following its meeting in June, the European Central Bank had removed the easing bias from its forward guidance on interest rates, on the basis of a more positive economic outlook. In response, financial market prices had shifted to suggest that a small increase in the euro area policy rate was expected by the end of 2018. Also, the market-implied probability of near-term policy rate increases in Canada and the United Kingdom had increased in the preceding month in response to statements by senior central bank officials in those economies.
Long-term government bond yields in most of the major financial markets had increased over the preceding month in response to changing expectations about monetary policy. Members noted that yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds had remained close to the Bank of Japan’s target of around 0 per cent under its yield curve control policy. Yields on long-term Australian government bonds had increased a little over June, as had their spread to US Treasury bond yields, although both remained at low levels.
Most foreign exchange rates were little changed over the preceding month. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar had remained around its level immediately prior to the US election, having depreciated over the first half of 2017. The euro had appreciated a little further over the preceding month in trade-weighted terms. The Australian dollar had appreciated somewhat since the previous meeting, consistent with slightly better-than-expected domestic economic news, but had remained in the narrow range of the prior year or so in both US dollar and trade-weighted terms.
Share prices in the advanced economies, including Australia, had been little changed over June. Members observed that Australian share prices had underperformed relative to those in other developed markets over preceding months, largely reflecting a substantial decline in bank share prices. There had been a small partial retracement of this decline in June.
Financial market conditions had remained favourable in most emerging markets, with the decline in government bond yields and the increase in equity prices since early 2017 having continued over the preceding month.
In China, financial market conditions had been tightened during 2017 as the authorities worked towards reducing leverage in the financial system. The renminbi exchange rate had been relatively stable in the first half of the year, following a depreciation over the preceding few years. The stock of foreign currency reserves had also remained steady at around US$3 trillion, after a period of persistent declines.
Members discussed trends in the composition and cost of Australian banks’ funding. Deposits, which are generally a relatively low-cost form of funding, had increased as a share of funding over recent years, to around 60 per cent, while the share of debt funding, particularly at short maturities, had declined. The cost of both types of funding had declined further since late 2016. Members noted that, over the same period, banks’ lending rates had increased slightly, driven by increases in housing lending rates for investors and on interest-only loans. As a result, the implied spread between the estimated average outstanding lending and funding rates for banks was estimated to have increased slightly.
Members observed that housing credit growth overall had been steady during the first part of 2017, with slower growth in lending to investors largely offset by a pick-up in the growth of lending to owner-occupiers.
Financial market pricing continued to suggest that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017, but had shifted to indicate some probability of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018.
Members discussed the neutral real interest rate and its decline over the preceding decade. The neutral real interest rate is the interest rate at which output growth is at potential and inflation is stable. Members noted that it is not possible to measure the neutral real interest rate directly, but that it can be inferred from the behaviour of other variables.
Members discussed the Bank’s work estimating the neutral real interest rate for Australia. The various estimates suggested that the rate had been broadly stable until around 2007, but had since fallen by around 150 basis points to around 1 per cent. This equated to a neutral nominal cash rate of around 3½ per cent, given that medium-term inflation expectations were well anchored around 2½ per cent, although there is significant uncertainty around this estimate. Members noted that some of this decline could be attributed to lower potential output growth, but the increase in risk aversion around the time of the global financial crisis was likely to have been a more important factor, given that the bulk of the decline in the estimated neutral real interest rate had occurred around that time. Estimates of neutral real interest rates for other economies had shown a similar decline. All estimates of the neutral real interest rate for Australia suggested that monetary policy had been clearly expansionary for the preceding five years or so. It was also noted that a reduction in risk aversion and/or an increase in the potential growth rate could see the neutral real interest rate rise again.
Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that the broad-based recovery in the global economy had continued. There had been further signs that investment was increasing and labour markets had tightened further in many advanced economies. This was expected to lead to a pick-up in growth in wages and prices over time. In this context, members noted that a number of central banks had become more positive about domestic economic conditions, and financial market pricing suggested that there had been upward revisions to the expected path of future monetary policy in these economies.
Domestically, the data available for the June quarter had generally been positive, following the slower growth recorded for the March quarter. Although recent indicators suggested that consumption growth had increased in the June quarter, members noted that there were still risks to consumption growth should household income growth remain subdued, particularly given the high levels of household debt. Against this background, the recent improvement in labour market data had been a positive development. Members noted that the strength of recent labour market data had removed some of the downside risk in the Bank’s forecast of wage growth.
Business surveys had continued to suggest that business conditions were above average. Recent state budgets and data on non-residential construction suggested that the contribution to growth from infrastructure investment would rise. The pipeline of residential construction was expected to support dwelling investment over the forecast period. The economic outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Conditions in established housing markets had continued to vary considerably across the country. Members recognised that it was too early for the prudential supervision measures announced by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority, which were designed to help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness, to have had their full effect.
Members regarded the improvement in the world economy over the preceding months as a welcome development. Nevertheless, they assessed that current economic conditions in Australia, and the outlook for growth and inflation, meant that developments in the labour and housing markets continued to warrant careful monitoring. Taking into account all the available information, the Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2017 06:39AM ET</span>",China's strong second-quarter GDP growth paves way for deeper reforms,"By Elias Glenn and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy expanded faster-than-expected in the second quarter, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target and giving policymakers room to tackle big economic challenges ahead of key leadership changes later this year.
The boost to growth was in part driven by firmer exports and production, in particular steel, which could heighten trade tensions as the United States and China begin economic talks this week. U.S. President Donald Trump has made the U.S. trade deficit with China a top agenda item in bilateral talks and has also flagged the steel trade as a point of contention.
China's gross domestic product rose 6.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the same rate as the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. That was higher than analysts' expectations of a 6.8 percent expansion.
Economic data from the second quarter has prompted a number of analysts to upgrade their GDP forecasts for China for 2017, although some moderation in growth is expected later this year as policymakers' efforts to rein in property and debt risks weigh on activity.
""In general, we expect GDP growth to remain robust in the second half but slower than the first half, due to the high base,"" Citi economists said in a research note. ""Looking ahead, uncertainty remains on investment and trade.""
The bank has raised its 2017 annual GDP projection to 6.8 percent on-year from 6.6 percent previously.
The robust numbers kept world shares near a record high and briefly helped China's major stock indexes recoup earlier losses.
The second quarter numbers put the economy on a strong footing to meet China's growth target of around 6.5 percent in 2017, which would give policymakers room to defuse financial risks.
While growth in the high-flying property sector has cooled this year, a rebound in exports after several years of decline has helped prevent any broader slowdown in China's economy.
Retail spending and factory output were also bright spots in the first half. Retail sales growth picked up to 10.8 percent in the second quarter from 10.0 percent in the first quarter, a Reuters calculation based on official data showed. 
Factory output also picked up in the second quarter, though the 6.9 percent growth for the first half was only a slight pickup from recent quarters.
STABILITY AGENDA
The improving economy is no doubt welcome news ahead of an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China, at which President Xi Jinping is widely expected to tighten his grip on power, with leadership keen to ensure a smooth run-up to the meetings.
A consolidation of power could give Xi more clout to push through what analysts say are long overdue but painful reforms such as restructuring massive state firm debt. The president said at the National Financial Work Conference on the weekend he wanted to give China's central bank a bigger role in dealing with risks in the financial system. 
With risks rising in some parts of the economy due to leveraged investments and over-borrowing, officials need to carefully balance support for growth with risk controls.
However, analysts say the central bank is likely to sit tight for now.
""Based on this data, there is no need for easing and no need really for tightening either because inflationary pressures are very much contained. So I think the PBOC (People's Bank of China) just continues to be watchful,"" said Craig James, chief economist for Commonwealth Securities in Sydney.
The stronger growth also means officials will have more room to address the growing debt problem, as China continues to place controlling risk and deleveraging at the forefront of financial policy this year. 
The PBOC shifted to a modest tightening bias at the start of this year, guiding market interest rates higher during the first quarter, including immediately after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates in March.
""Overall, China's Q2 economic performance provides a favorable backdrop for the authorities to push forward with their structural reforms, including those highlighted at the National Financial Work Conference held over the weekend,"" ANZ Bank economists said in a note.
TRUMP TENSIONS
Net exports' contribution to China's GDP growth in the first half of the year was 3.9 percent, a significant improvement from the same period last year, when net exports were a 10.4 percent drag on growth.
With China and the United States set to begin economic talks on Wednesday, simmering trade tensions are sure to be a major topic and firm Chinese export numbers will certainly keep the point of contention elevated. 
Trump has described the trade imbalances between the two countries as a ""very, very big issue"" that he would address. 
The surplus with the United States was $25.4 billion in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, official data showed last week, and its widest since October 2015, according to a Reuters calculation.

Meanwhile, data on Monday, which showed China's steel output hit a record in June, comes amid an investigation by the Trump administration into China's exports of steel and other metals.

330,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone June inflation slowdown confirmed, but core rate rises","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone headline inflation slowed in June but the core figure excluding volatile unprocessed food and energy rose, the European Union's statistics office said on Monday, confirming its earlier flash estimates.
Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.3 percent year-on-year in June, in line with market expectations, decelerating form 1.4 percent in May and 1.9 percent in April.
But its core measure of price growth, which excludes unprocessed food and energy and is closely watched by the European Central Bank, rose to 1.2 percent on the year from 1.0 percent in May.
The figure was above market expectations of a 1.1 percent rise, but matched Eurostat's earlier flash estimate released at the end of June.
On a monthly basis, headline inflation was zero in June, while core inflation was 0.2 percent, Eurostat said.
Headline inflation eased in June mostly because of the marked slowdown of energy prices, which grew by 1.9 percent year-on-year from 4.5 percent in May and 7.6 percent in April. On the month, energy prices were down 0.9 percent.
Inflation also slowed down to 1.4 percent on the year for food, alcohol and tobacco products in June from 1.5 percent in May. On the month, prices for this indicator decreased by 0.2 percent.
But inflation accelerated for services, the largest sector of the euro zone's economy, to 1.6 percent on the year from 1.3 percent in May. Month-on-month, the sector saw a 0.6 percent price rise.

Prices grew at a faster pace also for industrial goods, excluding energy, with inflation slightly picking up to 0.4 percent on the year from 0.3 percent in May, although on a monthly basis prices fell by 0.4 percent.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2017 03:46AM ET</span>",Singapore June year on year exports growth beats expectation on firm electronics,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's non-oil domestic exports grew faster-than-expected in June from a year earlier, thanks to continued growth in electronics shipments as well as a rebound in non-electronic products.
Exports grew 8.2 percent from June last year, data from trade agency International Enterprise Singapore showed on Monday, beating a Reuters poll that predicted a 4.1 percent expansion.
Export figures in May were upwardly revised, growing 0.4 percent on a year-on-year basis compared with the 1.2 percent contraction previously recorded. In April, exports contracted a revised 0.3 percent from the year before.
""It's attributable to a high base last year. If you look at electronics, it's still in positive territory,"" said OCBC Bank analyst Selena Ling. ""We're still on track. Hopefully we won't see a big drop off come second half of the year.""
On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports in June declined 2.7 percent after expanding a revised 9.4 percent in May from the previous month. The poll had projected a monthly decline of 2.1 percent for June. 
In June, exports in the electronics sector -- a major driver of shipments in recent months -- grew 5.4 percent from the year earlier.
Exports of electronics have stayed solid this year, and analysts say they are likely to remain so.
In the second quarter, Singapore narrowly avoided a recession, growing at 0.4 percent from the previous three months, saved by solid global demand for its tech products.
However, some analysts have voiced concern about Singapore's dependence on its electronics industry.
""The issue most critics have with the manufacturing exports uptick is that it is very electronics-centric. If we have a broadening of the growth base, it will be more reassuring,"" said Ling. 
Non-electronics grew 9.3 percent in June after two straight months of contraction, spurred largely by growth of petrochemical exports.
""That is not exactly what you would say would be sustainable,"" Ling said.
A majority of analysts believe that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will keep monetary policy steady when its next policy statement is due in October.

GDP for the second quarter was up 6.9% year-on-year with growth in the second quarter coming in at 1.7%. 
Fixed asset investment was also up, with increases between January to June of 8.6% on year, ahead of expectations. Property investment increased 8.5% in the first half of the year. Retail sales were also positive, increasing 11% in June from a year earlier. Fixed-assed investment in non-rural areas increased 8.6% in the first half of the year.

The figures were based on property advertised between June 11 and July 8, covering the weeks after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her majority in parliament, creating uncertainty for investors who were already on edge about Britain's exit from the European Union.
Rightmove said average asking prices for property sold on its website increased by a monthly 0.1 percent in July, a month that usually sees slight falls in prices.
In annual terms, prices were up 2.8 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise in June.
Other house price measures have shown a slowdown in growth this year, mirroring a weakening of the economy as consumers feel the pinch of rising inflation.
Rightmove director Miles Shipside said the market remained very price sensitive with some properties hitting a price ceiling. He also said that an eventual rise in mortgage costs would be a shock to buyers.
The Bank of England has is considering when to raise interest rates although most of its top officials have suggested now is not the time.
""Price rises are muted despite high housing demand, indicating we have left the stage of the cycle where price rises exceed the rate of inflation,"" Shipside said.
A jump in inflation to nearly 3 percent has hurt the spending power of many people in Britain, contributing to a slowdown in the economy and in house price rises.
Rightmove said asking prices in most of England fell, but the overall average inched up due to gains in London contrasting with a sharp fall in June in the capital.
Rightmove says more than 90 percent of British estate agents use its website to advertise property.
Separately, a survey showed British consumer confidence suffered its biggest fall in more than two years in the second quarter of 2017, mirroring other recent measures of consumer sentiment.

Accountancy firm Deloitte, which published the survey on Monday, linked the fall to the squeeze on living standards.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's economy grew at an annualized 1.4 percent in the first quarter, slightly higher than previously thought due to an improvement in exports, but still its slowest pace in almost two years.
In a second estimate last month, the Central Bureau of Statistics had said gross domestic product <ILGDP=ECI>
grew 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, down from a preliminary 1.4 percent rise -- well below a Reuters forecast of 3.7 percent.
It was the slowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2015. On a per capita basis, GDP in the quarter fell an annualized 0.5 percent.
Fourth-quarter growth was revised to an annualized 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent, the bureau said on Sunday.
Growth in the final three months of 2016 had been boosted by one-off factors including a spike in sales of vehicles that occurred before the tax hike -- which ties the tax payable at purchase to the car's carbon emissions -- at the start of 2017. This also negatively impacted the first three months of 2017.
Analysts said given the distortions, a more accurate figure was GDP excluding net taxes on import -- which eliminates much of the one-time auto effect. It rose an annualized 3.3 percent in the first quarter, revised up from a previous 3.1 percent.
Citing expectations that exports look to improve as global trade strengthens, the Bank of Israel last week raised its economic growth estimate for 2017 to 3.4 percent from a previous 2.8 percent and left its 2018 forecast unchanged at 3.3 percent. Growth was 4 percent in 2016.
In the first quarter, exports - which comprise more than 30 percent of Israeli economic activity - grew 8.7 percent compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the prior estimate. Private spending dipped 1.1 percent versus a 1.7 percent drop, while investment in fixed assets fell by 3.4 percent. Imports shed 9.3 percent and government spending was up 2.6 percent.
The data comes after the bureau said that Israel's annual inflation rate fell 0.2 percent in June from a 0.8 percent rise in May.

Some 42 percent of businesses said Brexit had affected investment decisions and of that, 98 percent said the impact had been negative, according to the CBI survey of 357 companies.
The other 58 percent said last year's vote to leave the European Union had not affected investment plans.
""It is reassuring that the majority of businesses that responded to our survey do not feel that Brexit has changed these vital spending plans,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist.
""But we must have our eyes wide open: an overwhelming number of those that did report an impact said it was negative.""
Businesses reporting a Brexit effect on their investment plans cited general uncertainty over Britain's future relationship with the EU as their top worry. 
The pound's fall against the dollar was seen as the only silver lining to last year's vote to leave the European Union.
Other business surveys have pointed to weakness in investment plans, which are likely to disappoint some Bank of England policymakers who think investment and exports will compensate for a consumer slowdown.
This week a British Chambers of Commerce survey showed investment intentions in the dominant services sector slipping, following a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers that showed much the same.

The figure was less however than the 2 percent government forecast for 2017 in a country where traditionally activity slows in the second half of the year.
The Communist-run island's economy slipped into its first recession in nearly a quarter century last year, as it wrestled with declining oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, a slide in exports and a lack of cash.
In his speech to the Cuban parliament that meets twice a year, Cabrisas said ""this conjunction of accumulated problems cannot be resolved completely in the short term.""
He added the coming half year would not be exempt from tensions, according to the state-run Cuban News Agency.
The Caribbean island is struggling to pay foreign providers on time and seeking longer payment terms, Western diplomats say. The minister acknowledged liquidity problems in his speech.
Meanwhile, Venezuela's crude and fuel deliveries to Cuba slid almost 13 percent in the first half this year, according to documents from state-run oil company PDVSA viewed by Reuters.
The main bright spot in the economy, tourism, performed strongly in the first half of the year with the number of tourists rising 23 percent on the year, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero told the National Assembly on Wednesday.
But U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba as part of a rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente, casting a shadow over the industry's outlook.
Cabrisas said that besides tourism, construction, transport, communications drove economic growth in the first half of the year. Agricultural production was also positive, except for beef and milk, he said.
The minister added that the government had approved 11 new ventures, five in the Mariel special development zone, which Cuba wants to develop into the Caribbean's main shipping hub, and six outside.
Since becoming president in 2008, Raul Castro has sought to update Cuba's Soviet-style command economy, cutting the bloated state payroll, introducing reforms and aiming to drum up foreign investment.

The United Nations estimates the Cuban economy will grow 1 percent this year, in line with a 1.1 percent expansion on average throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 12:52PM ET</span>","Weak U.S. inflation, retail sales data dim rate hike prospects","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June and retail sales fell for a second straight month, pointing to tame inflation and soft domestic demand that diminished prospects of a third interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year.
Still, the economy likely regained speed in the second quarter after a sluggish performance at the start of the year. Other data on Friday showed industrial production picked up in June, driven by a surge in oil and gas drilling.
""Today's reports imply that the Fed will go very slowly normalizing rates, but it also means that businesses will have to really hustle to find ways to keep earnings growing strongly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Labor Department said the unchanged reading in its Consumer Price Index came as the cost of gasoline and mobile phone services declined further. The CPI dropped 0.1 percent in May and the lack of a rebound in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory.
Policymakers are confronted with benign inflation and a tight labor market as they weigh a third rate hike and announcing plans to start reducing the central bank's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. 
In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. The year-on-year CPI has been retreating since February, when it hit 2.7 percent, which was the biggest increase in five years.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in June, rising by the same margin for three straight months. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in May. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure which is currently at 1.4 percent.
Financial markets were pricing in a 47 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in December, down from 55 percent before the data, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
As a result, the dollar fell, briefly touching a 10-month low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose and stocks on Wall Street edged higher. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the recent cool-off in inflation was partly the result of ""a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices"" that would eventually drop out of the calculation.
""We expect a little more cautious language from Fed officials on the inflation outlook going forward,"" said Michael Hanson, chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
BROAD WEAKNESS
In June, gasoline prices fell 2.8 percent, decreasing for a second straight month. Food prices were unchanged after rising for five consecutive months. The cost of cellular phone services fell 0.8 percent, extending their decline amid price competition among service providers.
There were also decreases in airline fares and prices for apparel, household furnishings, new motor vehicles, and used cars and trucks. But rental costs rose, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increasing 0.3 percent after advancing 0.2 percent in May. 
Americans also paid more for hospital visits and prescription medication, as well as motor vehicle insurance.
Low prices are hurting retailers. A second report from the Commerce Department showed retail sales fell 0.2 percent last month, weighed down by declines in receipts at service stations, clothing stores and supermarkets. 
Sales at restaurants and bars, as well as at sporting goods and hobby stores fell. May's retail sales were revised to show a 0.1 percent dip instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent drop. Retail sales rose 2.8 percent year-on-year in June.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Despite two straight months of decreasing retail sales, consumer spending likely gained steam in the second quarter after a helping to restrict economic growth to a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. However, that could negatively impact third-quarter GDP.
""The weak trajectory of consumer spending at the end of second quarter adds some challenges to the third-quarter consumption outlook, which reinforces our view that growth will step down modestly in the current quarter,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
That was supported by a third report showing a measure of consumer sentiment fell to a reading of 93.1 in early July from 95.1 in June. It has declined from a high of 98.5 in January.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered its second-quarter growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.4 percent rate following the inflation and retail sales data.
Still, growth in the second quarter likely got a lift from the industrial sector of the economy. 
In a fourth report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production increased 0.4 percent in June amid robust gains in oil and gas drilling after nudging up 0.1 percent in May.

Industrial production increased at a 4.7 percent rate in the second quarter.

Consumption has sputtered over the past year as the recession, which probably ended in the first quarter, left a record 14 million Brazilians unemployed. Economists expect consumer spending to start recovering in the coming months as interest rates and inflation drop, helping the economy gain speed.

Non-oil domestic exports in June were expected to have risen 4.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in the survey of 10 economists.
On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, non-oil domestic exports in June were seen down 2.1 percent, the poll found.
Exports of electronics have remained solid this year and analysts say, are likely to continue to do so.

The European Union, the world's main trader, also saw its trade increase with all its main partners, with a surge of exchanges with Russia despite economic sanctions on Moscow.
The European Union statistics office Eurostat said on Friday the 19-country currency area in May exported goods worth 189.6 billion euros ($216.3 billion) to the rest of the world, an increase by 12.9 percent on the year.
Imports also grew yearly by 16.4 percent for a total volume of 168.1 billion euros, according to data not adjusted for seasonal factors.
Both figures were the second highest ever-recorded for the euro zone after the peak reached in March when exports were above 200 billion euros and imports stood at 176 billion euros.
The faster growth of imports compared to exports slightly reduced the bloc's trade surplus which stood at 21.4 billion euros in May, lower than the 23.4 billion surplus recorded in May 2016.
Commerce among the 19 euro zone states also increased by 15.3 percent in May on a yearly basis, for a volume of 162.4 billion euros of traded goods.
The European Union as a whole also recorded a 15.9 percent surge of exports to the rest of the world in May year-on-year and a 17.2 percent increase of imports, Eurostat said.
The 28-country bloc expanded its trade with all its main partners in the period between January and May, with exports to the United States rising on the year 6.6 percent and to China 20.3 percent, while imports increased respectively 4.0 and 6.8 percent.
The highest increases were recorded with Russia, which overtook Switzerland as the third main source of imports for the EU.
Despite western economic sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, EU exports to Russia grew 24.6 percent between January and May, driven by manufactured goods and machinery, while imports, composed principally of oil and gas, surged by 37.6 percent.

As a result, EU trade deficit with Russia expanded in May to 29.5 billion euros from 18.9 billions the year earlier.

The June deficit exceeded analysts' estimates of a $35 billion deficit.
Treasury said outlays for military pay, veterans benefits and certain other payments were accelerated into June because July 1 was on a non-business day. Without these changes, the June deficit would have been $51 billion, it said.
Receipts for June grew 3 percent to $339 billion, while outlays, including the accelerated payments, grew 33 percent to $429 billion. Outlay growth would have been 20 percent without the accelerated payments.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called on Congress to raise the U.S. debt limit as soon as possible to ensure that the government can meet its spending obligations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month and producer prices unexpectedly rose in June, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate increase this year.
Thursday's data from the Labor Department underscored labor market buoyancy and suggested that there was enough momentum in the economy to generate some inflation, even though price pressures still remain moderate.
""It remains hard for companies to hire skilled workers. Inflation isn't slip-sliding away from the Fed's goal,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We expect they are on track to announce the start of the balance sheet unwind in September and go for the last of three rate hikes planned for this year in December."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended July 8, the Labor Department said. It was the 123rd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.
That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent. 
The drop in first-time applications for jobless benefits followed data last week showing the economy created 222,000 jobs last month, the second biggest payrolls increase this year. 
A Fed survey of the economy published on Wednesday showed ""labor markets tightened further for both low- and high-skilled positions, particularly in the construction and IT sectors."" 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the 30-year government bond hitting a session high. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
PRODUCER PRICES NUDGE UP
In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent last month amid sustained increases in the cost of services that offset declining energy prices. 
That followed an unchanged reading in May. The year-on-year increase in the PPI, however, slowed to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent in May as last year's energy-driven rise dropped out of the calculation. Economists had forecast the PPI being unchanged last month and rising 1.9 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that
excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.2 percent last month. The so-called core PPI fell 0.1 percent in May.
The core PPI increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through
June after climbing 2.1 percent in May. 
Fed officials are closely watching inflation, which has remained below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for five years. They have largely viewed the recent retreat in price pressures as transitory. 
""We expect inflation pressures to firm in the second half of the year, but any realized gains are likely to be limited,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Fed increased borrowing costs in June for a second time this year. Another rate hike is forecast in December and economists also expect the U.S. central bank to announce in September a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the economy was healthy enough for the central bank to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio.
Last month, prices for services gained 0.2 percent, accounting for almost 80 percent of the increase in the PPI.

Services were lifted by a 0.3 percent rise in the index for final demand trade services, excluding transportation and warehousing. It was the fourth straight monthly increase in services and followed a 0.3 percent gain in May.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 04:37AM ET</span>",China trade with sanctions-struck North Korea up 10.5 percent in first half,"By Fang Cheng and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade with isolated North Korea rose more than 10 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier, a Chinese official said on Thursday, amid pressure from the United States for Beijing to pressurize its troublesome neighbor.
Last week U.S. President Donald Trump denounced China's trade with North Korea, saying it had grown almost 40 percent in the first quarter, and cast doubt on whether Beijing was helping to counter the threat from North Korea.
China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing United Nations sanctions on nuclear-armed North Korea and there is nothing wrong with what it terms ""normal"" trade with Pyongyang, referring to areas not covered by sanctions.
Chinese customs spokesman Huang Songping told a briefing on China's overall trade figures that total trade with North Korea expanded by 10.5 percent to $2.55 billion in the first six months of the year.
While China's imports from North Korea dropped 13.2 percent to $880 million in the period from January to June, exports to North Korea rose 29.1 percent to $1.67 billion, he said.
The exports were largely driven by textile products and other traditional labor-intensive goods not included on the United Nations embargo list, Huang added.
""As neighbors, China and North Korea maintain normal business and trade exchanges,"" he said, adding that goods for ordinary people and those used for humanitarian reasons are not subject to sanctions.
Overall trade growth with North Korea slowed in June, compared with previous second-quarter months. 
Trade in dollar terms with North Korea rose about 12 percent in June from a month earlier to $499 million, according to Reuters calculations based on previously released data. 
The calculations do not reflect revisions to earlier figures that may not have been announced. 
In May, trade with North Korea gained 14.5 percent from April to $443.5 million, previously released customs data show. 
ENFORCING RESOLUTIONS
Numbers showing an increase are not evidence that China is failing to enforce U.N. resolutions, with imports from North Korea falling every month since March, Huang added.
China suspended imports of North Korean coal in February, while imports of iron ore accord with relevant U.N. resolutions, he said.
""China customs have all along fully, accurately, conscientiously and strictly enforced relevant Security Council resolutions.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.N. resolutions did not cover iron and iron ore for civilian purposes, warning against confusion over U.N. sanctions being viewed as comprehensive sanctions on North Korea.
""For China to maintain normal economic relations with North Korea does not violate U.N. resolutions,"" he told a daily news briefing.
Adding to the potential for further U.S.-China trade friction, China had a $25.4-billion trade surplus with the United States in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, customs data showed. The surplus with the United States was China's largest since October 2015.
While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises and not doing enough to get talks back on track, as Beijing has proposed.
Though Trump took a more conciliatory tone on the North Korea issue and China's role at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, Beijing has begun taking a harder rhetorical line with Washington in the past few days.
China's Foreign Ministry this week urged a halt to what it called the ""China responsibility theory"" on North Korea, saying all parties needed to pull their weight.
Trade between China and North Korea has declined in both 2015 and 2016, a senior government-backed academic said in a front-page comment in the overseas edition of the official People's Daily on Wednesday.
""Certain countries have no right to make wanton criticisms of China,"" wrote Su Xiaohui of the Foreign Ministry think-tank, the China Institute of International Studies.

An ""unexpected"" jump in first-quarter trade between China and North Korea masked a declining trend, the state-run Global Times newspaper said last week.

While exports benefited from solid demand for electronics and industrial goods, a growing trade surplus, particularly with the United States, may add to trade tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to boost activity in his country's manufacturing sector.
An increase in trade between China and nuclear-armed North Korea in the first half of the year could also add to diplomatic pressures between Beijing and Washington.
Analysts say economic and political risks could undermine much of the strong trade momentum seen in the first half of this year.
""Looking ahead, we expect export growth to slow on uncertainties in external demand due to rising geopolitical risks and the stronger yuan-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2017,"" Nomura researchers said in a note after the data release.
China posted a trade surplus of $42.77 billion in June, slightly above analyst forecasts for a surplus of $42.44 billion and wider than May's $40.81 billion.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected June shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 8.7 percent, in line with May's growth. Imports were forecast to have climbed 13.1 percent, easing from the unexpectedly strong 14.8 percent jump in May.
The country's demand for imports, particularly for industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal used to feed a construction boom, has remained robust in recent months. This is thanks mostly to resilient real estate demand in smaller Chinese cities with lax property rules as authorities are keen to clear a housing glut.
However, analysts say a slowdown in demand for materials from abroad may already be taking place. 
""Looking ahead, exports should continue to do well given the relatively positive outlook for China's main trading partners,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""But we are skeptical that the current pace of imports can be sustained for much longer given the increasing headwinds to China's economy from policy tightening.""
China's exports denominated in yuan rose 15 percent in January-June from the same period a year earlier, while imports jumped 25.7 percent during the period.
Many economists still expect Beijing's intensifying crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a cooling property market to translate to slower growth after a surprisingly solid first quarter.
China publishes its second quarter economic growth numbers on Monday. Economics polled by Reuters expect gross domestic product growth to have cooled to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent in the first quarter as Beijing tightens the screws on financial risks.
Authorities have continued their campaign to reduce financial leverage in the economy while also maintaining stability in markets.
HEIGHTENED TRADE TENSIONS? 
China's trade surplus with the United States was $25.4 billion in June, up from $22.0 billion in May, official data showed, and its widest since October 2015, according to a Reuters calculation.
While U.S. demand remains robust, concerns of possible trade frictions between the United States and China appear to be back on the radar. Trump has described the trade imbalances between the two countries as a ""very, very big issue"" that he would address. 
Washington is also investigating aluminum imports from China under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration is conducting a separate investigation into steel.
The world's two biggest economies started their 100 days of trade talks in April and agreed in May to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expanding trade in beef and chicken among other steps.

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials will hold a U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington on July 19, which will be the first covering economic and trade issues in a new format for U.S.-China dialogue.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at a record-low 1.25 percent for a 13th straight month on Thursday, a widely expected decision as policy makers seek to boost subdued private consumption and keep any thoughts of tightening off the table for now.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate <KROCRT=ECI> steady, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT)
All 20 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll had forecast the central bank would stand pat, noting that weak private consumption and tepid job growth are taking some of the shine off steady gains in exports.
A majority of analysts see the central bank on hold for the rest of this year, and expect any move to normalize rates to happen next year.
The BOK will release quarterly revisions to its economic forecasts later in the day.
""It would be difficult to raise rates in the second half but raising it in the first half of 2018 would be unavoidable,"" said Oh Chang-sob, fixed-income strategist, Korea Investment and Securities, noting that higher U.S. interest rates raises the risk capital outflows from South Korea.
Markets shrugged off the policy decision, with the won <KRW=> and stocks (KS11) up slightly and futures on three-year treasury bonds rising 0.02 points to trade at 109.17.
After five years of accommodative policy, most analysts expect the BOK to take a hawkish turn next year in a more gradual approach to exiting low rates than some of its counterparts in Europe and Canada.
Indeed, while exports grew at a double-digit rate for the sixth month in a row in June, lukewarm jobs growth and subdued private consumption argue against a rush to tighten rates.
South Korea's consumer price inflation has cooled from the peak of 2.2 percent in March to 1.9 percent in June, slightly below the BOK's target of 2 percent.
It's too early for the BOK to join global counterparts in talking up policy tightening, said Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities.
""The BOK needs to confirm soaring exports leads to stronger domestic demand before it can rise interest rates,"" Kim said before the rate decision.

The Federal Reserve has already raised rates twice this year and is expected to tighten again before year-end, while the European Central Bank is preparing markets for tapering its massive stimulus possibly as early as 2018.

The Washington-based group said its seasonally adjusted index for mortgage applications fell to 391.9 in the week ended July 7, down 7.4 percent from the prior week which marked its biggest decline since a 12.1 percent fall in the Dec. 23 week.
It fell to its lowest level since the week of Feb. 17.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 4.22 percent, its highest since the May 12 week and up from the prior week's 4.20 percent.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC). 
Average rates on other types of mortgages that the MBA tracks were five to nine basis points higher than the preceding week.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications for home purchases, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.5 percent to 242.8 last week.
The group's seasonally adjusted barometer of refinancing applications decreased to 1,210.5, the lowest since the week of Jan. 6. It was 13 percent lower than the previous week for its steepest fall since a 23.2 percent decline in the Dec. 23 week.

The BoC raised the cash rate to 0.75% in a widely anticipated decision. It also raised the bank rate to 1% and the deposit rate to 0.5%.
The rate increase was the first under Governor Stephen Poloz, who took over at the helm of the bank in 2013 after his predecessor Mark Carney went to the Bank of England.
The bank acknowledged recent softness in inflation but said the factors behind it appear to be mostly temporary.
""The adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete,"" the bank said in a statement accompanying the decision.
Expectations for a rate hike had been rising since senior BoC officials said last month that a pair of rate cuts in 2015 had done their job in cushioning the economy from the steep fall in oil prices.
The bank has kept rates unchanged since the two rate cuts in 2015 and the prolonged period of low borrowing costs has been blamed for helping inflate the housing market, particularly in Toronto, Canada's largest city."

LONDON (Reuters) - British workers saw their pay fall further behind inflation in the three months to May even as the unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low.
Official figures on Wednesday will have complicated the debate among Bank of England officials over the need for higher interest rates. 
Sterling bounced higher against the dollar, after data showed that the unemployment rate in the period between March and May fell to its lowest since 1975 at 4.5 percent, below the average forecast of 4.6 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
But lackluster wage growth also showed the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May and her minority government, with growing signs that households are feeling the strain of rising prices since last year's Brexit vote.
The Office for National Statistics said pay including bonuses, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.7 percent in the three months to May compared with a year earlier -- the sharpest drop since mid-2014. Excluding bonuses, it fell 0.5 percent.
In nominal terms, total earnings rose by an annual 1.8 percent, the weakest increase since the three months to November 2014 and compared with 2.1 percent in the period to April. This was in line with the Reuters poll consensus.
Inflation hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent in May, official data showed last month, a bigger increase than economists had expected.
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent signaled his reluctance to raise interest rates in an interview published on Wednesday, and the latest figures broadly confirmed policymakers' existing views of the labor market.
""All of this suggests that a 2017 rate hike from the Bank of England still looks unlikely, particularly in light of the dovish comments from Broadbent this morning,"" said James Smith, an economist at Dutch bank ING.
Broadbent said his caution stemmed in part from uncertainty in businesses about the outlook for Brexit - something that is putting the British government's creditworthiness under strain, ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday.
But some economists said the very low unemployment rate was likely to raise concerns among other BoE policymakers -- some of whom have voted for a rate hike -- that the economy is running at full capacity and that wage growth could soon take off, pushing inflation higher.
INFLATION
The central bank is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation is creating longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019.
The health of the labor market is also a big political issue in Britain.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May pledged more help for ""gig economy"" workers. This part of the workforce has been growing, which partly explains why average wage growth has been so poor despite record employment.
Some private sector surveys point to wage gains for people moving jobs.
""The important thing for us is job churn and we're hopeful that there might be the beginnings of some salary inflation and that will help the job market, which has really been frozen for the better part since 2009,"" Alan Bannatyne, chief financial officer at recruiter Robert Walters (L:RWA), told Reuters.

The number of people in work rose by 175,000 in the three months to May, taking the employment rate to a record high of 74.9 percent, the ONS said.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>","China June new yuan loans rise, but credit growth seen slowing","By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese lenders extended more credit than expected in June, as home lending stayed buoyant while a clampdown on shadow financing activities forced banks to shift more loans onto their books.
Beijing has tightened the screws on financial risks due to an explosive growth in debt but has injected substantial liquidity at times to avoid a crunch and maintain stability.
The stronger-than-expected loans suggest authorities are keeping up support for the real economy, even as they tighten regulations to force banks to deleverage, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
""The shadow banking sector is shrinking but credit for the real economy remains strong,"" he said.
Chinese banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($226.9 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan, up from 1.11 trillion in May.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 738.4 billion yuan in June from 610.6 billion yuan in May, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank's data.
Household loans accounted for 48 percent of total new loans last month, down from 55 percent in May.
Broad M2 money supply, which includes demand deposits and monies held in easily accessible accounts, grew 9.4 percent in June from a year earlier, slowing from 9.6 percent in May, data showed. Economists expected 9.5 percent growth.
The slower M2 growth, the central bank said last month, could be a ""new normal"" after May's reading fell to the slowest since records began in 1996, with analysts saying Beijing is having some success with financial deleveraging.
DELEVERAGING DRIVE
Growth in outstanding yuan loans was flat at 12.9 percent by month-end, although faster than forecasts of 12.7 percent.
Total social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.78 trillion yuan in June from 1.06 trillion yuan in May, the data showed.
The effects of the government's multi-pronged crackdown are showing up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity.
Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, dipped to 428.8 billion yuan in the second quarter from 2.05 trillion yuan in the first quarter, according to Reuters calculations.
Some analysts said the pick-up in new loans may be masking a slowdown in overall credit growth.
""While we think the PBOC is now done pushing up interest rates, we expect the monetary tightening that has already taken place to continue weighing on credit growth from some time,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist, Capital Economics said in a report.
Policy insiders say China's central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in coming months as a deleveraging drive threatens economic growth and job creation ahead of a leadership reshuffle
The PBOC has reiterated that it would continue to implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, and keep liquidity in the country's financial system basically stable in its quarterly monetary policy committee meeting.
China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016 as the government encouraged credit-fueled stimulus to meet its economic growth target.

The credit explosion has stoked worries about financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt, which authorities have pledged to contain this year.

Compared to the previous month, industrial production in the euro area increased by 1.3 percent for a 4.0 percent annual increase. This was ahead of a Reuters poll of 42 economists which had on average expected a 1.1 and 3.6 percent rise.
While industrial production is a trailing indicator, forward looking data are also pointing to a sustained recovery, with euro zone economic sentiment jumping to its highest level in almost 10 years in June.
Growth was strongest for capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, and durable consumer goods, such as cars and household appliances, which rose 2.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively compared to the previous month.
Industrial production rose most sharply in Lithuania and Ireland, with France being the largest riser among the bloc's main economies.

Eurostat slightly revised down its reading for April, to growth of 0.3 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment fell to 4.5% in May, surprising analysts who had expected it to remain unchanged at a four-decade low of 4.6%.
The claimant count increased by a seasonally adjusted 6,000 in June, compared to expectations for a gain of 10,000 people and following a rise of 7,500 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported increase of 7,300.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in the three months to May, in line with forecasts but below the previous month’s gain of 2.1%. The squeeze on real wages continues in the U.K. with inflation having clocked in at 2.9% in May, meaning that Britons are having a harder time making ends meet.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.0% in the three months to May, compared to expectations for a 1.9% gain and April’s reading of 1.8% that was increased from an initial 1.7% advance.

An annual report released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Shanghai found that 73.5 percent of the 426 companies surveyed reported revenue growth in 2016, up from the 61 percent recorded in 2015. 
The U.S. business lobby, which conducted the survey between April 11 and May 7, said this reflected improved economic stability last year.
""These increases reflect a return to previous trends after a particularly poor 2015, not a meaningful improvement in business conditions,"" AmCham said. 
""China remains a difficult market and more efforts are necessary to create a truly level playing field for foreign companies.""
Concerns over the health of the Chinese economy have eased this year after higher government infrastructure spending and a property boom helped it to post better-than-expected growth figures starting from the second-half of 2016.
But Beijing has also pushed forward with policies such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which aims to upgrade the country's domestic manufacturing base, and has undertaken a series of state-driven company mergers aimed at creating national champions. 
These moves were among the U.S. companies' top concerns, AmCham said. More than half of respondents, especially in healthcare, said Chinese policy favored local firms over foreign ones, and 33 percent said policies towards foreign firms had worsened. 
China's new cybersecurity law, which took effect on June 1 and mandates companies store all data within China and pass security reviews, was one example of unfair treatment as it restricted participation by foreign firms in China's cloud market, the business lobby said. 
""There is a growing asymmetry between the access that Chinese companies enjoy in other markets and the access foreign companies have in China,"" it said. 
U.S. companies were also worried about a lack of regulatory transparency, including inadequate protections for intellectual property. Forty percent of respondents believed that the U.S. government should use investment reciprocity to help firms gain better access to China, it said. 
Respondents reported lower long-term optimism levels for a second year, with 80.2 percent of firms expressing optimism over the next five years, down from a few years prior when the metric consistently was above 90 percent. 
Still, most companies were bullish for 2017, with 82 percent forecasting revenue increases, up from 76 percent last year, AmCham said.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale
inventories climbed 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since December 2016 and followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in May. 
Auto inventories jumped 0.7 percent after declining 1.4 percent in April. The auto sector has been hit by slowing demand, with manufacturers reporting a decrease in sales for four straight months.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.3 percent in May.
A report last week showed inventories at factories slipped 0.1 percent in May. Data on retail inventories will be published on Friday. Economists expect inventory investment slowed further in the second quarter and remained a drag on GDP growth during the period.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered it second-quarter GDP forecast by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annualized rate after the wholesale inventory data.
Inventory investment subtracted 1.11 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, helping to hold down the economy to a 1.4 percent growth pace. 
Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. They have remained lean this year, with businesses cautious amid sluggish domestic demand. 
Wholesale stocks of electrical goods fell 0.3 percent in May while professional equipment inventories surged 0.7 percent.
Machinery inventories also increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since November 2014. Petroleum stocks advanced 2.6 percent, the biggest rise since last December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in May from a record high amid a surge in hiring, but an increase in the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs suggested the labor market remained robust.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 301,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday.
The drop pushed the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest reading this year, from a nine-month high of 3.9 percent in April. Hiring jumped to 5.47 million from 5.04 million the prior month. 
There were broad increases in hiring from manufacturing to retail and professional and business services. That narrowed the gap between job openings and hiring, which had raised concerns of a troubling skills mismatch in the economy.
The hiring rate climbed two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.7 percent. Economists shrugged off the dive in job openings, which they attributed to the rise in hiring.
""The job openings plunge in May shows further evidence that the economy is hitting the wall of full employment,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""As the economy ages there's going to be fewer available jobs out there simply because companies have hired all the workers they need for now.""
The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Federal Reserve officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation.
Pointing to labor market strength, 3.2 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in May, lifting the quits rate to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in April. This rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in late 2009.
Despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent, wage growth has remained frustratingly sluggish. 
Average hourly earnings have failed to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.
""We look to quits rate to gauge workers' willingness to
leave current positions in search of higher wages,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Coupled with increased hiring across sectors, the equally broad-based increase in the quit rate should bode well for wage gains."" 

Layoffs were little changed at 1.7 million in May, holding the layoffs rate at 1.1 percent for an eighth straight month.

Analysts had expected the number of job openings to decline from the initial reading to 5.950 million.

(Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. small-business confidence fell in June as business owners expressed frustration over gridlock in Washington, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report released on Tuesday.
The group’s Index of Small Business Optimism <USOPIN=ECI> fell to 103.6 last month from 104.5 in May, although it remains near its highest level in more than a decade. The index surged following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last November, and in January hit its highest level since December 2004.
The rise was largely attributed to business owners' optimism surrounding Trump’s promises of deregulation, tax breaks and infrastructure spending.
But Congress' inability to deliver on those promises has muted confidence as business operators grow wary of political infighting over the healthcare reform legislation, and prospects for tax reform are uncertain.
""As Washington fails to deliver on those two priorities small-business optimism is dropping,"" said Juanita Duggan, president of NFIB. ""Gridlock is driving down small-business optimism, which will eventually drive down the economy.""
With fewer small businesses anticipating improved business conditions, plans to increase employment have also declined, falling 3 percentage points in June to 15 percent of respondents. May's reading of 18 percent matched the highest level since 2006.
In addition, fewer small businesses expressed willingness to hire in June, according to an NFIB jobs report released last week in connection with the government's monthly non-farm payrolls report for June. Forty-four percent of owners said they were hiring or trying to hire in June, down 5 points from the previous month.

""Hiring activity remains strong by historical standards, but the drop in June was unmistakable,"" said Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB’s chief economist. ""Whether this is the start of a negative trend or a one-month blip is something we’ll have to keep an eye on.""

Total vehicle sales hit 2.17 million in June, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier, while sales for the first half of the year rose 3.8 percent to 13.4 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday.
The rise in sales, which industry insiders said was helped by hefty discounting, lends a sheen to the world's largest auto market, but growth overall is struggling to keep pace with 2016 when the market grew at its fastest pace in three years.
Overall vehicle demand in China would likely grow just 1-4 percent this year, mainly because consumers made purchases last year to benefit from lower tax rates, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.
In January, CAAM predicted sales would rise 5 percent this year, slowing from 13.7 percent in 2016, citing the rollback of a tax incentive for small-engine cars and economic pressures. It stuck with that forecast on Tuesday.
June's rise, however, marks an improvement from April and May, when vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, registering two straight months of declines for the first time since 2015.
Peter Fleet, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Asia-Pacific chief, told Reuters average vehicle transaction prices in China had fallen about 4 percent in the first half of this year against 2016. ""We continue to see negative industry pricing in China,"" he said.
Ford is among the foreign brands strong in the small sedan segment that have seen China sales slow this year, others being General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG.
Buyers in China have shied away since the purchase tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or below rose to 7.5 percent, from 5 percent, at the start of the year. 
However, there is one bright spot: sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) - all-electric battery vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids - that saw a 33 percent bump in June to 59,000 units, the latest CAAM data shows.
In the first half of this year, sales volume of such NEVs totaled 195,000 vehicles, up 14.4 percent. 

China is the world's largest market for green energy vehicles, with the government aggressively promoting the segment, including spending billions in subsidies, in a bid to fight intense urban air pollution.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Home lending to property investors in Australia fell for a second straight month in May, early evidence that curbs enforced by regulators to cool the country's red-hot property market was starting to bite.
Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed investor lending shrank 1.4 percent in May, from April, to hit a nine-month trough. 
Importantly, the value of canceled loans climbed about 17 percent to a 10-month high of A$1.44 billion as more people pulled out of deals, a sign tighter lending standards and rising mortgage rates were changing investor behavior.
At the same time, lending to owner occupiers edged up 1 percent, while loans for construction climbed for a fourth straight month and promised to boost supply.
""The home loan data had the right mix in May – more loans to budding home owners and fewer loans to investors,"" said James Craig, chief economist at CommSec. 
""It is also important to remember that lenders may agree to provide finance to buy a home but borrowers may not take up the offer. More budding property owners are getting cold feet and not going through with the deal.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), long worried that debt-fueled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks, will welcome the much-awaited slowdown in lending.
Household debt is already at 190 percent of disposable income and was a major reason the RBA left interest rates at an all-time low of 1.50 percent this month.
Instead, policy makers have tightened rules on home lending and particularly on interest-rate only loans massively favored by property speculators. 
That led the banks to hike rates on interest-only debt in both April and June. Growth in home prices seems to be moderating in response though it remains uncomfortably strong in the two major markets of Sydney and Melbourne. 
Prices in the capital cities rose an annual 9.6 percent in June, down from a peak of 12.9 percent in March. Sydney was growing at 12.2 percent while Melbourne fared better at 13.7 percent. 
Even so, economists said it was premature to call a peak in the housing market, noting that a similar easing off in prices in 2016 proved all too brief.
""Auction activity and price growth show a material slowdown coming through, although both remain fairly mild to date,"" said Westpac economist Matthew Hassan.

""Given the banks made a second round of loan rate increases in June, a full picture is unlikely to emerge until much later in the year.""

May retail sales declined 0.9 percent from April while the consumer price index gained 1.9 percent year-on-year in June, cooling from 2 percent in July and pointing to a slower-than-expected recovery in domestic demand.
The nation's service sector output also declined 0.3 percent in May on-month after a 0.1 percent rise in April.
The ministry said the economy faces uncertainties from North Korean risks, soaring household debt and a lukewarm job market.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",UK shoppers spend more on essentials as inflation rises,"LONDON (Reuters) - British households spent more money on food and other essentials last month but held back on less urgent purchases as they faced rising prices, two sets of industry figures showed on Tuesday.
The data is likely to add to concerns that consumer demand has slowed further after a weak first quarter, as the effect of the fall in the pound after last year's vote to leave the European Union increasingly makes itself felt.
Payments company Barclaycard said year-on-year consumer spending growth slowed to a 15-month low of 2.5 percent in June from 2.8 percent in May, as spending on household goods and entertainment slowed.
The British Retail Consortium said its measure of retail spending growth rose to 2.0 percent last month from 0.2 percent in May, above its average of 1.4 percent in the past six months.
But the BRC's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the pick-up reflected a temporary boost from warmer weather lifting clothing sales, as well as the higher cost of food.
""Rising food prices are responsible for the main component of growth and have prompted more cautious spending towards discretionary non-food items,"" she said.
On a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the BRC said sales increased by 1.4 percent year-on-yaer after a 0.4 percent drop in May.
The Barclaycard and BRC figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is running at a near four-year high of 2.9 percent according to the consumer prices index.
As a result, consumer spending's contribution to second-quarter economic growth - which is adjusted for inflation - may be limited.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that the extent to which consumer spending slows - and whether stronger exports and investment can compensate for this - will be important in determining if the BoE starts to raise rates.
Three policymakers voted last month for a rate rise, and both Carney and his chief economist Andy Haldane have said they could vote for a rate rise later this year.
But weakening business surveys over the past week have made many economists doubt the BoE will press ahead with its first rate rise in a decade at a time when the shape of Britain's Brexit deal is highly uncertain.
Barclaycard said its data showed shoppers were increasingly going to discount supermarkets and looking for bargains online as they ""come to terms with a 'new normal' of subdued wage growth and creeping inflation"".
Spending on necessities had outpaced non-essentials for most of this year, in contrast to previous years.

The BRC said sales of clothing, beauty products and outdoor toys were strong last month - reflecting warm weather and the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. But spending on home furnishings dropped, possibly reflecting a slowing housing market.

Vehicle exports rose 12 percent from a year earlier, while production was up 4.9 percent.
Mexican auto factories exported 276,626 vehicles and produced 334,606 in June, according to data from AMIA.
Auto exports to the United States, Mexico's top trading partner, reached 215,235 vehicles in June, up nearly 16 percent.
Shipments fell 6.7 percent in Latin America and 0.6 percent in Europe, while exports to Asia rose almost 64 percent.
Mexico accounts for about one-fifth of auto production in North America.
Total vehicle exports during the first six months of the year also set a record high, of 1.51 million units, up 14 percent from a year earlier.
The Mexican government is bracing for renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada, as U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted that a new pact must be fairer to his country's workers and companies.

Mexico's booming auto sector has benefited from NAFTA as major manufacturers have made the country a top export hub, attracted by cheap labor and free trade pacts with more than 40 nations.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2017 11:20AM ET</span>","U.S households see spending up, job prospects improving: New York Fed survey","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumers expect to boost spending in the months ahead and voiced confidence they are more likely to find a job and less likely to lose one in a strong labor market, the New York Federal Reserve reported Monday in its latest monthly survey of consumer expectations.
Nearly 35 percent of the 1,300 heads of household included in the June poll said they were better off economically than a year go, a record in the four years the survey has been conducted.
The results bolster the current Fed outlook of an economy that continues to generate jobs despite tepid overall growth and some concern about a recent dip in inflation, improving chances the central bank can follow through with plans for a further interest rate increase later this year.
Though household expectations of inflation for the year ahead did dip slightly from the May survey, to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent, respondents expect strong price increases of 2.8 percent over the coming three years. That's consistent with the Fed's current outlook that the recent weakness in inflation will prove temporary.
The survey also bolstered the view of continued strong consumption growth. Half of those polled said they expected to spend at least 3.3 percent more in the coming year, compared to median expected spending growth of 2.6 percent in the May survey. One-year-ahead expected earnings growth increased to 2.5 percent in the June survey from 2.2 percent in May.
Respondents also showed broad faith in the strength of the labor market, with a slight dip to 13.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the perceived probability of losing a job in the next year, and a jump to 59.2 percent from 56.7 percent in the probability of finding employment.
More than a fifth of respondents said they might leave a job voluntarily in the next year, up from 19.4 percent in May. Voluntarily job exits are considered a sign of a strong labor market that offers employees choices.

The online poll is designed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population. The New York Fed did not provide the margin of error for the poll.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2017 03:04AM ET</span>",Robust German exports push up trade surplus in May,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports rose more strongly than expected in May, outpacing a solid increase in imports and widening the trade surplus of Europe's biggest economy, data showed on Monday.
The surprisingly strong trade figures, released by the Federal Statistics Office, underline how the German economy is firing on all cylinders ahead of a Sept. 24 federal election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term.
The data will also add fuel to the debate about Germany's export strength after the International Monetary Fund on Friday repeated its call for Berlin to increase investment as a way to boost imports, support the economic recovery in other countries and reduce its record trade surplus.
Seasonally adjusted exports climbed 1.4 percent - their fifth consecutive monthly increase - while imports rose 1.2 percent, the data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
Both figures came in stronger than expected: A Reuters poll had pointed to exports edging up 0.3 percent and imports rising by 0.5 percent.
Demand for German goods from countries outside the EU rose the most, with exports to so-called third countries, which includes China, Japan and the United States, soaring 17.3 percent, a breakdown of unadjusted trade figures showed.
""The global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, pointing to especially strong demand for German machinery from markets overseas.
""While private consumption has been an important growth driver in the last few years, net exports are now giving additional stability,"" Gitzel added.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus edged up to 20.3 billion euros from a revised 19.7 billion euros in April. The May reading was in line with the Reuters consensus forecast.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 17.3 billion euros after a revised 14.9 billion euros in April, unadjusted data showed.
""The trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic,"" Gitzel said. ""U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.""
The trade figures come on the heels of solid manufacturing data released on Friday which showed industrial output rose more than expected in May, boosting expectations that factories will support growth in the second quarter.
Analysts expect the German economy to pick up speed in the second quarter after expanding 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year.

The IMF has raised its growth forecast for the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms, compared with its April forecast of 1.6 percent, citing soaring domestic demand and rebounding exports.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2017 11:20PM ET</span>",China's June factory price inflation subdued on modest raw materials recovery,"By Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation was unchanged in June and remained well off highs seen earlier this year, amid lingering oversupply issues in the steel sector and as signs of economic weakness weighed on the outlook for prices.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 5.5 percent in June from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday. This was in line with analyst forecasts and unchanged from the previous month.
Prices of raw materials are making a modest recovery, helped by stronger futures prices in China over the past few weeks, after an earlier hit taken from a broader cooling in economic activity since March.
China's June consumer prices rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, in line with market expectations and May's reading, the NBS said, with food prices continuing their declines albeit at a slower pace.
There are some concerns among analysts that price pressures could weaken throughout the rest of the year as economic fundamentals soften.
""The upshot is that, having eased in previous months, price pressures appear to have stabilized in June,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note.
""Nonetheless, with slowing credit growth likely to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters we think that, volatility in food prices aside, inflation still has further to fall. This will disappoint those hoping for a sustained period of reflation that could help to erode corporate debt burdens.""
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index, fell at a slower 1.2 percent from the previous year, after sliding 1.6 percent in May and 3.5 percent in April.
""Falling food prices can be attributed to a high build-up of food reserves and seasonal factors,"" Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center (SIC), said, according to a story published on Monday in China's Financial News newspaper, affiliated with the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
Tepid inflation comes despite signs of a pickup in factory activity. China's manufacturing sector expanded at the quickest pace in three months in June, buoyed by strong production and new orders.
Meanwhile, spot iron ore and construction steel prices have risen as investors continued to focus on China's capacity cutbacks and industrial upgrade in the steel sector.
""High margins after the government's effort to eliminate low-grade steel are enticing mills to produce more steel, which increases the need for iron ore,"" said Zou Mingdong, Shanghai-based steel manager at Zhongcai Merchants Investment Group.
""However, the rising price doesn't change the fundamental situation of oversupply and weak demand.""
China's biggest steel maker, Baoshan Iron & Steel, cut its main steel products prices for May and June after a long series of increases.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI fell 0.2 percent in June.

China is targeting economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year and inflation of 3 percent. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech at the World Economic Forum that China is capable of achieving its full-year growth target and controlling systemic risks despite challenges.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2017 10:50PM ET</span>","Japan's May machinery orders unexpectedly fall, government downgrades outlook","By Minami Funakoshi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly tumbled in May on persistent weakness in the services sector, and the government downgraded the outlook for orders for the first time in eight months, raising doubts about the strength of the economic recovery.
The result is also particularly surprising given recent signs of an upswing in momentum. It suggests policymakers will have their work cut out in their quest to foster sustainable growth - especially if businesses show reluctance to invest, though some analysts caution against reading too much into the weak numbers.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, dropped 3.6 percent in May from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
It was the steepest month-on-month decline since August 2016, and sharply undershot the 1.7 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. In April, they declined 3.1 percent.
Core orders from the services sector fell 5.1 percent, down for a third straight month, dragged by declines in orders from transportation firms for computer systems and railway cars, and from telecommunications and construction industries.
Orders from manufacturers rose 1.0 percent in May from the previous month, up for a fourth straight month, led by gains in orders for turbines and boilers.
The government cut its assessment of machinery orders for the first time since September 2016, saying they are stalling, in a worrying sign businesses may be turning cautious on investing.
""Machinery orders probably won't be very strong (in the coming months),"" a Cabinet Office official said.
""We can't say they will significantly worsen, but we don't hear companies saying they will start recovering in July-September,"" the official said.
Some analysts echoed the government's pessimism.
""The results were extremely weak...There is a high chance core machinery orders will decline for the second quarter in a row (in April-June),"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, in a note.
Miyamae said it was surprising that orders declined from sectors such as transportation, postal and construction, which have been hit by labor shortages.
PINCH OF SALT
However, some analysts say the Monday's data should be taken with a pinch of salt.
""Machinery orders are volatile...it's better to look at the BOJ tankan in this case,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
The BOJ tankan, a closely-watched central bank survey, showed that big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 8.0 percent in the current fiscal year to March 2018.
Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter, the survey also showed.
Indeed, recent data suggested momentum was picking up, though it wasn't clear if the economic recovery was broadening out, with industrial output falling faster in May than at any time since the devastating earthquake of March 2011.
Japanese policymakers hope capital spending will help revitalize the world's third-largest economy and pull it out of years of deflation and stagnation.
Speaking shortly after the machinery orders results were released, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its massive stimulus program until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target.
He also said inflation is likely to gradually accelerate towards 2 percent reflecting improvements in the economy.

Japan's economy expanded an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and household spending, while business confidence hit a three-year high in the three months to June.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chances of Britain's economy picking up steam diminished further on Monday as surveys showed major companies have curtailed their investment plans and that consumers spent less on their credit cards.
The reports added to a string of lackluster economic data that has raised questions about the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year.
Accountancy firm Deloitte said business optimism at large British companies fell sharply in the second quarter, dampened by the inconclusive outcome of last month's national election.
Deloitte's survey of chief financial officers showed 72 percent thought the overall business environment would be worse once Britain leaves the European Union, the largest proportion since Deloitte started asking the question a year ago. 
Only 8 percent of respondents saw an improvement after Brexit.
""This underscores the importance of the Brexit negotiations producing a favorable environment for UK businesses, with access to the skills and markets they need for their future success,"" said David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe.
The survey's findings have proven a good predictor for the BoE's own investment intentions survey which BoE officials watch closely as part of their monitoring of Britain's economy. 
Businesses are pressing May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit in two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter investment.
Deloitte said investment intentions among CFOs deteriorated, probably disappointing some BoE policymakers who have been pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade.
Rate-setter Michael Saunders said last week he was ""reasonably confident"" that an improvement in exports and investment would more or less offset the consumer slowdown.
A separate survey from credit card firm Visa showed consumer spending fell in June, capping the weakest quarter in nearly four years and adding to other signs that shoppers are reining in their spending due to rising inflation and weak pay growth.
Spending in the April-June period was 0.3 percent lower than in the same three months in 2016. 
""June data provides further evidence that an increase in the cost of living, coupled with slowing wage growth, are beginning to squeeze household disposable income,"" Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said.
Survey compiler IHS Markit this year said the figures may add to calls for the BoE to keep interest rates on hold.

The strength of official data on wages, due on Wednesday, is likely to be critical for BoE policymakers as they mull whether to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labor market strength that could keep the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate hike this year despite sluggish wage gains.
Non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, driven by hefty gains in healthcare, government, restaurants and professional and business services sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday.
That was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists' expectations for a 179,000 rise. The economy also created 47,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.
""The continued vitality in the U.S. labor market means that the Fed is on track to begin shrinking its balance sheet in September and to raise rates again in December,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.
The jobless rate has dropped four-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017. Though the average workweek increased to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in May, wage growth remained stubbornly tepid, putting a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat employment report.
Average hourly earnings increased four cents, or 0.2 percent, in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May. That lifted the year-on-year wage increase to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in May, suggesting some slack still remains in the labor market.
U.S. financial markets shrugged off the anemic wage growth and investors focused on the jump in payrolls, which reinforced views that the economy regained speed in the second quarter after a lackluster performance at the start of the year.
Stocks on Wall Street (SPX) were trading higher and the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies (DXY). Prices for U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) fell.
""The overall takeaway for the growth picture is that the economy seems to have finished the second quarter with decent momentum, and fears of a sharp slowing in the third quarter should be mollified by today's report,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Republican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation.
But Republicans have struggled with healthcare legislation overhaul and there are worries that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda.
WORKER SHORTAGE
There is optimism that the tightening labor market will soon spur faster wage growth amid growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Some economists, including the Fed, believe that weak productivity is constraining wages.
Others argued soft economic growth last year hurt wages.
""Wage inflation was never going to be a 2017 event. You get paid this year based on how your firm did last year and last year was a slow year for GDP and, more importantly, earnings,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""Wages are accelerating in some industries, just not enough industries to push up the averages.""
The Federal Reserve - the U.S. central bank - raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in June for the second time this year.
With inflation, however, retreating further below the Fed's 2 percent target in May, economists expect another rate hike only in December.
They expect an announcement in September on starting to reduce the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.8 percent.
A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.6 percent last month.
This alternative measure of unemployment hit a 9-1/2-year low in May. It has declined eight-tenths of a percentage point this year.
Employment gains were broad in June, with manufacturing payrolls rising 1,000 after factories shed 2,000 jobs in May.
But the automobile sector lost a further 1,300 jobs as slowing sales and bloated inventories forced manufacturers to cut production. The sector has shed jobs for three straight months.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has announced plans to slash 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Others, like General Motors (N:GM), are embarking on extended summer assembly plant shutdowns, which will leave workers temporarily unemployed.
Construction added another 16,000 jobs last month. Healthcare employment surged by 59,100, while the professional and business services sector created 35,000 jobs. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger of future hiring, increased by 13,400. Restaurants and bars hired 29,300 workers.
Retailers recruited 8,100 workers, a respite for a sector which had shed jobs for four straight months. Department store operators like J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), Macy's Inc (N:M) and Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) are struggling with stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon (O:AMZN).

Government employment rebounded by 35,000 jobs last month, with gains at federal and local governments.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 222,000 in June, compared to the rise of 152,000 a month earlier that was revised from the initial increase of 138,000. The data beat the consensus estimate for the creation of 179,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly increased to 4.4%, from the prior 4.3%. Analysts had expected no change.
Average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.2%, compared with expectations for an increase of 0.3% and the prior 0.1% advance that was a downward revision from an initial 0.2% rise.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.5% in June, below forecasts for a 2.6% rise and in line with the prior month’s year-on-year advance.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created more of the new job contracts than expected in June with a total of 187,000, compared to consensus expectations for 172,000. May’s number was revised up to 159,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 147,000.
Government payrolls increased by 35,000 last month, compared to the destruction of 7,000 public jobs created in June, revised from an initial decline of 9,000 positions.
The participation rate ticked up to 62.8% in june from the previous reading of 62.7%.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, rose to 8.6% last month from May’s reading of 8.4%.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours rose to 34.5 in June. from the prior month’s reading of 34.4. Analysts had expected no change.

LONDON (Reuters) - Output by British factories unexpectedly fell in May, suggesting the economy has struggled to gain much momentum after a slow start to 2017 and raising questions about the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year.
The weak data also comes just as businesses are pressing the government to negotiate a smooth exit from the European Union with a leading employers group saying Britain should stay in the single market for a transition period.
Executives from leading British companies are due to meet Brexit minister David Davis on Friday.
Sterling slipped to a nine-day low against the euro and British government bond prices rose after the economic data.
The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output edged down by a monthly 0.2 percent, cancelling out its rise in April and confounding forecasts for a 0.5 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
Construction figures were also much worse than expected. In the three months to May construction output was down 1.2 percent, the sharpest such drop since October 2015.
""It's all building up a pattern here that says the economy is clearly losing momentum,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
""It's not pointing to a particularly dynamic second quarter. Under those circumstances, the timing of the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a rate hike doesn't look great,"" he said.
Britain's economy slowed in early 2017 after initially withstanding the shock of the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016.
Consumers, who are the main drivers of growth, have reined in their spending as inflation rises quickly, pushed up by the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound. 
Still, some Bank of England policymakers are pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade.
Rate-setter Michael Saunders this week said he was ""reasonably confident"" that an improvement in exports and investment would more or less compensate for the consumer slowdown.
The manufacturing figures were hit by a 4.4 percent drop on the month in motor vehicle production, the biggest fall since February last year and tallying with industry figures showing a fall in new car registrations.
Broader industrial output fell 0.1 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April.
Separately on Friday, mortgage lender Halifax said house prices rose at the slowest annual pace in four years, potentially weighing on consumer confidence.
Trade data for May also looked weak.
The goods trade deficit increased to 11.863 billion pounds ($15.33 billion) in May from 10.595 billion pounds in April, the ONS said, wider than all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
Things looked brighter in terms of volumes of goods exported in the three months to May, which rose 3.8 percent. By comparison, import volumes rose 2.8 percent over the same period. However, business surveys have cast doubt about whether an improvement will be seen in the months ahead.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production rose more than expected in May, data showed on Friday, boosting expectations that factories will support growth in Europe's biggest economy in the second quarter.
The surprisingly bullish figures are the latest in a batch of strong data that are likely to help Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservatives burnish their economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election in which she will seek a fourth term.
Industrial output jumped by 1.2 percent on the month in May, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and easily beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 0.3 percent gain.
The upturn was driven by a surge in energy production and factories producing more capital and consumer goods.
""The trend in the industrial sector is clearly pointing upwards,"" the ministry said, adding that the upswing in manufacturing had broadened since the beginning of the year.
The bright picture was also mirrored in the less volatile three-month comparison: Industrial output rose by 2.1 percent from March to May, with construction jumping by 6.1 percent.
""The sector is now set to grow by 2 percent in the second quarter - we haven't seen anything like this since 2010,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said.
The output data comes on the heels of bullish sentiment indicators such as the Ifo index, which showed business morale hit a record high in June.
A survey among purchasing managers released this week suggested German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged.
Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the data supported expectations that the German economy accelerated sharply in the second quarter after expanding by 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year.
""This may lead to stronger calls for policy tightening by the ECB from some quarters, but the Bank will remain wary of the lack of inflationary pressure elsewhere in the euro zone and the potential impact of any hawkish signals on financial markets,"" she said.

Data published on Thursday had shown strong foreign demand raised industrial orders in May, though the increase was less pronounced than expected.

Core machinery orders are seen rising 1.7 percent in May from the previous month following a 3.1 percent drop in April, the Reuters poll of 17 economists found.
The highly volatile data series is regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months.
Analysts say a pickup in the global economy and a weaker yen should underpin core machinery orders, as companies enjoying strong earnings continue to spend on equipment.
Those signs were evident in some recent solid data, helping bolster the world's third-biggest economy. The latest Bank of Japan's survey showed confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter. 
In the longer term, however, business spending might remain uneven due to uncertainty over U.S. trade policies. Concerns persist about President Donald Trump's pledge to adopt protectionist trade policies, which could hurt Japan's export-driven economy. 
""There is an increasing demand for capital spending for labor-saving equipments due to labor shortage,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""But some companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, retain their cautious stance on investment.""
Compared with a year ago, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, jumped 7.7 percent in May after a 2.7 percent gain in April.
The Cabinet Office will release the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT).
Data on the current account balance, which will be released at the same time as machinery orders, is expected to show a surplus of 1.796 trillion yen ($15.81 billion) in May, from 1.95 trillion yen in April.
The surplus is mainly seen from gains in the income balance, lifted by earnings from Japanese subsidiaries overseas thanks to a weaker yen and a strong global economy.
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, was tipped to show an annual 2.1 percent rise in June. The data will be released on Wednesday.

The percentage of households that expect prices to increase five years from now also rose to the highest in a year, the survey for June showed, supporting the Bank of Japan's optimism that its quantitative easing is gaining traction.
The survey follows government data showing a pickup in wages and other signs that consumer spending is starting to improve after a period of prolonged weakness, developments that are essential to meeting the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.
In June, 75.4 percent of households surveyed said the expected prices to rise a year from now, which was up for the second consecutive quarter to reach the highest since March last year, the BOJ's quarterly survey on people's livelihoods showed on Friday.
The percentage of households that expect prices to rise five years from now rose for the second straight quarter to 82.3 percent, the highest level in a year, the survey showed.

Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of total pay and determines base salaries, jumped 0.9 percent in May from a year earlier - the biggest rise since March 2000, labor ministry data showed on Friday.
Inflation-adjusted real wages rose an annual 0.1 percent in May, following a flat reading in April.
The rise in real wages, though small, suggests that Japan's tight labor market is starting to translate into higher pay, and adds to other signs its economic recovery is gaining momentum. This is encouraging news for the Bank of Japan, which hopes higher pay will help boost private consumption and spur inflation toward its 2 percent goal.
""I think wages and inflation are going to rise gradually, given the labor shortage,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The fact that wages are rising offers some support to the BOJ,"" Tonouchi said. Companies will eventually have to raise prices to cover the rising labor costs, he added.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose an annual 0.7 percent in May, the biggest rise in 10 months, the data showed. It followed a 0.5 percent increase in April.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, grew 0.7 percent in May from a year earlier, the biggest rise in 13 months.
Special payments, such as bonuses, dropped 1.6 percent in May on year. Special payments are generally small, so even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes.
Japan's economy expanded an annualised 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports, and business confidence hit a three-year high in the three months to June.
At a rate review on July 19-20, the BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than it did in June to say it is expanding moderately, sources have told Reuters.

However, the central bank will cut its inflation forecasts and its nine-member board will seek to explain why the strength in the economy has yet to translate into firmer prices, sources have also said.

The signs of pay pressure in the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey contrast with Britain's official measure of growth in earnings which has weakened recently.
Growth in starting salaries for permanent jobs hit a 19-month high in June in June, REC said, offering Bank of England policymakers a rare suggestion that wage growth in Britain will accelerate, as they expect. 
""With fewer people currently looking for jobs, employers are having to increase starting salaries to secure the talent they need,"" Tom Hadley, REC Director of Policy, said.
""Existing skills shortages are being exacerbated by Brexit. For example, demand for accountants and other financial roles has increased recently as organizations try to protect themselves against economic uncertainty.""
Other indicators of pay have been weak. Official data showed wages grew at the slowest pace since February last year in the three months to April, rising 2.1 percent on the year and falling further behind inflation which is close to 3 percent.

Other business surveys have also pointed to weak upward pressure on wages.

Britain's economy has slowed as the rise in inflation since last year's Brexit vote and modest pay growth have hurt consumer spending. Recent surveys have shown a sharp drop in consumer confidence.
However, accountancy firm BDO said its monthly High Street Sales Tracker found overall like-for-like sales rose 1.3 percent in June.
""This growth was off a negative base of -3.6 percent for the same month last year, but after four months with no growth, this might offer a ray of sunshine to UK retailers,"" BDO said.
It said fashion sales increased 1.4 percent, while homeware sales were up 0.5 percent.
""Retailers will take heart from consumers’ willingness to spend, but there is evidence shoppers are delving into their savings which is clearly not a sustainable position,"" said Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO.
Some Bank of England officials believe the consumer slowdown will be offset by higher exports and investment. However, two of the eight sitting monetary policy makers voted last month for a rate hike. A third supporter of a hike has since left the BoE.
Reports from retailers themselves have been mixed. On Thursday, Associated British Foods' (L:ABF) budget fashion arm Primark reported a strong quarter of trading and last week electricals retailer Dixons Carphone (L:DC) said the consumer environment was holding up.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, late on Thursday raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row, confounding economists who had forecast it would hold them.
At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the bank raised the overnight deposit rate to 18.75 percent from 16.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 19.75 from 17.75 percent, it said in a statement, after hiking them by 200 points each at the last policy-setting meeting in May.
Egypt floated its currency in November, and since then its pound has roughly halved in value. As the currency's value dropped, inflation surged. Although the core rate slipped in May, it remains almost 30 percent year-on-year.
The central bank raised interest by 300 basis points after the currency floatation, which helped Egypt clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program tied to ambitious reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts.
The IMF has said lowering inflation is key to keeping its economic reform program on track and that raising key interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so.
Ongoing reforms tied to the IMF loan program had increased risks for inflation, which the bank aims to reduce to 13 percent by end-2018, the bank said.
""Higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017, as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressure,"" it said.
Nine out of 10 economists polled by Reuters on Monday predicted the bank would leave its key interest rates unchanged.
Hany Farahat, senior economist at CI Capital, was the sole dissenter. He told Reuters on Thursday following the hike announcement that he did not expect it to be effective in combating inflation.
""We expected a rate hike despite our view that it will not reduce inflation. The central bank had no choice as it followed a very steep fuel price hike, which the finance ministry said would add 4 percent to inflation,"" he said.
""Impact from the hike will be diluted as bank are now reluctant to pass on the rate increases on to their deposit and savings rates as a way of limiting costs. Accordingly, this step will not absorb additional liquidity from the system.""
Egypt's economic growth has deteriorated since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away, draining foreign reserves and putting pressure on President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who has to maintain support amid tough economic reforms that have sent inflation shooting up.
The government last week hiked fuel prices by up to 50 percent for the second time since November in another step to narrow its budget deficit. The hike would add 3 to 4.5 percentage points to inflation, Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak told Reuters on Monday.

Electricity Minister Mohamed Shaker said on Thursday Egypt will hike electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households as of Aug. 1 but keep energy subsidies in place three years longer than expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired fewer workers than expected in June and applications for unemployment benefits last week increased for a third straight week, pointing to some loss of momentum in job growth as the labor market nears full employment.
Those signs were also evident in another report on Thursday showing growth in services industry employment slowing in June even as the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, continued to expand at a healthy clip. 
The moderation in job gains likely reflects difficulties by employers finding suitable workers amid an unemployment rate that is at a 16-year low. Even so, the labor market remains strong and tightening conditions could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year. 
""The slowdown in hiring, in our view, is a function of the difficulty in hiring workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""Companies remain very reluctant to lay off workers and this is a continued sign of the tightness of the labor market.""  
The ADP National Employment Report showed private sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, stepping down from the 230,000 positions created in May and below economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000.
The report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. 
While the ADP report has a spotty record predicting non-farm payrolls, June's modest job gains together with the modest rise in first-time applications for jobless benefits and cooling services sector employment pose a downside risk to the government's June jobs report.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, non-farm payrolls likely increased by 179,000 last month after May's 138,000 gain. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.3 percent. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the data as did prices for U.S. Treasuries. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1. It was the third straight weekly increase in claims.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The rise in claims last week likely reflected automakers' closing of assembly plants for the annual summer retooling. Still, it was the 122nd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. 
That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low.
Unadjusted claims for Michigan, a hub for auto production, increased 1,159 last week. Automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling at the start of July, which tends to push up claims.
Applications are likely to remain elevated as some companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) embark on extended summer shutdowns to deal will slower sales, which have led to an inventory bloat.
Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month. Even before the annual summer plant closures, automakers have been laying off workers in response to the softening demand.
""As the recovery has progressed and pent-up demand for autos has likely been filled, the high levels of existing inventories and softening demand are likely to lead some automakers to shut down for longer than the normal one to two weeks,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
A third report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its non-manufacturing sector index rose half a point to a reading of 57.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector. Industries reported an increase in new orders, but said employment growth had slowed. 
The construction industry described the labor market as continuing to be ""constrained,"" and said low unemployment in most regions was ""making hiring difficult on all phases of the construction supply chain."" 
The services sector strength was also echoed by another survey on Thursday. The IHS Markit's services sector activity index rose to a reading of 54.2 last month from 53.6 in May, marking a third month of accelerated growth in activity.
A report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit fell 2.3 percent to $46.5 billion in May.
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit narrowed to $62.8 billion from $63.8 billion in April. Real goods exports surged to an all-time high in May, propelled by record high petroleum exports.
Still, the real trade deficit averaged $63.3 billion in April and May, above the first quarter's average of $62.2 billion. That suggests trade will be a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter after contributing 0.23 percentage point to the economy's 1.4 percent annualized growth pace in the first three months of the year.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered its second-quarter GDP forecast to a 2.7 percent rate from 3.0 percent earlier.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. sales of new vehicles should hit a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.1 million units in 2017, the National Automobile Dealers Association said on Thursday, especially if automakers bring high inventory levels under control.
In a media conference call, Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the dealer lobbying organization, said sales should dip to 16.8 million units in 2018 and then be within a range of 16.5 million units to 16.8 million units through 2020.
After a record 17.55 million units sold in 2016, the U.S. auto industry has posted declining sales for the last four months, with high consumer discounts and inventory levels posing concerns for Wall Street.
A glut of nearly new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles is expected to pose a challenge to new vehicle sales.
Sales of sedans have been particularly weak as consumers have increasingly shifted toward pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Szakaly said consumer discounts are focused heavily on the less-popular models.
""We do expect incentives to rise this year, especially as off-lease (sales) begin to exert further downward pressure on sedan pricing throughout the rest of 2017,"" he said.
Tackling high inventory levels should help automakers meet the NADA's sales forecast, Szakaly added.

""If we see inventories level off into September and throughout the third quarter, I think it will be a very strong sign that the industry has made the right decisions... and we should easily make our 17.1 million sales number,"" Szakaly said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The majority of Mexico's central bank board believes it is crucial to maintain the nation's relative monetary policy stance with the United States now that the Federal Reserve has begun raising rates, according to minutes of the bank's June 22 meeting released on Thursday.
""Most members said that given the recent interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, it is indispensable right now to maintain the current relative position,"" the statement said. 
Nonetheless, most members also said there could be a pause in the bank's rate hike cycle, considering that consumer price movements appear to be helping inflation reach the bank's 3 percent target.
Mexico's central bank board raised interest rates  a quarter percentage-point to 7.00 percent at last month's meeting, with one member voting to hold them steady.
The central bank has increased its main interest rate in the last seven meetings. Monetary policy is at its tightest since early 2009, and inflation is at a more than an eight-year high.
Policymakers said in their statement last month that with the latest hike, rates ""have reached a level that is consistent with the process of efficient convergence of inflation to the 3 percent target,"" but they said they would be vigilant.
A majority of members said the June rate move would help bring inflation down toward the bank's target. 
The board raised the rate both to anchor inflation expectations and because of the Fed hike, a majority of members said.

The Fed voted in June to raise rates for the second time this year.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are open to a further step toward reducing their monetary stimulus but are likely to move slowly out of fear of causing market turmoil, minutes of their last meeting showed on Thursday.
With inflation in the euro zone slowly rebounding, the ECB is preparing to dial back its stimulus policy of ultra-low rates and massive bond purchases, but doing so without upsetting investors is proving a challenge after years of easy money.
Rate setters meeting on June 7-8 discussed dropping a long-standing pledge to boost the ECB's 2.3 trillion euros bond purchase program if necessary, a key element of their policy message. 
Eventually they decided against doing so because the euro zone's economic recovery had yet to result in higher inflation - the bank's main policy objective.
But, confirming a Reuters exclusive, the central bankers said they could review that so-called easing bias at future meetings.
""If confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case for retaining this bias could be reviewed,"" the ECB said in its policy accounts.
German government bond yields hit new 18-month highs and the euro edged higher after the minutes were released as traders speculated on a ""tapering"" of the ECB's debt-purchase program, due to run until December.
They were resuming a rally started last week, when ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at possible policy tweaks.
""The ECB’s tiptoeing towards tapering will continue,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""It should remain a very gradual and cautious process, given the ECB’s fear of taper tantrum.""
""CONTINUED CAUTION""
In the minutes, the ECB stressed the need for ""continued caution in communication"" as any perception that it was moving away from its stimulus policy could roil financial markets, undoing some of its previous efforts.
Indeed, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said earlier on Thursday the central bank needed to be patient and maintain a steady hand in policy as inflation was still far below its target of almost 2 percent.
Despite a brisk economic rebound, inflation in the euro zone was 1.3 percent in June and is not expected to near 2 percent at least until 2019.
ECB rate setters meeting in June said they found it ""puzzling"" that forecasts for core inflation had to be revised downwards despite stronger economic growth and a falling unemployment rate.
Still, Draghi argued last week that accelerating growth would in itself provide support so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged.
That message stirred markets, stoking speculation that policymakers could decide as early as September to reduce asset purchases from next year.

The ECB's asset buys are set to run until the end of the year and policymakers will decide in September or October whether to extend, reduce or gradually wind down the purchases.

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) increased to 57.4 in June from the prior month’s reading of 56.9.
Analysts had expected the index to decline to 56.5 last month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index increased to 60.8 last month, 0.1 points above May’s reading of 60.7. That was in line with the consensus forecast
The New Orders Index registered 60.5 in June, 2.8 points higher than the reading of 57.7 in the previous month.
The Employment Index decreased 2.0 points to 55.8 last month from May’s reading of 57.8.
The Prices Index increased 2.9 points to 52.1 in June from the prior month’s reading of 49.2.
The ISM indicated that it was the 90th consecutive month of expansion of economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector.
“The non-manufacturing sector continued to reflect strength for the month of June”, ISM chair Anthony Nieves declared in the report.
“The majority of respondents’ comments are positive about business conditions and the overall economy,"" he added.
Following the report, EUR/USD was unchanged at 1.1395, GBP/USD was at 1.2930 from 1. 2927 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 113.10 from 113.05 prior to the publication.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 95.71 compared to 95.70 prior to the release.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets were trading lower after the open. The Dow 30 fell 127 points, or 0.59%, the S&P 500 lost 18 points, or 0.76%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 64 points, or 1.04%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,223.96 a troy ounce, compared to $1,225.08 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $45.95 a barrel from $45.87 earlier."

second quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap decreased 2.3 percent to $46.5 billion. April's trade deficit was unrevised at $47.6 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap falling to $46.2 billion in May. 
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit narrowed to $62.8 billion from $63.8 billion in April. Real goods exports surged to an all-time high in May, propelled by record high petroleum exports.
Still, the real trade deficit averaged $63.3 billion in April and May, above the first quarter's average of $62.2 billion. That suggests trade will be a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter after contributing 0.23 percentage point to the economy's 1.4 percent annualized growth pace in the
first three months of the year. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.0 percent rate in the second quarter.
In May, exports of goods and services rose 0.4 percent to $192.0 billion, the highest level since April 2015, lifted by a surge in exports of consumer goods such as cell phones and other household goods. 
There were also increases in exports of motor vehicles and parts. Food exports, however, fell by $0.7 billion amid a $0.6 billion drop in soybean shipments. Exports to China increased 3.6 percent. The value of goods shipped to Mexico and Canada rose 5.4 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively. 
Exports to Germany gained 7.4 percent. 
Imports of goods and services dipped 0.1 percent to $238.5 billion in May. Cell phone and other household goods imports fell $0.9 billion, accounting for the bulk of the $1.5 billion decrease in consumer goods imports. 
There were also declines in imports of motor vehicles and parts. However, imports of capital goods increase $1.3 billion. The country imported 265 million barrels of oil in May, the most since August 2012. Imports of goods from China increased 11.6 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased 14.4 percent to $31.6 billion in May. 

The trade gap with Mexico surged 15.8 percent to $7.3 billion, the highest since October 2007.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 185,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 140,000 to 233,000.
Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 230,000 from an originally reported 253,000 increase.
The U.S. private sector added 62,000 workers in October 2016.
The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 172,000 jobs in June, up from 147,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have increased by 179,000.
The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at the 4.3 percent recorded a month earlier.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 08:43AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims rise for third straight week,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose for a third straight week last week, likely as some automakers closed assembly plants for the annual summer retooling.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 243,000 in the latest week. 
It was the 122nd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.
That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 750 to 243,000 last week.
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data. Claims for six states and a territory, including California and Alabama, were estimated because of Tuesday's Independence Day holiday. That probably did not contribute to last week's increase as some of the estimates
showed a decrease in applications.
Unadjusted claims for Michigan increased 1,159 last week. 
Automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling at the start of July, which tends to push up claims.
Applications are likely to remain elevated as some companies like General Motors (N:GM) embark on extended summer shutdowns to deal will slower sales, which have led to an inventory bloat.
Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month. Even before the annual summer plant closures, automakers have been laying off workers in response to the softening demand.
Outside the auto sector, the labor remain strong, with
record high job openings. Labor market tightness contributed to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates last month for the second time this year. 
Economists expect another rate hike and the U.S. central bank to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities later this year.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 11,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended June 24. The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 12 straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.
The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 6,750 to 1.94 million, remaining below the 2 million mark for 10 consecutive weeks.

(Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. firms fell in June to its lowest level of the year as employers opted to hold onto existing jobs in a tight labor market where skilled laborers are harder to find, a report released on Thursday showed.
U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported. 
Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016.
""Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor,"" John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters.
With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said.
The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016.
The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016. 
One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc (N:M) close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales. 
The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger.

Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again.

431,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 07:38AM ET</span>",ECB minutes say officials discussed removing easing bias,"Investing.com - Officials at the European Central Bank discussed removing the easing bias, but decided that its was prudent that it remained, the minutes of its June meeting showed on Thursday.
The ECB Governing Council judged that it was important to stress the stronger momentum of the euro area recovery, while emphasizing that inflation remained subdued.
Officials were concerned that even ""small and incremental"" changes to forward guidance would spook markets.
“It was necessary to avoid signals that could trigger a premature tightening of financial conditions,” the minutes said.
The minutes come after ECB President Mario Draghi appeared to open the door to policy adjustments in comments last week, fueling speculation the bank could start to scale back its stimulus program as soon as September.
Draghi said factors weighing on inflation in the euro area were mainly temporary, adding that the bank could look through them.
He also said the ECB sees growth that is above trend and well distributed across the euro area, but reiterated that “a considerable degree” of stimulus is still needed in the euro zone, and that the ECB must be “prudent” in how it unwinds it.
ECB sources subsequently said the markets had over interpreted Draghi’s remarks.
Earlier Thursday, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said the bank needs to be patient and maintain a steady hand in policy as inflation is still far below its target."

Middle East carriers had a 3.7 percent rise in demand in May compared to a year ago, close to an eight-year low, with IATA saying that reflected the ban on large portable electronics devices in the cabin from 10 airports in the region to the United States, plus uncertainty over President Trump's proposed travel bans.
Qatar Airways on Thursday joined Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) and Etihad in saying the ban had been lifted.
Overall, IATA said global capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 6.1 percent, slower than demand. That meant load factors - a measure of how full planes are - increased 1.2 percentage points to 80.1 percent, which IATA said was a record for the month.
""The rising price of fuel and other input costs is likely to see airlines' ability to stimulate markets with lower fares taper over the coming months,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said.

(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms hit its highest level in nearly a year, data showed on Thursday, suggesting businesses are ramping up investments to meet customer demand.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index for May rose to 137, its highest since June 2016, from an upwardly revised April reading of 125.4. 
The increase was driven by an 11 percent year-on-year rise in borrowing by businesses in arts and entertainment. Transportation and healthcare companies slashed borrowing, however, by 14 percent and 13 percent respectively.
The rise in the index ""is not enough to say 'we're off to the races,'"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder. But at least ""we're not going into contraction mode,"" he added. 
Movements in the index typically correspond with changes in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter, and the Atlanta Fed projects second-quarter expansion at 3 percent.
A separate barometer of small companies' financial health suggested companies are finding it easier to pay off old loans. The share of loans more than 30 days past due was 1.69 percent in May, down from a month earlier, PayNet data showed. 
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because those companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains. 

PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 03:29AM ET</span>",German industrial sector getting back on track as orders pick up,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Foreign demand helped German industrial orders rebound in May, albeit less than forecast, data showed on Thursday, and the Economy Ministry said it expected this sector of Europe's largest economy to continue gathering some momentum.
Factories registered a 1.0 percent increase in orders in May after contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods dropped by a downwardly revised 2.2 percent in April, data from the Economy Ministry showed. 
The reading for May undershot the Reuters forecast for a 2.0 percent rise, with the Economy Ministry saying the proportion of bulk orders was below average for May.
""The German industrial sector is back in form and the decline in April was likely a one-off,"" said Dirk Schlotboeller, an economist at Germany's Chambers of Commerce (DIHK).
""Although increasing protectionism around the world is dampening the mood, business is going extremely well in Europe, Asia and also in the USA,"" he said, adding that investment was finally picking up.
But others were less optimistic, with Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG, saying the data was disappointing in view of bullish sentiment indicators such as Ifo, which showed business morale hitting a record high in June.
Bookings for capital goods picked up but factories making consumer and intermediate goods saw a downturn in demand. 
A breakdown of the May data showed domestic demand tumbled by 1.9 percent while foreign orders climbed by 3.1 percent, with orders from outside the euro zone surging by 4.0 percent.
On the less volatile two-month comparison, orders declined by 1.1 percent but the Economy Ministry said the average order level for the April-May period was roughly at the same level as the strong first quarter.
The data comes on the heels of a survey showing German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged and manufacturers were increasingly optimistic about the outlook for production.
Other recent indicators also bode well for the sector, with data from the VDMA industry association showing engineering contracts jumping 17 percent in May from the previous year.
Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand.

But the government remains more cautious, forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018. This would be below the 1.9 percent in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 02:57AM ET</span>",Australia's trade surplus balloons in boost to economy,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus rebounded sharply in May as coal shipments recovered faster than expected from cyclone-induced disruptions, putting exports back on track to add to economic growth in the quarter.
Combined with recent upbeat reports on consumer and business spending, economic growth now looks likely to have picked up from the March quarter's disappointing 0.3 percent pace.
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the trade surplus surged to A$2.47 billion ($1.88 billion) in May, up from a downwardly revised A$90 million in April and more than twice market forecasts of A$1.1 billion.
Exports of coal alone jumped 62 percent to a cool A$5 billion as mines rushed to resume shipments after Cyclone Debbie tore up rail tracks in Queensland, one of the world's biggest coal-exporting regions.
Total exports climbed 8.5 percent to more than recover April's slump, while imports edged up just 0.7 percent.
Crucially for growth, export volumes were strong across the board with hard coking coal up 180 percent, semi-soft coal 58 percent and iron ore fines 5 percent.
That suggests net exports made a welcome contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in the June quarter, having been the biggest single drag on growth early in the year.
GAS-POWERED SURPLUS
Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also ramping up significantly as new projects come on line, with export volumes up a huge 29 percent in May.
Analysts at National Australia Bank predict the value of LNG exports will pass A$27 billion this year and near A$35 billion in 2018, overtaking coal as the second biggest earner.
Australia has been on track to overtake Qatar as the world's largest LNG exporter, but just this week the Gulf state announced plans to expand its output by 30 percent. 
The West's three biggest energy corporations have expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years.
Australian output is forecast to reach 85 million tonnes in the next one to two years.
Qatar's plans may not be a threat to Australia in the near term given the vast bulk of its LNG has already been sold on long-term contracts.
Still, greater competition from such a low-cost producer as Qatar could eventually threaten markets in Asia, where Australia is currently the largest supplier to Japan and China and the second largest to Korea.
Much hangs on the fortunes of the industry, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) counting on LNG exports to add half a percentage point to economic growth in both 2017 and 2018.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2017 04:19PM ET</span>",Fed minutes suggest increasing tensions on inflation shortfall,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, according to the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting on June 13-14 released on Wednesday.
The details of the meeting, at which the U.S. central bank voted to raise interest rates, also showed that several officials wanted to announce a start to the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities by the end of August but others wanted to wait until later in the year.
""Most participants viewed the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors...however, several participants expressed concern that progress...might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
The committee questioned why financial conditions had not tightened despite recent rate rises and a few said equity prices were elevated.
U.S. stock prices were up slightly at the close of trade while yields on U.S. government debt dipped. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
Last month's 8-1 vote to lift the benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point, its second this year, signaled the Fed's confidence in a growing U.S. economy and the eventual inflationary effects of low unemployment.
In a press conference at the time, Fed Chair Janet Yellen described a recent decline in inflation as temporary and the central bank kept its forecast of one more rate rise this year and three the next.
Some policymakers since then, however, have shown increasing worry about the Fed's struggle to get inflation back to its 2 percent objective.
The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation slipped again in May to 1.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported on Friday, and has run below target for more than five years.
In the minutes, a few policymakers also said the inflation weakness made them less comfortable with the current implied path of rate hikes.
""These participants expressed concern that such a path of increases...might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation,"" according to the minutes.
""These views suggest that a third rate hike this year remains a solid base case, but also that such a hike is unlikely to come before the December meeting,"" said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro.
BALANCE SHEET CUTS EDGES CLOSER
The issue of when to begin reducing the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities and how it might affect deciding future rate rises also sparked debate.
At the June meeting, the Fed gave a clear outline of its plan this year to reduce its portfolio but gave no precise timing. The shedding of the bonds and other securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, marks the final chapter in the central bank's normalization of monetary policy.
Several Fed officials felt the reduction in the balance sheet and associated policy tightening ""was one basis for believing that...the target range for the federal funds rate would follow a less steep path than it otherwise would."" Some others, however, said the shedding of bonds should not figure heavily in deciding monetary policy.
Economists largely expect the Fed to begin shrinking its balance sheet at its September meeting before raising rates again at its final meeting of the year in December.

Investors also see the next rate increase occurring in December, according to Fed funds futures data compiled by the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). The rate-setting committee is next scheduled to meet to decide interest rate policy on July 25-26.

The minutes showed that the recent slowdown in inflation didn’t deter the Federal Reserve from its stance of raising rates gradually, as most members expect that inflation will rise to central bank’s target of 2% in 2019.

The minutes also showed that most Fed members supported the idea that the U.S. economy was strong enough to manage additional rate hikes.
“The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further”.
The Fed’s continued stance that the slowdown in inflation remains transitory and gradual rate hikes are appropriate supported an uptick in both the dollar and U.S. bond yields, adding to downside momentum in gold prices.
The dollar rose 0.19% to trade at 96.17 while the U.S. 10-Year pared losses to trade flat around 2.348.
Gold Futures, traded flat at $1,219.57.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion."

BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders has said he is ""reasonably confident"" that lower consumer spending will be offset by higher exports and investment, justifying his vote to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent.
But other economists are less sure, a stance the latest Markit/CIPS surveys of British businesses would seem to support.
Business expectations in the services sector sank in June to their weakest level since last summer's vote to leave the European Union, and they were not far off lows last reached in late 2011.
This gauge has been an early guide for the future performance of the investment intentions indicator of the BoE's monthly agents summary, which is often cited by members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Governor Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane both mentioned it in recent speeches. 
The PMI's index is strongly correlated with the indicator with about a four-month lead. http://reut.rs/2tQ3WuB
This suggests that recent progress in seen in the BoE's investment intentions indicator will reverse soon.
Last month's election setback for Prime Minister Theresa May, who lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 ballot, may have influenced the downturn in sentiment in services companies in June. But the overall trend is clear as the PMI's business expectations indicator has fallen in four of the last five months.
Official data on business investment are volatile from quarter to quarter. Last week the Office for National Statistics said it grew 0.6 percent in the first three months of 2017, only partially offsetting a fall in the fourth quarter.
The PMIs suggest another argument for higher interest rates - that exports will surge - may also be misplaced. 
The export orders gauge of Monday's manufacturing PMI slid to a five-month low in June.

While still indicating growth in exports, it left Britain as the weakest performer in terms of foreign orders - barring Greece - among big western European economies for a fourth month running.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in May, but orders for capital equipment were a bit stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a moderate growth path.
Factory goods orders dropped 0.8 percent, the Commerce
Department said on Wednesday after a revised 0.3 percent decline in April. It was the second straight monthly decrease in orders.
Economists had forecast factory orders falling 0.5 percent in May after a previously reported 0.2 percent drop in April. 
Factory orders were up 4.8 percent from a year ago.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the
U.S. economy, is losing momentum after gaining steam since mid-2016 amid a recovery in the energy sector that led to demand for oil and gas drilling equipment.
Activity is slowing against the backdrop of a moderation in oil prices and declining motor vehicle sales. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month, leading to a further increase in inventories, which could weigh on vehicle production.
The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies as investors awaited the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's June 13-14 policy meeting later in the day. 
U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. 
Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department also showed
orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen
as a measure of business spending plans - rising 0.2 percent instead of slipping 0.2 percent as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are 
used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross
domestic product report, nudged up 0.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent decrease.
Moderate capital expenditure comes despite relatively strong business confidence. A survey this week showed a measure of factory activity rising to a near three-year high in June.
In May, orders for machinery jumped 1.1 percent. Mining, oilfield and gas field machinery orders surged 8.5 percent. 
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.0 percent and orders for primary metals advanced 0.6 percent. Orders for transportation equipment fell 3.0 percent.
That was the biggest drop since last November and reflected an 11.6 percent tumble in non-defense aircraft orders. 
Motor vehicle orders gained 0.1 percent after rising 0.9 percent in April. 
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.2 percent after two straight monthly increases. Manufacturing inventories slipped 0.1 percent after rising for six consecutive months, while shipments gained 0.1 percent. 

The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.38

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies are giving ominous signs about the economy, just as the government embarks on European Union divorce negotiations, data showed on Wednesday, although momentum in the euro zone has lost some momentum.
A survey published on Wednesday suggested Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly pace of 0.4 percent in April-June. But its business expectations component tumbled to levels not seen since just after the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.
The euro zone's economy, meanwhile, probably grew nearly twice as fast, by 0.7 percent, during the second quarter. Business expectations dipped, but remained strong.
""This shouldn't come as a surprise,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) of the British findings. ""The UK is suffering the fallout from the Brexit (vote) of last year ... and has clearly moved onto a slower growth path.""
Disappointingly for some Bank of England officials who want to raise interest rates, IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index showed business expectations not far off the lows last reached in late 2011, with growth in new orders, which tend to signal future activity, at a nine-month low.
""Following on from weaker manufacturing and construction surveys, the softer services PMI points to an already-fragile economy faltering in June as heightened political and Brexit uncertainties fuel business and consumer caution,"" said Howard Archer at EY ITEM Club.
British Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June and so far there has been little clarity as to how the Brexit negotiations will proceed.
In contrast, across the euro zone backlogs of work increased as new business during June came in at the second-fastest rate in over six years.
Suggesting businesses in the bloc's dominant services industry remained confident, they sped up hiring last month, taking on staff at the second fastest rate since early 2008.
In other upbeat news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, retail sales increased by more than expected in May, European statistics office Eurostat said on Wednesday.
TWO PATHS
Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year as consumers faced both accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth.
Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment. Last month, three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase, although one of them has since left the BoE.
But the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.
""This weaker reading pours a degree of a cold water on the latest hawkish messages emanating from the Bank of England,"" said James Smith at ING.
The final composite PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good growth indicator, was 56.3 in June, down from May's 56.8 but comfortably beating a flash estimate of 55.7 and well into growth levels above 50.
Earlier PMIs from the bloc's big four economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy showed faster growth in the second quarter as a whole.
Britain's potential for being out of step can also be seen in monetary policy.

While the BoE is -- largely -- not expected to tinker with monetary policy anytime soon, the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to raise interest rates once more this year and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy-tightening.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is likely to lose momentum in the second half of 2017, according to a closely watched survey that could disappoint some Bank of England officials who want to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Sterling dipped after Wednesday's Markit/CIPS survey showed growth across British services companies fell to a four-month low in June.
Although the survey suggested the economy recovered some speed in the second quarter and probably expanded at a quarterly pace of around 0.4 percent, double the pace of the weak first quarter, there were some ominous signals in the PMI's forward-looking gauges.
Business expectations sank to their weakest level since last July's dip after the vote to leave the European Union, and it was not far off lows last reached in late 2011. Growth in new orders hit a nine-month low.
The headline index edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.
On Tuesday BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders said he was ""reasonably confident"" that lower consumer spending will be offset by higher exports and investment, justifying his vote to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent.
""But the latest PMI survey pours some cold water on that hypothesis,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Allan Monks.
""Indeed, it is worth highlighting that the weakness in the UK PMI comes at a time when the broader European PMIs have strengthened considerably.""
The mood among services firms was probably hit by uncertainty after June's election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority, and by Brexit talks, as well as the economic outlook, IHS Markit said.
A third monthly drop in car sales in June -- albeit from recent record highs -- underlined the slowdown among consumers.
Separate official data showed productivity, arguably Britain's biggest economic problem over the last decade, fell in the first three months of the year -- the first decline since late 2015.
The latest productivity data further complicates the outlook for BoE policymakers. Although weak productivity reduces the scope for future wage growth, it goes hand-in-hand with higher inflation.

""Unless more is done to tackle the nation's low productivity, people's wages and living standards will continue to fall and the UK will be ill-equipped to compete once we do leave the EU,"" said Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.

This was above a Reuters poll of 27 economists, which had on average forecast a 0.3 percent monthly rise and a 2.3 percent yearly increase.
The rise in sales was strongest in Latvia, Belgium and Estonia, while spending in Finland and Malta fell.
After a strong uptick of food, drinks and tobacco sales in April, euro zone consumers spent less on this category in May.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) decreased to 53.4 last month from a reading of 53.8 in May.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to only 53.5.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The report indicated that new business growth eased to a nine-month low and business optimism dropped to second-lowest since December 2011.
On the upside, job creation picked up to a 14-month high.
“Survey respondents cited anxiety related to the Brexit negotiations, alongside worries about the general economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty,” the report explained for the low levels of optimism.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson pointed out that all three PMI surveys had shown weakness.
He noted that while the data suggests growth of around 0.4% in the second quarter, “it’s clear that the economy heads into the third quarter losing momentum.”
“Given the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators, such as business optimism and order book growth, the risks are tilted towards the economy slowing in the third quarter,” Williamson concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2900 from around 1.2901 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8791 from 0.8798 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 146.53 compared to 146.47 previously.

LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses lost some momentum in June but chalked up their best performance last quarter in over six years, according to surveys that showed companies started the second half of 2017 in rude health.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 56.3 in June, down from May's 56.8 but comfortably beating a flash estimate of 55.7. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
""The final headline PMI came in above the earlier flash estimate and consequently signalled only a very slight loss of growth momentum at the end of the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the latest readings were indicative of the euro zone economy having grown 0.7 percent in the second quarter, faster than the 0.5 percent rate predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
Suggesting the momentum might be regained this month, backlogs of work increased as new business during June came in at the second-fastest rate in over six years. The sub-index nudged up to 56.0 from May's 55.9.
""The dip in the PMI in June certainly doesn't look like the start of a slowdown. The added encouragement to the healthy picture is the broad-based nature of the upturn signalled for economic growth, employment and prices,"" Williamson said.

Earlier PMIs from the bloc's big four economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy showed faster growth in the second quarter as a whole.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 55.4 from the previous month's 56.3 but was ahead of the 54.7 flash reading.
Suggesting businesses remained confident, they sped up hiring last month. The services employment index rose to 53.9 and has only been higher once - in March - since early 2008."

The findings reinforced analyst views that the world's second-largest economy is cooling after a strong start to the year, as Beijing cracks down on easy credit to contain a dangerous build-up in debt and defuse financial risks.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 51.6 in June from 52.8 in May, when a surprise rebound broke four straight months of declines. The June figure marks the second-lowest business activity level for service providers in over a year.
Subdued demand was behind the latest slowdown, as the new business sub-index weakened to 51.9 in June from May's 53.5, hitting its lowest since May 2016.
Analysts remain convinced that as deleveraging efforts persist, China's economy will take a hit. They expect quarterly economic growth to have slowed in the second quarter from 6.9 percent in January-March. The government has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for this year.
""Even though the impact of slowing expansion in China's services sector was cushioned by a slight rebound in manufacturing activity, the downward trend in the economy remains entrenched,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group in an accompanying note to the data.
Profit margins also appeared to be under pressure, with services companies only able to pass on a marginal portion of their input costs to consumers, although the rate at which costs are rising slowed in June.
As a result, the rate of job creation in the services sector fell further in June to its slowest in 10 months.
China is counting on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to lessen the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment. The sector accounts for more than half of China's gross domestic product.
The Caixin findings contrast with an official survey last week which pointed to accelerated growth and stronger demand in services, supported by robust expansion in financial services and construction sectors.
The divergence suggests the environment facing large parts of China's service providers who dominate sectors such as catering and accommodation are less rosy, as they have entered the most challenging funding environment in years.
A similar Caixin survey on Monday showed the manufacturing sector unexpectedly expanded in June as new orders and production rose in a sign of a modest recovery. It suggested much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, benefiting mainly large state-owned firms.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, fell to 51.1 in June from 51.5 in May, signaling the lowest overall growth momentum since June 2016.

The Bank of England is watching gauges of inflation pressure in Britain's economy closely as it considers whether to raise interest rates from their record low level.

Since the start of the year, car makers have sold 1.04 million vehicles in Canada, up 5 percent from the same time frame a year ago and the first time over a million new vehicles have been purchased in the first half of the year, DesRosiers said.
In contrast, U.S. auto sales fell for a fourth consecutive month in June, despite hefty consumer discounts, the major automakers reported on Monday.

The increase in sales of pickup trucks points to improving business investment prospects in the country's energy sector, said Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report highlighted that the pullback was due to weaker rises in new orders and employment and that business optimism hit its lowest point so far in 2017.
IHS Markit senior economist Tim Moore further noted that was a growth slowdown due to weaker rises in commercial building and civil engineering activity but that residential construction work continued to increase at one of the fastest rates since the end of 2015.
“Survey respondents commented on renewed caution among clients, in response to heightened political and economic uncertainty,” Moore said.
“While construction firms remain upbeat overall about their near-term growth prospects, the degree of confidence fell to its lowest so far this year,” he added.
Moore also indicated that supply chain pressures were among the most intense since early-2015 and commented that June data showed strong input price inflation, “driven by resilient demand and upward pressure on costs imported construction materials.”
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.2922 compared to 1.2934 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8785 compared to 0.8778 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded mostly lower. London’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.15%, the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.25%, France's CAC 40 traded down 0.16%, while Germany's DAX fell 0.29%."

For the full-text statement, see:
Media Release Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:
Number2017-13Date4 July 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The broad-based pick-up in the global economy is continuing. Labour markets have tightened further in many countries and forecasts for global growth have been revised up since last year. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth is being supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, with the high level of debt continuing to present a medium-term risk. The rise in commodity prices over the past year has boosted Australia's national income.
Headline inflation rates, having moved higher over the past year, have declined recently in response to lower oil prices. Wage growth remains subdued in most countries, as does core inflation. Further increases in US interest rates are expected and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively and volatility has been low.
As expected, GDP growth slowed in the March quarter, partly reflecting temporary factors. The Australian economy is expected to strengthen gradually, with the transition to lower levels of mining investment following the mining investment boom almost complete. Business conditions have improved and capacity utilisation has increased. Business investment has picked up in those parts of the country not directly affected by the decline in mining investment. At the same time, consumption growth remains subdued, reflecting slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt.
Indicators of the labour market remain mixed. Employment growth has been stronger over recent months. The various forward-looking indicators point to continued growth in employment over the period ahead. Wage growth remains low, however, and this is likely to continue for a while yet. Inflation is expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthens.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Conditions in the housing market vary considerably around the country. Housing prices have been rising briskly in some markets, although there are some signs that these conditions are starting to ease. In some other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Rent increases are the slowest for two decades. Growth in housing debt has outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. The recent supervisory measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of household indebtedness. Lenders have also announced increases in mortgage rates for investor and interest-only loans.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' inflation expectations picked up slightly in June from three months ago as labor shortages and high material costs pointed to an acceleration in consumer prices over the next few quarters.
Companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan expect consumer prices to rise 0.8 percent a year from now, higher than their projection for a 0.7 percent increase three months ago.
Companies also expect consumer prices to rise an annual 1.1 percent three years from now, up from a 1.0 percent annual increase seen in the previous BOJ survey.
The data come one day after the BOJ's tankan survey on corporate sentiment showed big manufactures are the most confident in three years, offering some hope that prices will rise, albeit at a gradual pace.
""Labor shortages will push up inflation expectations over time,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""However, this is a slow process, so the BOJ's monetary policy will be on hold for the time being.""
Core consumer prices, which include oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in April, data last week showed.
However, consumer prices were unchanged in May after stripping out the effect of energy costs, underscoring the BOJ's struggles to push inflation to its 2 percent target.
The BOJ is likely to cut its consumer price forecast for the current fiscal year at a quarter review of its projections in July, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters.
However, a slight uptick in inflation expectations, combined with increased optimism in the corporate sector, could give the BOJ reason to keep its longer-term price forecasts unchanged,

The BOJ started the survey on corporate price expectations from the tankan in March 2014 to gather more information on inflation expectations, key to its current stimulus program.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Consumer inflation in South Korea eased slightly in June as falling utility costs offset soaring fresh food prices, government data showed on Tuesday, with the overall price impulse suggesting a steady improvement in consumption and broad economic growth.
The consumer price index rose 1.9 percent in June from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, down from the 2 percent increase in May, and lagging the 2.0 percent forecast in a Reuters poll
The index declined 0.1 percent a month earlier, after edging up 0.1 percent in May.
Asia's fourth largest economy grew at its quickest pace in six quarters in January-March period, thanks to robust construction sector activity and exports. Moderate price pressure near the BOK's target of 2 percent since early this year suggested private consumption is steadily improving.
""Agricultural product prices have been volatile, but gains in service costs have been sustaining the overall price pressure,"" Park Jung-woo, an economist at Korea Investment and Securities said.
Tuesday's data showed the costs for electricity, gas and tap water declined 1.6 percent on-year. That was partly offset by inflation from fresh food products, which stood at 10.5 percent in June, reflecting rapidly rising egg prices sparked by an outbreak of avian influenza
Service costs gained 1.9 percent in June from a year earlier, driven by a 9.1 percent surge in package tourism costs and a 19.5 percent jump in insurance premium fees, the report showed.
""Inflation is expected hover around 2 percent throughout this year, and won't accelerate much further to a level that calls for a change in monetary policies,"" Park said, adding that he believes the Bank of Korea to keep the base rate at a record-low 1.25 percent for the time being.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, was up 1.4 percent, after similar growth in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity rose sharply in June to its highest level in almost three years suggesting economic growth in the second quarter gained some steam, while construction spending held steady in May.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 57.8 last month, its best performance since August 2014, from 54.9 in May.
A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 12 percent of the overall U.S. economy.
""The ISM index provides further evidence that the prospects for the manufacturing sector remain bright,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
The reading adds to encouraging signs that the U.S. economy rebounded strongly in the April-June quarter. Following the data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 3.0 percent annualized rate from its previous forecast of 2.7 percent.
On Friday, the Commerce Department also reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less slowly than previously estimated.
The ISM survey's new orders sub-index rose to 63.5 in June from 59.5 the prior month. A measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 57.2 from 53.5 in May.
According to ISM, comments from those surveyed generally reflected expanding conditions, ""with new orders, production, employment, backlog and exports all growing in June compared to May and with supplier deliveries and inventories struggling to keep up with the production pace."" Fifteen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in June. 
Another survey released on Monday, the Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, gave its lowest reading since last September
The dollar rose to a session high against a basket of currencies after the ISM data, while the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose to a more than eight-year high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high.
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING MIXED
Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly remained flat in May but federal government outlays on construction projects were the highest in more than four years. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending in May remained unchanged at $1.23 trillion. Spending in April was revised to show it declining 0.7 percent after a previously reported 1.4 percent fall.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.3 percent in May. Construction spending increased 4.5 percent from a year ago.
Federal government construction spending jumped 6.4 percent in May to its highest level since January 2013.
The May construction spending release included revisions to data back to January 2015, the Commerce Department said.
In May, private construction spending fell 0.6 percent, the biggest decline since October 2015, after declining 0.2 percent in April. Investment in private residential construction also declined 0.6 percent, the biggest fall since July 2014, after rising 0.5 percent the prior month.
Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 0.7 percent in May, the fifth straight monthly decline.
Investment in public construction projects rose 2.1 percent in May after dropping 2.7 percent in April.

Outlays on state and local government construction projects increased 1.7 percent in May after falling 2.7 percent in April.

The cumulative January-June deficit was 50.188 billion euros, some 22.5 billion more than in the first six months of 2016.
The Treasury said the size of the June 2017 deficit was affected by the 4.8 billion-euro costs of winding up two failed regional banks in the Veneto region and the delay of tax receipts amounting to about 13 billion euros.

The Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52.3 in June from 51.2 in May when adjusted for seasonal swings, hitting its highest since May 2016.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that points to contraction.
""The latest PMI survey provides a positive signal for near-term growth momentum across the Mexican manufacturing sector,"" senior IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said in a statement.
Moore noted the rebound followed a sluggish period early this year where the PMI headline rate was close to its lowest reading in three years.
Higher sales volumes pushed the rate of employment growth to a 14-month high, while input price inflation was down from a peak early this year after the peso sank to a record low.
But the peso has bounced back and business confidence has improved as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and moved toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and TVs, to the United States.

The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

“Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April,” the ISM noted.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - British factories were left out of a demand-driven surge in activity across much of Asia and Europe in June, as weakness in sterling failed to translate into export growth, surveys showed.
Factories in the euro zone rounded off the first half of 2017 by ramping up at the fastest rate for over six years while Asia's tech-manufacturing economies were helped by growing global demand for electronics products.
But British manufacturing grew more slowly than anyone polled by Reuters expected as consumers faced the double-hit of accelerating inflation - caused in large part by the fall in the pound since last year's vote to leave the EU - and slowing wage growth.
Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weakened pound - more competitive exports - is proving elusive and could make Bank of England officials think twice about raising interest rates.
The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.3 from a downwardly-revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a reading of 56.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
""The decline in the PMI in June robustly challenges hopes that manufacturing and exports will pick up and offset the consumer spending slowdown. Today's manufacturing report weakens the case for raising interest rates soon,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
June's manufacturing PMI for the euro zone rose to 57.4, its highest since April 2011 and up from May's 57.0.
Suggesting the bloc's momentum will continue into the second half, new orders rose at the fastest rate since early 2011, backlogs of work increased at the fastest pace in over 13 years, raw materials were depleted and factories increased headcount at a near-record pace.
The upturn came alongside factories increasing prices, as they have done for nine months, welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been battling for years to get inflation back to their 2 percent target ceiling.
Inflation was a stronger-than-expected 1.3 percent in June, official flash data showed on Friday, and while still below target, recent strong economic data meant ECB chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy tightening.
In Britain, central banker have started to signal that a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching to help curb the sharp rise in inflation.
BoE Governor Mark Carney says he is watching to see how the economy copes with the launch of Brexit talks and whether weakness among consumers could be offset by investment and exports.
ASIA ACCELERATION 
Private sector surveys of manufacturers in Asia showed factories in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan picked up in June, driven largely by a recovery in exports.
But continued declines in energy prices, which weighed on manufacturing in Indonesia and Malaysia, could hurt these two economies, while in India, sluggish domestic demand offset strong foreign demand and led to a slowdown.
Factory PMIs for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan Vietnam and India all remained above 50. And all of them, except for Japan and India, rose from May. 
""But the ability for manufacturers to continue to accelerate, or to maintain sharp surges in production, is in question given underlying demand, apart from some bright spots, doesn't seem to have permeated more widely across the different sectors,"" said Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Bank.
While manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in three months in June in China, business confidence slumped to its lowest level this year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions.
""We believe cyclical momentum (in China) has likely peaked and will ease further due to tighter financial conditions,"" Yin Zhang and Helen Qiao at Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. 
""Looking ahead, since overall growth is still higher than the policy target level at around 6.5 percent for real GDP, we expect policy makers to maintain the tightening bias in (the second half), which is likely to impose downward pressure on growth until early 2018.""
In Japan, confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest level in over three years in June, according to a survey from the central bank published on Monday.

LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Factories across the euro zone rounded off the first half of 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest rate for over six years as rising prices failed to put a dent in orders, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.4 in June, up from May's 57.0 and pipping the preliminary reading of 57.3.
June's reading was the highest since April 2011 and was comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday, jumped to 58.7 from 58.3 - a level not seen in over six years.
""Euro zone manufacturing growth gained further momentum in June, rounding off the best quarter for just over six years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Suggesting the momentum will continue into the second half, new orders rose at the fastest rate since early 2011, backlogs of work increased at the fastest pace in over 13 years, raw materials were depleted and factories increased headcount at a near record pace.
That meant manufacturers were at their most optimistic for at least five years. The future output index, which gauges expectations, soared to 67.4 from 66.0 - the highest level in the sub-index's history.
""There's no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon. The manufacturing sector is clearly in expansion mode and looks poised for continued robust growth in coming months,"" Williamson said.
The upturn came alongside factories increasing prices, as they have done for nine months, welcome news to policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been battling for years to get inflation to their 2 percent target ceiling.
Inflation was a stronger-than-expected 1.3 percent in June, official flash data showed on Friday, and while still below target the strong economic data of late meant ECB chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy-tightening.

LONDON (Reuters) - British factories grew more slowly than expected in June as export orders rose at the weakest pace in five months, according to a survey on Monday that might disappoint Bank of England officials who favor raising interest rates.
Sterling, which jumped last week on expectations of a BoE shift towards higher borrowing costs, fell after the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) slipped to 54.3 from a downwardly revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low.
The reading was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 56.5.
It also contrasted with a sharp pick-up in growth for factories in the euro zone.
Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year, with consumers facing the double hit of accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth.
Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment and two of the sitting eight monetary policymakers voted last month for a rate hike. A third supporter of a hike has since left the BoE. 
However, Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weak currency - more competitive exports - is proving elusive, even as the global economy picks up.
The PMI showed export orders rose last month at the weakest pace since January.
""While the survey data add to signs that the economy is likely to have shown stronger growth in the second quarter, further doubts are raised as to whether this performance can be sustained into the second half of the year,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit.
""Export orders remained disappointingly lackluster despite the ongoing competitiveness boost of the weak sterling exchange rate.""
The EEF, a lobby group representing manufacturers, said the sector would probably provide a counterweight to a slowing in Britain's far bigger services sector, but employers were wary about the political outlook after Prime Minister Theresa May was left weakened by last month's inconclusive election outcome.
""The build-up in political uncertainty looks to be dampening sentiment in the sector somewhat,"" George Nikolaidis, an EEF economist, said.
An Institute of Directors survey published in June showed business confidence fell sharply after May lost her parliamentary majority the election.

Monday's PMI showed price pressures for manufacturing firms eased in June, which could help ease the squeeze on profit margins. However, optimism sank to an seven-month low.Among investment goods manufacturers, who are critical to the recovery in investment expected by the BoE, optimism fell to its lowest level since last July.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 54.3 last month from a final reading of 56.3 in May.
Analysts had expected the PMI to decline to 56.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit noted that the headline number hit a three-month low while the growth rates of output and new orders slowed.
The research group also highlighted that price inflationary pressures eased.
“The UK manufacturing sector largely weathered the uncertainty of a general election and start of formal Brexit negotiations to eke out further output growth at the end of the second quarter,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“However, the rate of expansion eased again in June, with growth weakening across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries,” he added.
Dobson explained that the main factor driving the broad slowdown in June was a steep easing in the rate of increase in new order intakes.
“While the survey data add to signs that the economy is likely to have shown stronger growth in the second quarter, further doubts are raised as to whether this performance can be sustained into the second half of the year,” he concluded.
After the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2972 from around 1.2988 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8775 compared to 0.8764 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 146.41 compared to 146.61 earlier.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2017 04:06AM ET</span>",German factory growth reaches 74-month high in June: PMI,"BERLIN, JULY 3 (Reuters) - German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June, driven by a sharp increase in orders, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting factories will contribute to an expansion in the second quarter.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 59.6 from 59.5 in May to reach its highest level in 74 months.
That was higher than a flash reading of 59.3 and well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
""German manufacturers turned out another impressive performance in June with the PMI rising for the sixth time in seven months to the highest since April 2011,"" said Markit economist Trevor Balchin.
He added: ""The latest PMI data therefore strongly suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to boost German GDP in the second quarter.""
High input prices, which are seen as a threat to the momentum in the sector, eased in June, Markit said. Input price inflation fell from April's 71-month record to the weakest since November 2016. However, it remained higher than the long-run survey average mainly because of higher raw material prices.
Data last week showed German consumer inflation had accelerated unexpectedly in June driven by higher costs for food and services. The figures suggested a solid upswing in Europe's largest economy is slowly pushing up underlying price pressures.
The German economy is enjoying a consumption-driven upswing supported by a robust labor market and an environment of low borrowing costs.
The pace of job creation in the manufacturing sector slowed slightly in June from May's six-year high but firms continued to report having to expand capacity to meet demand.
Manufacturers were also increasingly optimistic regarding the outlook for production and some said they expect stronger demand from Asia and the Middle East.

The Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) headline reading fell to 50.3 last month from 52.4 in May, holding narrowly above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
Economists are watching for clues as to the depth and breadth of economic recovery in Russia.
Industrial output data have been strong in recent months, but retail sales have stayed weak.
""June's PMI reading confirms that momentum has faded, which bodes ill for growth throughout the rest of the year,"" said Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The survey showed levels of employment and new export orders in the manufacturing sector fell. But business confidence remained strong, hitting a three-month high in June.

The private survey came in at 50.4, marking a three-month high. It was up from May's 49.6, which was an 11-month low, and beat a Reuters poll forecast for 49.5.
Levels above 50 signal an expansion, while levels below 50 indicate contraction.
The Caixin PMI tends to focus on smaller, private companies, while the official data tends to focus on larger, often state-owned companies.
The rise was spurred by stronger increases in production and new orders. The June Caixin PMI wasn't all positive, with the release saying the optimism toward the business outlook touched its lowest level so far this year.
But the improved data offered confirmation of the official PMI figures, released on Friday, which showed that manufacturing activity accelerated more than expected in June.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.7 in June, accelerating from May's 51.2 and beating a Reuters poll forecast for 51.0.
In the services sector, the official services PMI for June rose to 54.9 from May's 54.5.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2017 09:50PM ET</span>","China factories recover in June, growth fastest in three months - Caixin PMI","BEIJING, July 3 (Reuters) - China's manufacturing engine cranked back into growth mode in June, expanding at the fastest pace in three months after unexpectedly contracting in May, as new orders and production rose in a sign of a modest recovery, a private survey showed on Monday.
Yet, even as markets welcome the recovery in factory activity, firms showed a reluctance to restock as business confidence slumped to the lowest for the year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in June, above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
That was well above the 49.5 level forecast by 25 analysts in a Reuters survey, and up from May's reading of 49.6, the first contraction in 11 months.
Improved orders helped nudge activity into expansionary territory, even though firms surveyed noted demand still remained relatively subdued both in domestic and international markets.
Total new orders rose to 51.0 - the highest level in three months - from the previous month's 50.3, with new export orders also rising. The rate of expansion in production also quickened in June, and the pace of job shedding - which has been persistent since late 2013 - eased to the slowest in three months.
Chinese manufacturers' confidence about the 12-month outlook for production fell to the lowest level this year, the survey showed. And while businesses still remained generally optimistic, the overall mood was one of caution, underscoring challenges faced by companies as higher borrowing rates raise the costs of financing.
The Caixin readings were echoed by the official PMI on Friday which also showed surprisingly robust growth in China's manufacturing sector, but the official data was still much more bullish compared to the private survey which tends to focus on smaller firms.
The divergence suggests that much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, benefiting mainly large state-owned firms, as worsening financing conditions have in particular added to struggling smaller firms' plight.
PRESSURE ON GROWTH
Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), forming the bulk of the country's private investors, contribute about 60 percent of China's industrial output and create 80 percent of China's jobs. But many of them are expected to go out of business this year, as profits shrank and bankruptcies rise.
That reinforced analyst views that economic growth is likely to slow in coming quarters given continued government efforts to rein in debt risks through a concerted deleveraging effort.
""The June reading was more like a rebound, with an economic downtrend likely to be confirmed later,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release.
Operationally, firms signaled further strain, highlighted by a sustained increase in backlogs of work, the survey found.
Companies adopted a relatively cautious stance towards their inventories, with both stocks of inputs and finished items declining in the month in a sign firms have been reluctant to actively restock.
To make matters worse input prices rose on the back of higher raw material costs, suggesting a renewed pressure on operating margins.
While manufacturers were able to pass on part of the higher costs to consumers, the underlying picture was one of trying to grow profits under a challenging economic climate.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2017 09:42PM ET</span>",Japan firms most upbeat in three years but labor shortages weigh: BOJ tankan,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter, a closely-watched central bank survey showed, adding to signs the recovery in the world's third largest economy is gaining pace.
Big firms also saw the job market at its tightest in 25 years, offering policymakers some hope that companies may finally raise wages, helping broaden an economic recovery.
The survey underscores the Bank of Japan's view that the economy is heading for a moderate expansion, though sources say weak price and wage pressures are likely to force it to slash its inflation forecasts later this month.
The headline diffusion index (DI) measuring big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 17 in June, the BOJ's quarterly ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday, its third straight quarter of improvement and up from plus 12 in the previous survey in March.
This exceeded a median market forecast of plus 15 and was the highest since March 2014, as automakers and machinery firms benefited from robust demand in Asia.
""Taken together, the survey backs up the BOJ's optimism on the economy,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""But a gap remains between a strong economy and tepid inflation. If the BOJ revises down its price forecasts at the upcoming meeting, investors will recognize that an exit from ultra-loose monetary policy will be some time away.""
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index stood at plus 23, up from plus 20 in March and matching a median market, the tankan showed. It was the second straight quarter of improvement and the highest level since December 2015.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen slightly three months ahead, the survey showed, underscoring their concern on overseas economic uncertainties.
The tankan will be among factors the BOJ's nine-member board will scrutinize when it meets July 19-20 to review monetary policy and its quarterly growth and inflation estimates.
A separate survey showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at a slightly slower pace in June, though an upward revision to export orders suggests the factory sector remains on a firm footing.
SHORTAGE OF EMPLOYEES, CAPACITY
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and a boost from private consumption, prompting the BOJ to upgrade its economic assessment in April.
But consumer inflation remains subdued as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households, underscoring the scale of the challenge the BOJ faces in achieving its ambitious 2 percent target.
While companies remain wary of boosting wages or capital expenditure, there are signs of change as they face capacity shortages.
An index measuring big manufacturers' production capacity showed more of them now feel they face a shortage, rather than an excess, of facilities to produce goods.
Big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 8.0 percent in the current fiscal year to March 2018, exceeding market forecasts for a 7.4 percent rise, the survey showed.
An index measuring job conditions showed big firms saw the labor market at the tightest since 1992, the tankan showed, reinforcing views a shortage of employees was among the key concerns for many companies.
Japanese companies plan to increase hiring of new graduates by 8.1 percent in the next fiscal year beginning in April 2018, which would be the eighth straight year of gains, the tankan showed.

The tankan's sentiment diffusion indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The inaugural Commonwealth Bank and IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in June, from 55.9 in May and putting it well above the 50.0 threshold between expansion and contraction.
Its measure of services picked up to 57.0, from 54.8 in May, with 70 percent of respondents predicting faster growth for the year ahead.
Pressure on capacity prompted manufacturers to add jobs in the month, with the employment index near a five-month peak. Around two-thirds of respondents expected to raise output in the year ahead.
""The pressure on capacity evident in the survey responses is a positive indication for further jobs growth and brings us a step closer to the long-awaited lift in business capex,"" said CBA chief economist Michael Blythe.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank unexpectedly cut its key lending rate on Friday by 50 basis points in an effort to boost a sluggish economy, though policymakers were divided over the size of the reduction as inflation remained above target.
The seven-member board reduced the rate to 5.75 percent, meeting expectations of nine of 22 analysts in a Reuters survey published last week. The other 13 had predicted a cut of 25 basis points.
The board's vote was split, with four calling for the 50 basis point cut and the other three for a smaller reduction.
It was the sixth reduction in an easing cycle intended to bolster Latin America's fourth-largest economy, hit hard by the global fall in prices for crude oil as it struggles with high inflation.
Bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria, reading from a statement, said the board took the decision after considering the ""growing weakness of economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond that compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income caused by the fall in oil prices.""
They also discussed how recent economic indicators show that there is ""significant increase"" in excess capacity of the economy.
There was some uncertainty expressed over how quickly inflation would come down to the ideal level of 3 percent, the statement said.
Echavarria indicated earlier this month the rate could come down to as low as 5.25 percent by yearend, but the board has not been unanimous in a decision since late last year.
While policymakers are aware of the need to lower the cost of money to encourage consumer spending, it must ensure the decision does not end up stimulating inflation, which remains above the target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. The bank expects the economy to expand about 1.8 percent in 2017.
""We won't strangle the economy to achieve 3 percent now, we will get there at some point in 2018,"" Echavarria told reporters. He said the biggest complication to economic growth was now.
Inflation expectations for the close of this year were up to 4.30 percent in the Reuters poll. Annual inflation in May reached 4.37 percent.

The bank warned that the decline in food prices that has helped improve inflation - close to 9 percent a year ago - could be reversed, meaning consumer prices could rise during the second half.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion that could still lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by the end of the year.
The data, released by the Commerce Department on Friday, bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter, although a separate report showed a gauge of consumer confidence fell in June to its lowest level since November.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.1 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 1.4 percent on a yearly basis, compared to a 1.5 percent gain in April.
Yields on U.S. government debt rose and U.S. stock prices rose after the spending data was published. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies.
Some Fed policymakers are worried that inflation may fall further below the central bank's 2 percent target, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen said earlier this month that inflation would likely be soft in the coming months due to temporary factors. 
Solid consumer spending is supporting the outlook for faster inflation and continued economic growth. The slower spending growth in May followed two monthly increases of 0.4 percent, which suggests economic growth is on track to accelerate in the second quarter after a meager expansion in the first three months of the year.
""It still looks like real consumption picked up lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent in May from April, dragged lower by drops in prices for consumer goods and energy. When food and energy were excluded, the index was up 0.1 percent.
The 12-month reading for the so-called core inflation has been slowing since March.
The slowdown in inflation has boosted consumer spending power. After-tax personal income adjusted for inflation rose 0.6 percent in May, the largest gain since April 2015.

Even so, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 95.1 this month, its lowest since November, according to a final reading for the gauge published on Friday. The index has been rising more or less steadily since 2008 and in November it hit its highest level since before the 2007-09 recession.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and offering the central bank some hope a strengthening economy will gradually lift inflation toward its ambitious 2 percent target.
But recent declines in oil costs and stubbornly slow wage growth could cloud the outlook and force the Bank of Japan next month to cut its rosy inflation projections yet again, some analysts say.
Separate data showed household spending fell 0.1 percent in May from a year earlier even as job availability was at its highest in 43 years, a sign that the tightening job market has yet to give a lasting boost to wages and consumption.
Japan's jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 3.1 percent in May, while the availability of jobs rose for the third straight month to reach the highest since February 1974, data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed.
The government said May's rise in the unemployment rate was the first increase since November last year and was due largely to workers resigning to seek better jobs and new entrants joining the labor market.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, followed a 0.3 percent gain in April and matched a median market forecast.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were unchanged in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, against a 0.2 percent gain projected in a Reuters poll.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and a boost from private consumption, prompting the BOJ to upgrade its economic assessment in April.
But consumer inflation remains subdued with companies wary of raising their prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households, underscoring the challenge for the BOJ in driving up inflation to its 2 percent target.
The BOJ is set to upgrade its economic assessment again but cut its inflation forecast at a quarterly review of its projections in July, sources have told Reuters.

After three years of heavy asset buying failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework last year to one better suited for a long-term battle to beat deflation.

A monthly measure of consumer confidence published by market research firm GfK sank to -10, weaker than a median forecast of -7 in a Reuters poll of economists. 
It was the lowest reading since last July's -12, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
""Strong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit-induced economic slowdown,"" Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
A measure of how willing consumers are to buy expensive items slumped to +1 from +9 in May, potentially raising alarm bells for retailers.
The survey chimed with another measure of consumer confidence published by polling firm YouGov earlier this week which pinned the gloomier mood on Britain's messy election outcome and a weakening of the housing market.
Britain's economy initially withstood the impact of the decision to leave EU. But the growing pressure on spending power from a weaker currency that is pushing up inflation caused a sharp slowdown in growth earlier this year.
Inflation is expected to breach 3 percent soon while wage growth has slowed to below 2 percent.
The Bank of England thinks there will be a pick-up in investment by business and in exports which will offset much of the drag from lower spending by consumers, potentially paving the way for its first interest rate hike in a decade.
Official data due to be published at 0830 GMT on Friday are expected to confirm economic growth of just 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2017 compared with the final quarter of 2016.
Economists are also watching for a reading of Britain's huge services sector performed during April which, could help show whether the economy recovered any of its momentum at the start of the second quarter.

The GfK index is based on a survey of 2,000 people carried out between June 1 and June 15 for the European Commission.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less than feared in the first quarter due largely to a jump in consumer spending, providing a slightly more encouraging outlook for growth this year.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the 1.2 percent reported last month, the Commerce Department said in its final assessment for the period on Thursday.
The reading was the worst since the second quarter of 2016 but above analysts' expectations, easing fears the economy had been hobbled at the start of this year. The government had pegged first-quarter growth at a paltry 0.7 percent in its first estimate in April.
""The upward revision occurred even with a downward revision to the inventory data, which has favorable implications for the adding up of second-quarter growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to be unrevised at 1.2 percent in the first quarter. The economy tends to underperform in that period relative to the rest of the year due to perennial issues with the calculation of the data. The government has said it is working to resolve those issues.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) briefly edged up after the release of the data before retracing earlier losses against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower and stocks on Wall Street were down sharply.
First-quarter economic growth was boosted by an upward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent pace, the weakest reading since the second quarter of 2013 but almost double the 0.6 percent reported last month.
Despite the upward revision to GDP, the Trump administration's stated target of swiftly boosting annual U.S. economic growth to 3 percent remains a challenge.
A sustained average growth rate of 3 percent has not been achieved in the United States since the 1990s. The U.S. economy has grown an average 2 percent since 2000 and it expanded only 1.6 percent in 2016, which was the weakest growth in five years.
President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground five months into his presidency.
Details of the White House's tax plan remain sparse as Trump advisers attempt to win over fiscally conservative Republicans in Congress who want any changes to ultimately be revenue-neutral. 
Initial signs that economic growth re-accelerated sharply in the second quarter have also faltered in the face of recent disappointing data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation. Housing data has also been mixed.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting annualized growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter.
LABOR MARKET STILL STRONG
Other data on Thursday showed the job market was still flashing a green light.
The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose slightly, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low in May. 
U.S. exporters also flexed more muscle in the first quarter. Exports for the period were revised to show a 7.0 percent rate of growth from the previously reported 5.8 percent. Exports in the fourth quarter fell at a rate of 4.5 percent.
Business spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a rate of 7.8 percent in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated.
Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, rather than the $4.3 billion reported last month. Inventory investment rose at a rate of $49.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
Inventories subtracted 1.11 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter instead of the 1.07 percentage point previously reported.

The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the prior three months.

GDP, the value of everything produced in America, increased by 1.4%, a third estimate released on Thursday showed. Consumer spending, the largest part of the economy, and exports were revised higher, although the broader picture of economic growth remained the same.
The US economy enters its ninth year of expansion in July.
GDP was forecast to be unrevised at 1.2%, according to Bloomberg. It was initially reported at 0.7%.
Some economists suspect that this still underestimates the pace of growth in the US as the Commerce Department has done in every first quarter of this recovery. That's because of residual seasonality, a quirk that distorts how temporary factors like the weather are accounted for.
Fed participants who decide on monetary policy said in minutes of their May meeting that they thought seasonality at least played a role. They raised interest rates in June, seeing the slowdown as transitory.
The third estimate of GDP ""will not be the final word on the subject,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on Thursday. ""Indeed, there never will be a final word, because the numbers are revised indefinitely into the future. No wonder the Fed prefers to look at payroll growth as a better proxy for the state of the economy; you can never be sure that the GDP numbers are reliable, especially when looking at short periods.""

Germany’s annual inflation rate rose to 1.6% in June from a final reading of 1.5% in May, the federal statistics office Destatis said in a preliminary estimate.
Economists had forecast an inflation rate of 1.4% for June.
EU-harmonised annual inflation (HICP) rose to 1.5% in June from 1.4% in May.
Regional data released earlier on Thursday showed that annual inflation rose to 1.9% in the German state of Hesse, up from 1.7% in May.
Consumer prices ticked higher in Saxony, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg and remained stable in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria.
The data comes as pressure from Germany and other countries has been mounting on the European Central Bank to start to unwind its quantitative easing program.
Inflation in the euro area’s largest economy rose above the ECB’s target of “below but close to” 2% in February. It fell back in March, but then rose again to hit the target in April.

The data comes only days after ECB head Mario Draghi hinted that the bank's asset-purchase program would become less accommodative going into 2018 as regional growth gains pace and inflation trends return following a period of falling prices.
In another sign of rising price pressures in the 19-member single currency bloc, Spanish consumer prices rose more than expected in June, preliminary figures showed on Thursday.
In the German state of Hesse, annual inflation rose to 1.9 percent in June from 1.7 percent in May, the data showed. It also edged up in Saxony, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg while it remained stable in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT.
A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested EU-harmonized consumer price inflation fell to 1.3 percent in June from 1.4 percent in May.
Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the state readings now suggested that German inflation edged up in June to 1.5 percent, adding that price pressure would rise further in the coming months due to the robust German labor market.
""This will offer some comfort to the ECB, which has stressed that a sustained increase in underlying inflation is a key condition for policy normalization to begin,"" she added.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>","China factory activity seen cooling in June, crackdown on debt risks drag","BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China is expected to have cooled slightly in June from the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, as manufacturers are pressured by government efforts to reduce high levels of debt across the world's second-biggest economy. 
Most analysts agree that Beijing's crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions will slow China's momentum after a strong start to the year when first quarter growth came in at 6.9 percent. 
Corporates are already facing higher financing costs, which could ripple through to decisions on investment, hiring, and wages over the next year. 
Moreover, a raft of property curbs have effectively cooled sales in the biggest cities and started dragging on property investment. Indeed, investment growth in the real estate sector slowed for the first time in three months in May.
That could hurt the construction sector - a big boon for the economy in the past few quarters.
""We believe that deleveraging has continued in June and it had some cooling impact on the economy,"" said Kelvin Lau, senior economist for Greater China at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).
""We are also taking into account the cooling measures on the real estate sector.""
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to come in at 51.0, which would be the lowest reading since September though capping the eleventh straight month of growth, according to a median forecast of 34 economists polled by Reuters.
The index stabilized at 51.2 in the months of April and May, after hitting 51.8 in March - its highest level in nearly five years.
Interestingly, the official PMI survey, which will be released on June 30, along with the official services PMI, showed a divergence with the private Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey in May, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms.
The private survey, due on July 3, showed the sector struggling to motor on - a contradiction that analysts suspected showed heavy industry was the biggest beneficiary of a construction boom and government stimulus support. 
China's economy generally remained on a solid footing in May, with profits at industrial companies bouncing back from April. 
China's export growth more than halved in May, in line with a general cooling in demand for electronic gadgets. But while trade friction between China and some key trading partners remains, an overall improvement in global growth means shipments from the world's largest exporter will likely remain strong this year.
And analysts say Beijing will be keen to keep key sectors of the economy growing at a steady pace so it can meet its full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent, down from 6.7 percent in 2016 - the slowest annual pace in 26 years.
All the same, the challenges for policymakers are aplenty. 
Producer price inflation (PPI), for instance, fell for the third straight month in May on tumbling prices of raw materials, reinforcing expectations of a slowdown that would be bad news for debt-laden firms.

Massive debt - standing at nearly 300 percent of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can't carry on pump priming - factors that analysts say will eventually drag on growth during the year.

The rate was well below the median forecast in a Reuters poll for 2.0 percent growth.
Economic activity in April was flat compared with March, Indec said. Latin America's No. 3 economy grew a cumulative 0.4 percent in the first four months of the year compared with the same period a year earlier, when Argentina was in the midst of a deep recession.
The government expects growth of around 3 percent this year, after a contraction of 2.2 percent in 2016. President Mauricio Macri has increased infrastructure spending and cut export taxes on the key farming sector to try to boost output, but a promised wave of foreign investment has been slow to arrive.
April's figure marked a deceleration from March, when economic activity grew 1.3 percent year-on-year - revised upwards from the 0.8 percent rate published last month - and 1.5 percent compared with February, revised downwards from the 1.9 percent rate published last month.
The construction sector, linked in part to public works, grew 8.4 percent year-on-year in April and agricultural output grew 4.6 percent. Industrial activity fell 1.9 percent, however, while retail and wholesale commerce declined 2.2 percent as 24 percent 12-month inflation ate into consumers' purchasing power.

The quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) showed that while the property sector slowed, manufacturing improved further and the retail and services industries bounced back after a difficult first quarter.
That reinforced a flurry of recent data and policy makers' comments that indicated authorities were working to curb financial risks and keep the economy on an even keel heading into a key political meeting this year. 
The survey showed surprisingly strong performance in the commodities sector despite some price weakness in the second quarter, with the aluminum sector particularly strong. 
The improving economy, especially the healthy labor market, is no doubt welcome news ahead of a leadership revamp at an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China. 
Yet signs of stress in the corporate sector pointed to a bumpy ride for businesses. CBB said cash flow was negative for many companies and inventory levels in the second quarter was at the highest in the history of the survey. 
That is in line with official data showing growth in industrial inventories picked up to over 10 percent in April, sparking worries of weak demand.
CBB said there are signs tougher times could be ahead for Chinese companies during a period of deleveraging and rising interest rates. 
""It remains true that either rates have to come plunging back down, as the (state planner) recently called for, or the present level of corporate activity is headed for a cliff,"" CBB said in its report. 
As the government stepped up its campaign to curb debt risks and stabilize the financial sector, growth of China's broad money supply came in at the slowest in at least two decades in May, though bank lending remained solid.
The CBB survey showed the corporate sector started to feel the effect of tighter credit conditions in the second quarter after escaping relatively unscathed in the first three months of the year, with the cost to take a bank loan the highest since 2014. 
But borrowing was not impacted much, CBB said, likely due to firms' positive business outlook for the next six months, though CBB said that this may not last if tightening persists. 

""Companies assume deleveraging is transient, likely because they are skeptical the Party will allow economic pain in 2017. It will not be until 2018 when we find out whether deleveraging is genuine—because it won't be until 2018 that it will actually hurt"", CBB said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. single-family home prices rose in April due to tight inventory of houses on the market and low mortgage rates, a survey showed on Tuesday, and economists see no imminent change in the trend.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in April on a year-over-year basis after a 5.9 percent gain in March, which matched the fastest pace in nearly three years. April's result fell short of the 5.9 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Despite coming in below expectations, David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the supply of homes has barely kept up with demand and inventory of new or existing homes for sale had diminished to a 4-month supply. That is likely to keep home prices on the rise.
""We hear that developers are having trouble finding the lots they want and finding the labor they want. With those two constraints, inventory is going to stay tight for a while,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA). 
The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the inventory of existing homes available for sale rose in May by 2.1 percent to 1.96 million from the previous month. Still, that was 8.4 percent below last year's level, and inventory has declined for consecutive 24 months on a year-over-year basis.
Prices in the 20 cities covered by Case-Shiller rose 0.3 percent in April after seasonal adjustment, the survey showed, short of expectations for a 0.4 percent increase. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, prices increased 0.9 percent from March. 
Secondary tech hubs like Seattle, Portland and Dallas reported the highest annual gains among the 20 metropolitan areas measured by the index. 
""We're getting affordability issues in some markets that have seen an increasing rise in prices,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, adding that he anticipates moderate home appreciation gains in the future.
Another potential risk is whether interest rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve begin to force consumer borrowing costs higher. The Fed has raised short-term rates by 1 percentage point in the past 18 months, but longer-term rates have so far not followed suit as inflation pressures remain subdued.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, was 4.13 percent in the latest week, down from 4.47 percent three months earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

""It will be interesting to see how robust is the housing market if we were to see mortgage rates in the 5 or 6 percent range,"" Dye said.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence increased to 118.9 this month from a reading of 117.6 (revised from an initial 117.9) in May.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 116.0 in June.
“Consumer confidence increased moderately in June following a small decline in May,” Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
Franco noted that consumers’ assessment of current conditions hit nearly a 16-year high and though short-term expectations eased somewhat, they were still upbeat.
“Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating,” she added.
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was June 15.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with the Richmond manufacturing index for the same month, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1280 from around 1.1283 ahead of the publication; GBP/USD was at 1.2763 from 1.2760 earlier; while USD/JPY was at 112.05 from 111.91 earlier.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2017 02:43AM ET</span>","China industrial profits quicken in May, seen fading as finance costs rise","BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial companies surged 16.7 percent in May from a year earlier, accelerating from 14 percent in April in spite of expectations of a slowdown as borrowing costs rise and the property market cools.
For the first five months of the year, profits reached 2.9 trillion yuan ($424 billion), up 22.7 percent from the same period of last year although the growth pace was lower than the 24.4 percent annual rate for January-April 2017.
""The quickened growth of China's industrial profits was partly due to a low-base effect at the same time a year earlier, which marked the second slowest growth over the course of last year,"" statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Operating costs as a proportion of operating revenue rose on an annual basis for a third consecutive month in May, which He said needed to be closely watched.
Profit growth at private enterprises and foreign enterprises fell to 14.0 percent and 18.9 percent respectively in the year to May, from 14.3 percent and 19.8 percent in January-April.
Nomura analysts this growth noted was driven by ""increased investment gains"" and ""net non-operating incomes"", terms often used to refer to property profits. 
""Our concerns over growth quality remain,"" they said.
Profits at China's state-owned firms enterprises (SOE) were up 53.3 percent at 652.04 billion yuan in January-May, compared with a 58.7 percent rise in the first four months.
""The low base is likely to support high profit growth of SOEs for a few more months,"" Nomura said.

""The return of PPI deflation should also lead to lower industrial profit growth,"" Nomura said. 
Concerns about China grew after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating last month. The agency said it expects Chinese financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. 
China's statistics bureau said this month that economic performance in the January-May period laid a solid foundation for achieving the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent.
China's strong growth prompted the International Monetary Fund this month to raise its 2017 growth forecast to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent.
Capital Economics, which forecast last year that China's economic rebound would run out of steam early in 2017 as policy support was withdrawn, said last week that the predicted slowdown would be ""mild"" with growth dropping back towards ""a sustainable pace"".
Still, with half a year left to go, the economy is expected to handily meet its annual growth target without hitting too many bumps, good news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year.

An index of consumer confidence produced by polling firm YouGov fell back to just above levels last seen just after last year's shock referendum decision to leave the European Union.
""Our preliminary assessment is that economic growth will fall sharply over the coming months and the country will only be saved from recession by strong international trade,"" said Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman at the Centre for Economics and Business Research which produces the index with YouGov.
Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to secure a parliamentary majority in the June 8 election, raising the prospect of a weak government, weighed on consumers who were already feeling the strain of higher inflation and weak wage growth, YouGov said.
""But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years,"" Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports, said.
YouGov's conclusions were based on data collected between June 9 and June 21. The online polling company conducts around 6,000 online surveys a month.
Britain's housing market has come under pressure in recent months. Mortgage lender Nationwide has reported three successive monthly falls in house prices for the first time since 2009, while rival Halifax says annual growth is the lowest since 2013.
Britain's economy as a whole initially withstood the shock of the Brexit vote but lost much of its momentum in early 2017.
The combination of slow growth and high inflation has put the Bank of England in a difficult spot. Its interest-rate setters split 5-3 this month on the need to raise borrowing costs to see off a rise in inflation. The BoE is waiting to see if exports can offset weaker consumer demand.

There was some more encouraging economic news on Tuesday from jobs website Adzuna. For the past two years it has reported year-on-year declines in available wages. May's decline of 1.0 percent was the joint-smallest since July 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent, the largest decline since December. 
These so-called core capital goods orders were revised up to show an increase of 0.2 percent for April. They were previously reported to have risen 0.1 percent.
""We see the core data as consistent with soft business investment in the second quarter"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist with  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The report added to growing worries that the strength of the acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter may not be as robust as expected, despite a drop in the unemployment rate to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May. 
The economy grew at a tepid 1.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. Recent data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation have been disappointing.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve left its second-quarter GDP growth forecast unchanged at a 2.9 percent annualized pace on Monday. The updated projection encompassed the durable goods data and last Friday's better-than-expected new home sales report.
In May, shipments of core capital goods fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.1 percent in April. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent in May.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries edged up after the data. U.S. stocks dipped in pre-market trading but had rebounded to trade mostly higher later in the session. The U.S. dollar (DXY) erased earlier losses to trade firmer against a basket of currencies. 
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or longer, fell 1.1 percent in May, the biggest decline since November. They dropped 0.9 percent in April.

Last month, orders for machinery rose 0.6 percent while shipments decreased 0.3 percent. Civilian aircraft orders declined 11.7 percent and bookings for defense aircraft and parts plummeted 30.8 percent. Orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 1.2 percent.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in June likely fell 2 percent from a year earlier despite large discounts for consumers, presenting a fresh sign that automakers are heading into a downturn, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.
LMC also cut its full-year 2017 forecast for new vehicle sales for the third consecutive month, to 17.1 million units from its previous forecast of 17.2 million.
June U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.48 million units, a drop of 2 percent from 1.51 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 15 selling days of the month. Automakers will release June U.S. sales results on July 3.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 16.5 million vehicles, down nearly 2 percent from 16.8 million units in the same month in 2016.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to decline more than 1.3 percent in June.
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But the market has begun to saturate thanks partly to a glut of nearly-new used vehicles, forcing automakers to hike incentives to entice consumers to buy.
Fears of a downturn were heightened earlier this month when automakers posted their third consecutive month of declining sales. Annualized sales fell to 16.66 million cars and light trucks in May from 17.17 million vehicles a year earlier. 
""As the U.S. auto market enters the fourth month in a row of a sub-17 million unit selling rate, nerves are being tested,"" Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive, said in a release. ""It will be challenging in the second half of the year to keep pace with 2016 ... but a year still expected above 17 million units should not be considered a poor performance.""
The consultancies said consumer discounts averaged $3,661 per vehicle, a record for the month. 
But the average transaction price also hit a record for the month of $31,720.
Discounts as a percentage of the manufacturer's recommended sale price remained at 10 percent in June, a level industry experts say is unsustainable.
Inventory levels at major automakers have also raised concerns. 

The average number of days a new vehicle sits on a dealer's lot before sale remained at 70 through the first 15 days of June.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence unexpectedly rose in June to a record high, as strong domestic consumption and robust exports combined to make company executives increasingly upbeat about the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 115.1 from 114.6 in May. The reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast of 114.4.
""Sentiment among German businesses is jubilant,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
""Companies were significantly more satisfied with their current business situation this month. They also expect business to improve. Germany's economy is performing very strongly.""
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said neither the prospect of Britain's departure from the European Union nor the countdown to federal elections in September had affected business morale, though the election could have an impact in August.
Private consumption was a key growth driver and there was still room for expansion in exports, he told Reuters.
Growth in the economy, Europe's largest, accelerated to 0.6 percent quarter on quarter in the first three months of 2017. Wohlrabe expected 0.7 percent in the second quarter.
Andreas Scheuerle, economist at DekaBank, said some German business executives were at risk of getting carried away.
""Even in the first quarter, business sentiment ... was much too optimistic compared to actual developments. In the second quarter, this trend was further strengthened,"" he said. ""This will correct at some point, but then we should not make the mistake of interpreting this as the way to the next recession.""
Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand.
The Bundesbank raised its growth forecasts this month.
But the government is sticking to its cautious outlook for GDP growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries told Reuters after the Bundesbank's revision.

Annual consumer lending growth slowed to 5.1 percent in May, down sharply from 6.4 percent in April and its weakest increase since October 2015, the British Bankers' Association said.
Banks approved 40,347 mortgages for house purchase last month, down from 40,686 in April and the smallest monthly number since September.
Eric Leenders, the BBA's managing director for retail banking, said the numbers suggested consumers - who were already feeling the pinch from rising inflation and slowing wage growth - turned cautious ahead of a national election on June 8.
""This month's figures show that in the run-up to the general election, credit growth in personal loans, cards and overdrafts has slowed, which was reflected in lower spending,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales rose in May and the median sales price surged to an all-time high, suggesting the housing market had regained momentum.
The Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales increased 2.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610,000 units last month. April's sales pace was also revised sharply higher to 593,000 units from 569,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up about 10 percent of all home sales, rising 5.4 percent to a pace of 597,000 units last month. Sales were up 8.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in May.
""While the data quality of the new home sales report is notoriously poor, the general picture from this report and the existing home sales report is one of solid housing demand in the important spring selling season,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist with J.P. Morgan.
The housing market has been bolstered by continued strong job growth. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May and mortgage rates are still favorable by historical standards.
However, an increase in the cost of building materials and shortages of lots and labor have crimped homebuilding. With demand outstripping supply, house prices remain elevated.
The median house price rose to a record high of $345,800 in May, from $310,200 in the prior month. The average sales price last month was $406,400, also a record high.
The U.S. dollar pared losses against the yen after the data. U.S. stocks were trading modestly higher while prices of U.S. Treasuries edged up.
Across the nation's four regions, new home sales were mixed. They fell 25.7 percent in the Midwest and 10.8 percent in the Northeast, but rose 13.3 percent in the West and 6.2 percent in the South, which accounts for a large share of the housing market.
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 268,000 units last month.

At May's sales rate, it would take 5.3 months to clear inventory, unchanged from April. A six-month supply is seen as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Analysts had expected the reading to recover to 53.7.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.1 in June from the prior month’s final reading of 52.7. That was a nine-month low.
Analysts had expected a slight increase to 53.0.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The composite PMI, including activity in both sectors, fell to 53.0 in June from the previous month’s reading of 53.6.
Still, the report indicated that new orders left some room to be optimistic over the future as new orders rose at the strongest pace in five months.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said warned that though growth would likely be higher than in the first quarter, “the relatively subdued PMI readings suggest there are some downside risks to the extent to which GDP will rebound.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Roaring euro zone business growth tailed off unexpectedly toward the end of the first half of 2017 following a sudden slowing in the pace of expansion by services firms, a survey showed on Friday.
But with inflation relatively resilient and overall growth still quite strong, pressure will likely be maintained on policymakers at the European Central Bank to pare back soon on their ultra-loose monetary policy.
Earlier this month, the ECB gave up its bias for more rate cuts in a small step towards normalization.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for June fell to 55.7 from the 56.8 it registered in April and May, which was its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
A Reuters poll had predicted no change to the index, seen as a good guide to growth, and none of the economists polled had predicted such a big fall.
""At the moment I'm not too worried about it,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""We may be reaching the stage where growth has been strong for quite a few months and we are hitting a few ceilings in terms of degrees to which firms can expand capacity."" 
Williamson said the PMI pointed to second quarter GDP growth of 0.7 percent, faster than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month. The PMIs had correctly indicated a 0.6 percent expansion last quarter. 
Economic data points to solid growth in the euro zone in the second quarter and inflation will hover near current levels in coming months, the ECB said in a regular economic bulletin on Thursday.
As they have done for the previous seven months, firms increased prices in June, albeit at a weaker pace as input cost pressures eased. The output prices index dipped to 51.8 from 52.4.
Firms operating in the bloc's dominant service industry did not perform as expected. The services PMI fell to 54.7 from 56.3, well below even the most pessimistic forecaster in a Reuters poll of over 40 economists.
""It's not really clear what that's about, there was no single cause we can pinpoint and I'm inclined to treat it just as some payback for the sheer strength of growth in recent months,"" Williamson said.
In one bright spot, the employment index held at May's 53.8. It has only been higher than that once since early 2008, in March of this year.
Factories had a better month than predicted. The manufacturing PMI climbed to a more than six-year high of 57.3 from 57.0. The Reuters poll suggested it would dip to 56.8.
An index measuring output nudged up to 58.5 from 58.3, its highest since April 2011.

Implying the momentum would continue into July, new orders surged and factories ran down stocks of finished goods at the fastest rate for nine months. The related subindex sank to 47.9 from 49.1.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors decreased to 55.7 in June, from the prior month’s reading of 56.8 and below forecasts a drop to 56.6.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index also declined more than expected to 54.7 this month, from the prior 56.3.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to only 56.2.
However, the preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.3 this month from a final reading of 57.0 in May. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 56.8 in June.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“Although the rate of growth waned to a five-month low, high order book inflows and elevated levels of business confidence meant job creation remained one of the strongest recorded over the past decade as firms continued to expand capacity to meet rising demand,” IHS Markit said.
The quarterly read was the strongest quarterly expansion in over six years, according to the report
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson indicated that the survey data was consistent with growth in the euro zone accelerating to 0.7% in the second quarter from the prior reading of 0.6%.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1185 compared to 1.1173 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8782 from 0.8776 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading lower. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.42%, Germany's DAX decreased 0.25%, France’s CAC 40 traded down 0.36%, while London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.45%."

553,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",BOJ June Tankan set to show improved business confidence; CPI seen rising,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' confidence is expected to have improved for a third straight quarter in June to match the peak seen two years ago, but may recede in the coming quarter on uncertainty around conditions overseas.
A Reuters poll of 16 economists found the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rising 3 points to plus 15 in June from three months ago. 
That would be the third straight quarterly rises, matching the level seen in the June 2015 survey and highest since March 2014 when the index stood at plus 17.
""We expect big manufacturers' mood is recovering due to a favorable export environment, stable currency and factory output recovering on a pickup in consumer spending,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
""As for the outlook, in addition to uncertainty over the Trump administration, geopolitical issues such as Brexit and the North Korea situation will weigh on business sentiment.""
The poll found the big non-manufacturers' sentiment index would rise 3 points to plus 23 in June, which would be the highest level since December 2015 when the index was at plus 25. 
Business confidence among big manufacturers was seen likely worsen slightly to plus 14 in the coming quarter, while non-manufacturers' morale is seen deteriorating to plus 20, the poll found.
The survey found that big firms will plan to raise their capital spending in this fiscal year by 7.4 percent, upgrading from 0.6 percent in the March survey. 
The BOJ will announce the outcome of its quarterly tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. on July 3 (2350 GMT on July 2).
The Reuters monthly Tankan, which tracks the BOJ's survey, showed confidence among Japanese manufacturers bounced in June to match a decade-high level recorded in April and is expected to rise for several months, providing more evidence of economic recovery.
The poll also found the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was expected to rise 0.4 percent in May, up for a fifth straight month, driven by energy costs.
Factory output was thought likely to fall 3.2 percent in May from the previous month, but analysts believe that such a drop would be in reaction to a 4.0 percent gain in April.
Retail sales were forecast to rise an annual 2.6 percent in May, up for a seventh straight month. The poll showed household spending likely slipped 0.6 percent from a year earlier, down for 15 straight months, although the rate of decline slowed from a 1.4 percent drop in April.
""Consumer spending on durable goods such as autos and electrical appliances is on the rise but wage recovery remains sluggish, so the pace of recovery in consumer spending will stay slow,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen steady at 1.48 in May, staying at the highest level since February 1974 when the ratio was at 1.53. And the unemployment rate likely stood at 2.8 percent for the month, unchanged form the previous month.
The internal affairs ministry will release core CPI, household spending and jobs-related data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday (23:30 GMT on Thursday).
The trade ministry will announce retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday and industrial production on Friday.
Japan's government on Thursday raised its overall view of the economy for the first time in six months, reflecting a gradual pick-up in private consumption and underscoring its confidence that an export-led recovery is broadening.

Real wages climbed by 0.6 percent between January and March compared with the same period last year - their slowest rise since the end of 2013.
Earnings rose by 2.6 percent, a stronger rate than in the previous three quarters, but inflation picked up to 1.9 percent, reaching its highest level since the end of 2012, partly due to the higher cost of petrol and heating oil.

Rising wages, record high employment and ultra-low borrowing costs have helped make consumption a key pillar of growth in Germany, which has traditionally been an export-driven economy.

The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 in June from a final 53.1 in May.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 10th consecutive month.
""Slower growth was signaled in June, with both orders and output rising at the weakest rates since late last year amid reports of a slight softening in market conditions,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, external demand is holding up well, and the sector continues to operate within a solid growth range.""
The index for new orders, which includes both domestic and overseas orders, fell to a preliminary 51.3 from a final 53.4 in May to reach the lowest level since November.
The flash index for new export orders fell to 52.5 in June from 53.0 in the previous month.
The drop in the flash PMI index is unlikely to dent growing optimism about Japan's economy.

In recent months, the Bank of Japan has upgraded its overall economic assessment and its view of consumption as rising exports, strong factory output and a tightening labor market support growth.

Companies signed up for $7.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit in May, according to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA).
""Although certain verticals and industry sectors are performing better than others, overall demand for capital equipment continues the positive momentum begun in the first few months of the year,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Washington-based ELFA, a trade body that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 77 percent in May, up from 75.9 percent in April.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or subsidiaries of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

Inflation for the year through mid-June was 6.30 percent , the national statistics agency said on Thursday, above forecasts in a Reuters poll for 6.25 percent. 
That was higher than the 6.16 percent rate seen in the second-half of May and the highest since January 2009.
Mexico's central bank is expected to raise interest rates later on Thursday to contain the spike in inflation and following the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to increase borrowing costs.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended June 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless claims rising to 240,000 in the latest week.
Following the report, the dollar held at slightly lower levels against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries were little changed.
Jobless claims for the prior week were revised upwards by 1,000 to 238,000 from 237,000. The week's tally is the 120th consecutive week that claims have been below 300,000, the threshold associated with a strong labor market. It's the longest stretch that claims have remained below that level since 1970.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smoothes week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 244,750 last week, the highest since early April.
Many economists consider the labor market to be at or near full employment. The unemployment rate in May declined to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week for the second time in three months and signaled it remains on track for one more rate hike this year.
Fed officials have been buoyed by the tightening jobs market although it has yet to translate into significant pricing pressures.
Indeed, some policymakers at the central bank have begun to show increasing concern that a recent pullback in inflation may point to sustained difficulty in returning it to the Fed's 2 percent target.
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data. Only claims for Louisiana were estimated.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 8,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended June 10.

The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 10 straight weeks, indicating diminishing labor market slack.

The four-week moving average was 244,750, up 1,500 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Export order growth was its strongest in 22 years, the CBI said, helped by the fall in the pound that was triggered by last year's Brexit vote.
The strong performance by manufacturers will be noted by the BoE, where three members of the eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee last week voted to raise rates, citing among other factors a pick-up in exports and investment which could help to offset a squeeze in spending for domestic consumers.

On Wednesday, the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to vote for a rate hike too later this year, as long as the economic data justified it.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.62 million units last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales declining 0.5 percent to a rate of 5.55 million units. Sales were up 2.7 percent from May 2016.
The number of homes on the market rose 2.1 percent, but supply was down 8.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 24 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
The median house price increased to an all-time high of $252,800, a 5.8 percent jump from one year ago, reflecting the dearth of properties on the market.
""We have a housing shortage, we may even use the term housing crisis in some markets,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. 
House price gains have also been helped by an unemployment rate that is at a 16-year low. Mortgage rates also remain favorable by historical standards.
At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.7 months one year ago. The median number of days homes were on the market in May was 27, the shortest time frame since NAR began tracking data in 2011.

Despite robust demand for housing, the sector has shown some recent signs of strain. U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to its lowest level in eight months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported last week.

The industry data showed that home resales increased by 1.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted 5.62 million units from 5.56 million units in the previous month. April’s data was revised down from an initial reading of 5.57 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.5% drop from April’s initial reading to 5.55 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
The report indicated that the sales pace was 2.7% above a year ago and the third highest over the past year.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that homes are coming off the market at an extremely fast pace and that listings in an affordable price range are scarce.
According to the report, the median existing-home price in May was $252,800, up 5.8% from May 2016 ($238,900).
“Home prices keep chugging along at a pace that is not sustainable in the long run,” Yun added Yun.
“Current demand levels indicate sales should be stronger, but it's clear some would-be buyers are having to delay or postpone their home search because low supply is leading to worsening affordability conditions,” he explained.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Business confidence in Asia rose to a three-year-high in the second quarter of the year, propelled by a slew of favorable economic data across the region and easing concerns over the health of China's economy, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> , representing the six-month outlook of 101 firms, climbed to 74 in April-June from 70 three months earlier. A reading over 50 indicates a positive view.
""The world economy is starting to look more solid,"" said Singapore-based economics professor Antonio Fatas at global business school INSEAD.

""The U.S. is reaching good levels of GDP and employment, with Europe finally recovering and Asia seeing less risks ahead. China looks like it's in a more stable situation after having ups and downs because of capital outflows over the last couple of years and also the risks of a debt crisis.""
China is widely expected to meet its 6.5 percent economic growth target this year without too many bumps, helped by a pick-up in exports and stable growth in factory output and retail sales. The government has also sought to reduce debt.
Reflecting the upbeat picture, the country upon which much of Asia depends for trade scored a business sentiment subindex of 75, up from 72 three months prior.
In nearby Japan, sentiment hit its highest-ever with a subindex of 83 compared with 61 in the previous quarter and an average of 58 in the survey's eight-year life. The country's central bank in April offered its most optimistic assessment of the economy in nine years, saying it was turning toward expansion.
Buoyant consumer confidence and export growth that exceeded initial estimates helped Indonesia's sentiment subindex rise 8 points to 83, its highest in over a year.
Sentiment rebounded the most in South Korea with a 50-point jump in its subindex to 75. The result came after the country's new president vowed to review a decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system which had angered China and prompted a boycott of Korean goods.
""The cloud of political risk has disappeared,"" Fatas said. ""Last quarter the data for South Korea was looking weaker. There was potential for crisis with some trading partners, in particular China.""
Sentiment also edged up in India and Thailand, but weakened in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines. Singapore posted the lowest subindex of 62 - but even that was the strongest lowest subindex the survey has seen since it began in 2009.
CONSTRUCTION BULLISH
Thomson Reuters and INSEAD polled companies from June 2 to 16. Of the 101 respondents, 56 percent rated their six-month outlook as positive, the highest proportion in over six years. 37 percent were neutral and 7 percent were negative.
Respondents included Australia's APA Group (AX:APA), Japan's Hitachi Ltd (T:6501), South Korea's Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270), India's Vedanta Ltd (NS:VDAN) and China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600115).
The most bullish respondents were from the construction and engineering as well as transport and logistics industries, with half of such firms saying business volume had grown over the past three months. 
The two sectors are set to benefit from China's pledge in May to lend about $56 billion for infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe and Africa as part of its Belt and Road initiative.
The metals and chemicals industry registered the biggest jump in sentiment, by 41 points to 81, while confidence was also buoyant among firms in the healthcare, financial and retail sectors.
""E-commerce in Southeast Asia has significant potential for growth for years to come,"" said Magnus Ekbom, group chief strategy officer at survey respondent Lazada Group SA, an online retailer backed by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
""We are on track to achieving our goal of making 100 million products available across all of our 6 markets.""
The real estate sector and the household, food and beverage sector tied for the lowest subindex, while sentiment in the technology and telecommunications industry fell 7 points to 67.
Survey respondent Intouch Holdings PCL (BK:INTUCH), a Thai telecoms firm, said it was anticipating positive impact in the second-half of the year from the mobile and fixed broadband business.
""Overall, mobile competition still remains due to continued handset campaign offerings,"" the firm said in an email to Reuters. ""However, we see an opportunity from an uplift in data consumption from customer's behavioral changes."" 
Firms ranked disruptive technologies as the chief risk to their six-month outlooks. Disruptive technologies include the sharing platforms of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Airbnb Inc which are increasingly taking market share from traditional industry leaders.
Other risks cited include an inconsistent U.S. administration and protectionism. The U.S. president has pledged to pursue policies widely described as protectionist, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, expanded by 2.4 percent to $116.8 billion.
The current account deficit for the fourth quarter was revised up to $114.0 billion from the previously reported $112.4 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit rising to $123.8 billion in the first quarter.
The first-quarter current account deficit represented 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, up from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
The current account deficit has dropped from a record high of 6.3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as rising domestic oil production and lower global oil prices curbed the import bill.
The deficit on goods widened by $5.3 billion to $200.3 billion in the first quarter. Imports of goods rose 3.3 percent

The surplus on primary income - which includes investment income such as dividends, and employee compensation - fell by $3.6 billion. Primary income receipts increased $3.5 billion to $216.5 billion.
The deficit on secondary income, U.S. government grants, pensions, fines and penalties, and worker remittances fell to $25.5 billion from $31.3 billion in the fourth quarter.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's May export orders blew past expectations as the island's factories rushed to meet demand for components, such as for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's upcoming iPhone 8, in a promising sign for global technology manufacturers. 
The trade-dependent economy has expanded for four quarters underpinned by rebounding exports. Even though momentum may cool in the second half, global demand for Taiwan's tech goods will bolster the economy and likely give the central bank leeway to keep interest rates on hold this week.
""All major products showed year-on-year growth,"" the finance ministry said in a statement. ""Order value from the U.S. market hit $10.36 billion, a record level for the month of May."" 
May orders rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, beating the 6.85 percent forecast in a Reuters poll and compared with a 7.4 percent expansion in April.
The ministry said that June export order value would be higher than May.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
Orders from China and the United States - its two biggest markets - rose an annual 14.5 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively. In April, they climbed 13.8 percent and 6 percent.
Europe orders jumped 15.3 percent and from Japan, they surged 19.2 percent. 
Taiwan raised its 2017 economic growth forecast to a three-year high in May, thanks to strong global demand for smartphones and other hi-tech electronic gadgets.

Exports in May expanded for the eighth straight month as factories churned out supplies for Apple's new iPhone.

The data showed the deficit at 462 million euros ($515.45 million) from 872 million euros in April 2016. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 484 million euros from 434 million in the same month a year earlier.
""A year-on-year drop of 196 million euros in the deficit of the balance of goods is attributable to a decrease mostly in the deficit of the oil balance and to a lesser extent of the non-oil balance of goods,"" the Bank of Greece said.
Non-oil exports of goods at current prices remained virtually flat, while they declined by 2.6 percent at constant prices, it said.
The 176 million euro rise in the primary income account surplus was mainly due to higher net interest, dividend and profit receipts.
In 2016 as a whole, Greece posted a current account deficit of 1.1 billion euros versus a surplus of 206 million in 2015 as a result of a lower services balance surplus.

Members commenced their discussion of international economic developments by noting that global economic conditions had continued to improve in 2017, although headline inflation had eased a little in most economies and core inflation remained low.
Survey measures of business conditions in both the manufacturing and services sectors had improved since mid 2016 in a range of countries, and global consumer confidence had increased markedly to a high level. Members noted that global consumption growth had remained steady at a solid rate and had underpinned growth in the world economy over recent years.
The improvement in global economic conditions had been evident in stronger growth in both merchandise trade and industrial production. Data on new export orders suggested continued strong growth in exports in the near term. Members observed that there had been some signs that this strength was flowing through to business investment, particularly in Japan and the high-income economies in east Asia. Business investment had also picked up recently in the United States. Members also noted that a more broadly based strengthening in business investment would assist in generating a self-sustaining positive dynamic in the world economy.
In China, growth in private fixed asset investment had been slowing for some time from very high rates. This reflected structural factors, as growth rebalanced in line with the maturing of the Chinese economy, as well as cyclical factors more recently. Members noted that dwelling investment had picked up over the preceding year or so, partly in response to an easing in housing policies in 2015. The recovery in residential construction had continued despite the Chinese authorities having again tightened policy measures aimed at reducing speculative activity in a number of cities to contain rapid housing price growth.
Spending on property construction, as well as infrastructure investment, in China had supported the demand for steel and, in turn, Chinese imports of iron ore and coal. This strength in demand had been reflected in Chinese steel prices, but iron ore prices had declined, as expected, largely reflecting increases in supply. Coal prices had also declined recently, as supply disruptions associated with Cyclone Debbie had been resolved.
Globally, headline inflation had picked up over the preceding year, largely reflecting higher oil prices. However, members noted that this inflationary impulse had started to dissipate as oil prices had fallen since the start of the year. Core inflation had generally remained low.
Unemployment rates in many major advanced economies had been around or below levels that could be associated with a build-up in wage pressures. Wage growth had been increasing gradually in the United States and Japan, but an increase had not been as apparent in most European countries. Taking into account the low rate of productivity growth generally, growth in unit labour costs had been above average in the United States, Japan and Germany.
Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the March quarter national accounts, which were scheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, were likely to show that GDP growth had moderated following the strong December quarter outcome. Partial indicators had suggested that slower growth in consumption and falls in residential investment and resource exports were likely to be recorded in the accounts. However, nominal output growth was expected to have been supported by the strength in the terms of trade during the quarter.
Weak growth in retail sales in the March quarter had pointed to a slowing in consumption growth following strong growth in the December quarter. According to liaison and survey data, retail trading conditions had remained challenging, although they had appeared to have improved a little since the start of the year, and this assessment had been supported by the large rise in retail sales in April. Low household income growth and concerns about increased indebtedness had continued to pose downside risks to the outlook for consumption growth.
The labour market was an important factor in the outlook for household income growth. Employment growth had picked up over 2017 and forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggested that the recent pace of employment growth was likely to continue. However, growth had continued to be disproportionate, with part-time jobs and total hours worked having fallen in prior months. Members observed that, although the unemployment rate had fallen to5.7 per cent in April, the number of employed people who would like to work more hours had not declined.
Members noted the divergence in labour market developments across the states, although the degree to which this was consistent with other indicators of economic conditions across the states varied. In particular, the steady growth in hours worked in Victoria, in line with the state's strong economic growth, was in contrast to the fall in hours worked over the previous year or so in New South Wales, which had also posted relatively strong economic growth. The pick-up in hours worked in Western Australia and, more recently, Queensland suggested that the drag from the adjustment to the downturn in mining investment in those states might be running or have run its course.
Members also discussed conditions in the youth labour market, which historically has been very sensitive to changes in labour market conditions more generally. In particular, members noted that the proportion of 15–19 year olds not in education, training or employment had been declining over recent years, while the proportion of 20–24 year olds not in education, training or employment had been increasing.
The wage price index had increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, suggesting that aggregate wage growth had stabilised at low levels. Wage growth had remained particularly low in the mining sector. Liaison suggested that, while wage growth is likely to remain subdued for some time yet, there had been isolated reports of localised and skills-specific labour shortages feeding into higher wages.
Work done on residential construction had posted an unexpected fall in the March quarter. Members noted that this was partly explained by wet weather in some states during this period, suggesting some recovery could be expected in the June quarter. In contrast, there had been further falls in construction in Western Australia, which was consistent with the persistently weak conditions in that state's construction sector. The outstanding pipeline of work had remained high in most other states and was expected to support residential building activity over the forecast period. However, building approvals had fallen across most states since late 2016, particularly for higher-density dwellings, and the pipeline of work to be done was likely to decline over the forecast period.
Conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary across the country. Conditions remained strong in Sydney and Melbourne, although there had been some tentative signs of easing; housing price growth and auction clearance rates in both cities had declined. In contrast, housing market conditions had been weaker elsewhere for some time, particularly in Perth and in the Brisbane apartment market, where housing prices had been declining.
Housing credit growth overall had been relatively steady in recent months. Some slowing in the growth of credit to investors in housing had been apparent, which was consistent with the reduction in loan approvals to investors. This had been associated with the increases in interest rates on these loans and in interest-only loans more broadly. Members noted that it would take some time for the full effects of the latest prudential supervision measures introduced by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) to flow through to the housing lending data.
The ABS survey of capital expenditure suggested that mining investment had increased slightly in the March quarter, in contrast to the forecast by the Bank of a further decline at the time of the May Statement on Monetary Policy. In line with the Bank's forecasts, however, the capital expenditure survey continued to suggest further falls in investment in the mining sector over the coming year or so, but at a declining rate. Growth in non-mining investment was also expected to have increased in the March quarter, mainly due to an increase in non-residential construction.
The capital expenditure survey continued to imply subdued growth in non-mining investment for the next year or so. However, members noted that this survey covers only around half of non-mining investment and excludes investment in areas such as health and education, and in intangible assets, such as software, for which investment growth had been strongest in recent years. Furthermore, monthly building approvals for non-residential construction had picked up a little in recent months and reports from liaison had identified a range of commercial property projects that are under consideration for the year ahead. Members also noted that survey measures of business conditions had risen further, to be around their levels before the financial crisis. However, surveys suggested that conditions in the retail sector remained difficult, despite a recent improvement, consistent with reports of heightened competition in that sector.
The Australian Government Budget had reported little change to the expected cash deficits over the next few years and, as a result, had had little effect on the Bank's near-term outlook for the Australian economy. Some new large infrastructure projects had been announced as a part of the Budget, but most of that spending would occur after 2019.
Members observed that financial markets had remained relatively quiet over prior months and political developments had continued to be a key focus of market participants over the preceding month. Financial conditions had generally remained very accommodative, with the exception of China, where the authorities had acted to reduce leverage in the financial system.
Long-term government bond yields in the United States had declined a little over the preceding month, to be at the lower end of the range experienced since the US election, as uncertainty remained about the near-term implementation of the administration's policy agenda. Long-term bond yields in other major markets had been little changed over the preceding month. In Australia, yields on long-term government bonds had declined a little over the preceding month and the spread to US Treasury bond yields had remained at low levels.
Members noted that estimates of the term premium in the United States had been at historically low levels for most of the preceding six years, including some negative estimates at times. The low level of the term premium implied that market participants were generally not concerned about the prospect of a sharp rise in either inflation or real interest rates, and/or that compensation for these risks was low for other reasons, including possibly the lack of suitable alternatives for a number of market participants to investing in long-term US government securities.
The major central banks had left policy settings and the nature of their policy guidance largely unchanged since the previous meeting. The minutes of the previous US Federal Open Market Committee meeting had highlighted that the Federal Reserve was likely to begin shrinking its balance sheet gradually later in 2017. The European Central Bank had earlier slowed its rate of asset purchases and was expected to reduce it further in 2018. The Bank of Japan was expected to continue with its asset purchase program.
In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been little changed on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month and was around its level immediately before the US election. The euro had appreciated a little further since the previous meeting, in response to an easing of political risks following election outcomes and generally positive economic developments. The Australian dollar had depreciated a little over the preceding month on a trade-weighted basis, consistent with the decline in commodity prices.
After several years of depreciation in the renminbi against the US dollar and net private capital outflows from China, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar had stabilised since the end of 2016, although it had appreciated a little very recently. At the same time, net capital outflows had declined markedly as the authorities had increased their scrutiny over capital flows. Members noted that the People's Bank of China had recently adjusted the daily fixing mechanism for the exchange rate.
Members noted that global financing conditions had remained generally favourable, with corporate bond yields having declined in most major economies and emerging markets, as well as in Australia, over the preceding month.
In contrast to developments elsewhere, in China sovereign and corporate bond yields had risen further in response to measures aimed at reducing leverage in the financial system and improving the transparency of investment products. One consequence of these actions had been reduced demand for corporate bonds and hence issuance of these bonds had declined noticeably. Members observed that household credit growth in China had continued to rise.
Major share markets had been increasing over 2017 to date, but banks' share prices had generally declined over prior months. In the United States, these falls had reflected the market's changing expectations about implementation of the US administration's policy agenda and, in Japan, bank share prices had declined following lower-than-expected corporate earnings.
Australian share prices had declined over the preceding month, to return to around their levels at the end of 2016. The decline had been driven by a sizeable fall in bank share prices. Members noted that some part of this reflected the fall in bank share prices in global markets, but that there had also been a range of domestic factors contributing to the fall, including somewhat mixed bank profit results relative to expectations and the announcement of a major bank levy in the Australian Government Budget. In the days following Standard & Poor's announcement lowering the ratings of a number of smaller Australian financial institutions, equity prices of these institutions generally fell relative to those that had not been downgraded. Members noted that the magnitude of the major bank levy was not particularly large compared with typical market movements in bank funding costs. They also noted that there was likely to be some effect of the rating downgrade on the cost of wholesale funding for smaller financial institutions, but these institutions accessed less wholesale funding than the major banks. More broadly, bank funding costs were estimated to have declined a little further in recent months.
Financial market pricing continued to indicate an expectation that the cash rate would remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017.
Members discussed how financial stability considerations bear on monetary policy decisions, reviewing both the academic literature and policy experience in a number of countries, including Sweden and the United States.
The Bank has responsibility for promoting financial stability within its flexible medium-term inflation targeting framework. Over recent times, with interest rates at low levels, the Board has set monetary policy to support the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom, while also paying close attention to trends in household borrowing and related financial stability considerations. Members discussed the effect of monetary policy decisions on financial stability and on future inflation, employment and output. They also discussed the role that prudential supervision can play in promoting financial stability. In view of this, members acknowledged the importance of a strong relationship between the Bank and other regulators, particularly APRA. They observed that the current positive culture of cooperation across the relevant agencies in Australia has been of considerable value to good policy outcomes in recent years and it is therefore important that it be maintained. The strong relationship among regulators is facilitated by the Council of Financial Regulators, which is the coordinating body for the main financial regulatory agencies to promote the stability of the Australian financial system, as well as contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of financial regulation.
Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that the broad-based pick-up in the world economy was continuing. Labour markets had tightened further in many countries and this was expected to lead to a pick-up in wages and prices over time. Headline inflation rates in most countries had moved higher over the past year, partly reflecting higher commodity prices. Nonetheless, core inflation had remained low.
Domestically, members' assessment was that the transition to lower levels of mining investment following the mining investment boom was almost complete. Surveyed business conditions had improved and business investment had picked up in those parts of the economy not directly affected by the decline in mining investment. Although year-ended GDP growth was expected to have slowed in the March quarter, reflecting the quarter-to-quarter variation in the figures, members noted that economic growth was still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent per annum.
Members noted that, although employment growth had been stronger in recent months, growth in total hours worked had declined. Nevertheless, the various forward-looking indicators pointed to continued growth in employment over the period ahead and a gradual erosion of the spare capacity in the labour market. Wage growth had remained low and this was likely to remain the case for some time yet. However, wage growth and inflation were expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened. Members observed that low growth in incomes, along with high levels of household debt, appeared to have been restraining growth in household consumption.
The economic outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Conditions in the housing market had continued to vary considerably around the country. Housing prices had been rising briskly in some markets, although there had been some signs that price pressures were starting to ease. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Growth in housing debt had outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. APRA's recent prudential supervision measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness. In response to those measures, increases in mortgage rates, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, had been announced, but were yet to have their full effect.
The Board continued to judge that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted careful monitoring. Taking into account all the available information, including that year-ended growth in output was expected to have slowed in the March quarter, the Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","Japan business mood up, points to better BOJ tankan - Reuters Tankan","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers bounced in June to match a decade-high level recorded in April and is expected to rise for several months, a Reuters survey found, providing more evidence of economic recovery.
Service-sector mood rose to a two-year high, evidence of broadening confidence, although the Reuters Tankan also found that confidence was seen slipping over the next three months. 
The readings in the Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - suggested a slight improvement in the central bank's survey due July 3, which would support the BOJ's upbeat economic outlook.
The central bank kept monetary policy steady on Friday and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months, signaling its confidence in an export-driven economic recovery that is gaining momentum.
In the poll of 526 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between June 2-15 in which 250 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 26 from 24 in May, led by materials firms such as oil refinery/ceramics and textiles/paper.
The index matched April's reading, which was the highest since August 2007, shortly before the global financial crisis. The index was up by one point from three months ago, and it was seen rising further to 29 in September.
""Machine tool makers, who are our main clients, are performing well for both external and domestic markets. The situation is good because currencies remain stable,"" a manager of a nonferrous metal firm wrote in the survey.
A recent run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market.
The Reuters Tankan service-sector index rose to 33 from 30 in May, led by gains in real estate/construction firms and wholesalers. It was seen slipping to 28 in September. Compared with three months ago, the sentiment index was up seven points.
The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

The BOJ's last tankan on April 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high, and service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices levelled off in China's biggest cities in May but continued to climb nationwide, indicating demand remains resilient despite a series of government measures to keep the market from overheating.
Firm price gains highlight the challenge Chinese authorities face in calming a frothy market without disrupting the economy, in which real estate is a major driver of growth. 
Economists say the pace of price growth across different market tiers clearly shows a passing of the baton from the centre to the regions. They also fret over still-rising prices against an already high base, saying upward price pressure remains.
""While a moderation in price growth in first- and second-tier cities shows the curbs had some effects, we must note that prices are still rising with new unit prices at record high levels,"" said Sam Xie, head of research at property services provider CBRE China. 
""We expect more cities to impose curbs in the future.""
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.7 percent in May from the previous month, in line with April and remaining the quickest gain since October, Reuters calculated from an official survey out on Monday.
Compared with a year ago, new home prices rose 10.4 percent in May, easing from a 10.7 percent gain in April, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data.
Policymakers have prioritised stabilising an overheated market ahead of a Communist Party reshuffle later this year, reiterating the need to avoid dramatic price volatility that could threaten the financial system and harm social stability. 
The housing bureau in Guangdong province's Qingyuan city said last week prices for pre-sold new units must be sold at no more than 5 percent higher or no more than 15 percent lower than in similar projects in the area in the past month, effectively setting a price cap and floor to stabilise the market. 
The NBS said price growth for new homes in China's 15 most overheated cities - mainly provincial capitals with the most stringent curbs - has remained ""basically stable"" from the previous month as city-based control measures continued to take effect.
Prices for new homes in China's biggest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai stopped climbing in May on a monthly basis, while prices fell 0.6 percent in Shenzhen, the fastest seen in three months. 
Compared to a year ago, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen prices still grew 13.5 percent, 11 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively. 
The actions of authorities, who also stressed the need to actively push for inventory destocking in smaller cities experiencing a housing glut, have spread investor activity more broadly rather than halting it outright. 
Investors, banned from the hottest markets, are increasingly looking inland, driving up prices in more remote, smaller cities with fewer buying restrictions, leading to a surprise pick-up in May sales. 
For example, Bengbu, a mid-sized city in central China's Anhui province, topped the list in May, with prices of new units rising 3.4 percent on-month, compared to a 2.2 percent gain in April. 
Price growth in smaller third-tier cities rose to 0.9 percent in May from April's 0.8 percent, CBRE's Xie said. The Statistics Bureau does not release price index data by market tiers.
Central bank data published last Wednesday showed Chinese banks extended more credit than expected in May, with home loans expanding even as policymakers struggled to rein in riskier borrowing without impeding economic growth.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 610.6 billion yuan in May from 571 billion yuan in April, accounting for 55 percent of total new loans last month, up from 52 percent in April, the data showed.
But analysts say new tightening measures introduced since mid-March have started taking some heat out of the market, and property investment is likely to have peaked following a sharp drop in sales because of such curbs.

Indeed, annual growth in China's real estate investment slowed in May, the first fall-off in three months, taking a toll on new developments. New construction starts almost halved from the previous month, official data showed last Wednesday.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2017 09:47PM ET</span>","Japan's May exports rise at fastest in two years, set to sustain growth","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports surged in May by the fastest in more than two years on bigger shipments of cars and steel, an encouraging sign that robust overseas demand will support economic growth.
The 14.9 percent annual increase in exports in May was below the median estimate for a 16.1 percent annual increase but was nonetheless the biggest rise since January 2015.
Exports are likely to continue rising at a steady clip as overseas economies show increasing signs of strength, which should help Japan's economy extend its recent run of solid expansion.
""The main scenario is Japan's exports will continue to recover,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""However, the pace of growth could slow somewhat as inventories of certain goods, like electronics, start to build up overseas.""
Exports of cars and car parts rose partly because an earthquake in Kumamoto last year in May temporarily shut down production of these goods, Tonouchi noted. 
Japan's exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since July 2015, due to an increase of shipments of autos and auto parts.
Exports to China increased 23.9 percent year-on-year in May, following a 14.8 percent annual increase in April. Larger shipments of flat panels and semiconductor manufacturing equipment drove the gains in China-bound exports.
Exports to Asia, which includes China, rose 16.8 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase in three months, due to increased shipments of electronics to Hong Kong and steel to Indonesia, the data showed.
In terms of volume, Japan's exports rose 7.5 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest gain in three months, another indication that overseas demand is firm.
Japan's imports rose 17.8 percent in the year to May, versus the median estimate for a 14.8 percent annual increase, as a rise in the price of oil from a year ago pushed up the value of imports.
The trade balance came to a deficit of 203.4 billion yen ($1.83 billion), versus the median estimate for a 76.0 billion yen surplus.

Policymakers and economists have become more optimistic about Japan's prospects this year as an increase in factory output and a tightening labor market show the economy is poised to extend its recent growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to the lowest level in eight months as construction activity declined broadly, suggesting that housing could be a drag on economic growth in the second quarter.
Housing starts weakened despite a dearth of properties on the market, which is hurting sales and boosting prices. Economists blame shortages of labor and land for the downturn. Demand for housing remains strong, underpinned by a tightening labor market.
""The recent stall in homebuilding is bad news for growth,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""A shortage of construction workers may be weighing on the construction industry, and in some parts of the country short supply of land to build on is also a factor.""
Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a rise to a 1.22 million-unit pace. 
Homebuilding fell 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. Building permits last month fell 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.17 million units, the lowest level since April 2016. 
The housing data added to weak reports on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation in tempering expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. Another report on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment in early June.
Housing has contributed to gross domestic product for two straight quarters. The Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its estimate for second-quarter GDP to a 2.9 percent annualized rate from a 3.2 percent pace. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter.
U.S. government bond prices were trading higher, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The PHLX housing index (HGX) dropped 0.23 percent, with shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), declining 1.12 percent. 
U.S. stocks fell as shares of Wal-Mart (N:WMT) and other retailers were hammered after Amazon.com (O:AMZN) announced its entry into the brick-and-mortar retail business with its $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods (O:WFM).
BROAD WEAKNESS
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, decreased 3.9 percent to a 794,000 unit-pace last month, also the lowest level in eight months. Single-family home construction has lost momentum since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February.
Single-family building permits fell 1.9 percent to a 779,000 unit-rate. The third straight monthly decline in permits left them below the housing starts level, suggesting single-family homebuilding may remain weak in the coming months.
Economists blame the moderation on supply constraints rather than demand for housing, which remains underpinned by a strong labor market. With the unemployment rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, workers' wages are gradually rising. 
While mortgage rates have risen, they remain low by historical standards. A survey on Thursday showed a dip in homebuilder confidence in June, with homebuilders expressing frustration over ongoing shortages of skilled labor and building lots. 
""Ongoing job growth, rising demand and low mortgage rates should keep the single-family sector moving forward this year, even as builders deal with ongoing shortages of lots and labor,"" said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.
In May, single-family starts surged in the Northeast and Midwest, but tumbled in the South and West. House completions rose 5.6 percent to a 1.16 million-unit rate, still below the 1.5 million to 1.6 million units range that realtors say is needed to address the chronic housing shortage.
There were 1.93 million previously owned houses on the market in April. The demand and supply gap could keep house prices elevated. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment also fell in May, declining 9.7 percent to a rate of 298,000 units. It was the fifth straight monthly decline. 

With rental increases appearing to have leveled off after strong gains in the last few years, there is likely limited room for strong growth in the construction of multi-family homes. Multi-family permits plunged 10.4 percent to a pace of 389,000 units in May.

Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest level since September 2016.
April's sales pace was revised down to 1.16 million units from the previously reported 1.17 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.22 million units last month.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment declined 9.7 percent to a rate of 298,000 units. Multi-family housing starts have now declined for five straight months. 
With rental increases appearing to have leveled off after strong gains over the last few years, there is probably limited room for strong growth in the construction of multi-family homes.
Building permits last month fell 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.17 million units, the lowest level since April 2016. That suggests homebuilding could remain weak in the coming months.

Exports were seen rising 16.1 percent in May from a year ago, up for a sixth straight month and the strongest gain since a 16.9 percent jump in January 2015, the poll of 19 economists found.
Japan's exports and factory output have benefited from a pick-up in overseas demand, and the Bank of Japan has upgraded its assessment of private consumption and overseas growth, signaling its confidence that an export-driven economic recovery was broadening and gaining momentum.
""The global economy is recovering, led by a pickup in emerging economies. The rising trend in exports will likely continue this year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
Imports are expected to be up 14.8 percent from a year earlier, up for a fifth straight month, and boosted by rising liquefied natural gas, coal and oil prices.
""Oil price gains increased import costs. In addition to that, the domestic economy is solid which also contributed to import growth,"" Minami added.
Nonetheless, Japan is likely to post a trade surplus of 76.0 billion yen ($683.64 million) in May, the poll found.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>","European car sales rise 7.7 percent in May, nearing pre-crisis levels","MILAN (Reuters) - European car sales rose 7.7 percent in May from the same month a year ago, industry data showed on Friday, returning to growth after a dip in April and with nearly all auto manufacturers recording sales increases. 
New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA). 
""In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,"" the industry group said in a statement.
European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms.
The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain.
May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki (T:7269) and Toyota (T:7203), up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), up 14 percent. 
Sales from the  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand. 
France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group (PA:PEUP), whose sales increased 4.8 percent.
Sales at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent.
The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent.
All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent. 

In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2017 11:52AM ET</span>",U.S. jobs market tightens; inflation pressures cooling,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth. 
Inflation could remain sluggish for a while as other data on Thursday showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in 15 months in May. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second time this year amid expectations of moderate economic growth and further strengthening in the labor market.
""Labor is scarce and separations are low as companies try and hang onto skilled labor,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""At present, it appears the labor market data rather than the inflation data are in the driving seat for data-dependent Fed policy.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday, better then economists' expectations for a decline to 242,000. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 119 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
While monthly job growth has slowed, record high job openings suggest that is likely because companies cannot find qualified workers. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 6,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended June 3. 
The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for nine straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.
The upbeat labor market data helped to lift the dollar against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, led by technology shares amid worries over stretched valuations.
MIXED FACTORY DATA
In another report, the Labor Department said import prices declined 0.3 percent last month as the cost of imported petroleum products tumbled. That was the biggest drop since February 2016 and followed a 0.2 percent increase in April.
In the 12 months through May, import prices rose 2.1 percent, the smallest gain since last December. Import prices rose 3.6 percent year-on-year in April.
The slowdown in import prices suggests domestic inflation could remain soft for a while. Consumer inflation measures have slowed in recent months, retreating below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
The Fed on Wednesday acknowledged the ebb in price pressures and said it expected annual inflation rates to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the target over the medium term. 
In May, import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after increasing 0.3 percent in April. They increased 1.0 percent in the 12 months through May.
""Not enough to stir up inflation pressures,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production fell 0.4 percent last month, weighed down by a 2.0 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly. With auto sales slowing and inventories bloated, motor vehicle production could remain a drag on factory output for a while.
Manufacturing output jumped 1.1 percent in April. It rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months to May, pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
That was supported by a survey from the New York Fed showing its Empire State current business conditions index surged 21 points to 19.8 in June, the highest reading since September 2014.
While another survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed a measure of business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 27.6 this month from 38.8 in May, unfilled orders and delivery times increased.

""This gives us some comfort that any deterioration in the manufacturing sector is not going to be especially severe,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The Federal Reserve said on Thursday manufacturing production dropped 0.4 percent last month, the second decline in three months. After downward revisions to data for prior months, factory output was lower in May than it was in February.
Analysts had expected factory output to rise a modest 0.1 percent.
But output fell across manufacturing industries, with motor vehicles and parts production dropping 2 percent and output for fabricated metal products down 0.7 percent. If not for a 1.1 percent surge in chemicals output, manufacturing would have fallen more.
Overall industrial production was flat last month, with a 1.6 percent increase in mining and a 0.4 percent gain in utilities countering the factory weakness.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, had been regaining ground as the prolonged drag from lower oil prices, a strong dollar and an inventory overhang faded.

But last month, manufacturing capacity utilization, which measures how fully factories are deploying their resources, fell 0.3 percentage point to 75.5 percent.
Overall industrial capacity utilization fell 0.1 percentage point to 76.6 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, suggesting a softening in domestic demand that could limit the Federal Reserve's ability to continue raising interest rates this year.
The Fed on Wednesday increased borrowing costs for the second time this year, while acknowledging the recent moderation in inflation pressures. Policymakers continued to expect the economy to expand at a ""moderate"" pace and labor market conditions to ""strengthen somewhat"" further.
""The latest inflation data have undoubtedly helped the case of officials arguing for waiting more than three months for the next move,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, weighed down by declining prices for gasoline, apparel, airline fares, motor vehicles, communication and medical care services, among others. 
The second drop in the CPI in three months followed a 0.2 percent rise in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November, after advancing 2.2 percent in April.
The year-on-year gain in the CPI in May was still larger than the 1.6 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years. Economists had forecast the CPI unchanged last month and advancing 2.0 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent in May after a similar gain in April as rents continued to increase moderately. The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.5 percent. The Fed said on Wednesday it expected annual inflation rates to ""remain somewhat"" below 2 percent in the near term but stabilize around the central bank's target over the medium term. Chair Janet Yellen said they were monitoring inflation developments closely. 
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, and said it would start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities this year.
The dollar fell to a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the data, before retracing some of the losses. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rallied, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
EYES ON INFLATION 
Economists say the weakness in inflation, if sustained, could put further monetary tightening in jeopardy.
""Clearly officials will be mindful of incoming inflation trends in the coming months before greater confidence can be made with second half of the year policy normalization plans,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending after a 0.4 percent increase in April. May's drop was the largest since January 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain. 
Retail sales rose 3.8 percent in May on a year-on-year basis. While some of the drop in monthly retail sales reflected lower gasoline prices, which weighed on receipts at service stations, sales at electronics and appliance stores recorded their biggest decline since March 2010. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and foodservices, retail sales were unchanged last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have increased 0.2 percent in April.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Despite last month's weak core retail sales reading, low inflation could translate into higher consumer spending in the calculation of GDP.
The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, held back by a near stall in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory investment.

Output increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the October-December period. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.

(Reuters) - U.S. applications to refinance an existing home climbed to a near seven-month peak last week as 30-year mortgage rates fell for a fourth straight week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on refinancing rose 9.2 percent from the prior week to 1,494.8 in the week of June 9. This was the highest level since 1,754.2 in the Nov. 18 week.
Declining borrowing costs may encourage more homeowners to seek new loans to either reduce their mortgage rates or borrow against the equity in their homes, analysts said.
""We might see a burst of refinancing activity,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at  Fannie Mae  in Washington.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.13 percent, the lowest since the week of Nov. 11, from 4.14 percent the prior week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.01 to 0.02 percentage point lower than the prior week.
Home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields as recent economic data raised doubts whether inflation would be stuck below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal for longer than previously thought.
On Wednesday, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) fell to 2.11 percent, their lowest level since Nov. 10, in reaction to data that showed consumer inflation rose less than what traders had expected for a third straight month in May.
Last week's decline in mortgage rates, however, failed to spur requests for loans to buy a home.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to home purchase, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.8 percent to 254.6 last week. 
In the preceding week, the group's purchase activity index reached its highest level since the week of May 2, 2010.
The group's seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications increased 2.8 percent to 442.6, its highest level since the week of Nov. 18.
The share of refinancing expanded to 45.4 percent of total applications from 42.1 percent the previous week.

The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in April.

The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April. May's increase was just below the 1.8 percent average annual increase over the past decade. 
Last month, rental costs increased 0.3 percent, matching April's gain. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence advanced 0.2 percent after a similar increase in April.
Gasoline prices tumbled 6.4 percent, the largest drop since February 2016, after jumping 1.2 percent in April. Food prices rose for a fifth straight month.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc rose by 0.5 percent from March, in line with market expectations.
Year-on-year output in April output went up 1.4 percent, slightly higher than market forecasts of a 1.3 percent rise.
The solid increase of industrial output was compounded by upwardly revised figures for March when production rose 0.2 percent on the month, and 2.2 percent on the year.
Eurostat had previously estimated a 0.1 percent drop on the month in March and a 1.9 percent rise on the year.
In a separate release, Eurostat said employment in the euro zone in the first quarter grew by 0.4 percent on the quarter and by 1.5 percent on the year.
In absolute terms, 154.8 million people were employed in the euro zone in the first quarter, the highest number ever recorded and surpassing the previous peak in the first quarter of 2008, Eurostat said.
Eurostat also revised up employment its figures for the last quarter of 2016, when the rate of employed people rose 0.4 percent on the quarter and 1.4 percent on the year. It had previously estimated increases of 0.3 percent on the quarter and 1.1 percent on the year. 
The positive figures bode well for the bloc's growth in the second quarter, after overall 0.6 percent expansion in the first three months of the year.
The April increase in industrial output was mostly due to a sharp 4.7 percent rise on the month in energy production.
Output went also up by 0.6 percent for durable consumer goods, such as fridges or cars, in a sign that consumers were ready to spend on more expensive items.
Production also increased for non-durable consumer goods, such as food and clothing, by 0.2 percent on the month, and for intermediate goods by 0.1 percent.

The only indicator that in April recorded a drop was for capital goods for which output went down by 0.7 percent on the month, after a 0.9 percent rise in March.

The figures showed the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May and her new government, with signs that households are feeling the strain of rising prices since last year's vote to leave the European Union, weighing on the broader economy.
The data also showed the unemployment rate in the period between February and April held steady at a more than four-decade low of 4.6 percent, in line with the median forecast for Wednesday's figure in a Reuters poll of economists.
Inflation hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent in May, official data showed on Tuesday, stronger than economists had expected.
The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that workers' total earnings including bonuses after taking into account inflation fell by an annual 0.4 percent in the three months to April after edging up 0.1 percent in the first quarter.
That marked the biggest real-terms drop since the three months to September 2014.
In nominal terms, wages grew at the slowest pace since February 2016, rising an annual 2.1 percent in the three months to April and slowing from 2.3 percent in the first quarter.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 2.4 percent.
The ONS said it had revised its data for wages to improve methodology for earnings from small businesses, resulting in lower estimates for wage levels but little change overall to growth rates.
Excluding bonuses, nominal earnings rose by 1.7 percent year-on-year, the weakest increase since January 2015 and against expectations for a 2.0 percent rise.
The Bank of England is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation is creating longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019.
The central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent when it makes its latest policy announcement on Thursday.
The number of people in work increased by 109,000 in the three months to April, taking the employment rate to 74.8 percent, a joint record high, the Office for National Statistics said.
So far the central bank believes there is little pressure on most employers to raise pay sharply which could feed a more permanent inflation problem.

Global concerns about China have resurfaced since Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings last month, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. 
But most analysts predict only a gradual loss of momentum in coming months, especially as the government is keen to maintain economic and financial market stability ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle in autumn.
May data released on Wednesday appeared to reinforce that consensus view, with still solid factory output and retail sales, and only a slight slowdown in fixed asset investment.
However, property investment and construction showed a much sharper deceleration after a slew of government cooling measures in recent months.
Factory output rose 6.5 percent in May from a year earlier, statistics bureau data showed on Wednesday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted factory output would grow 6.3 percent in May, easing slightly from 6.5 percent in April.
But, for now, manufacturing activity still appeared to be well supported by a year-long construction boom fueled by a government infrastructure spree and a heated property market. Sales of excavating machines doubled in May from a year earlier, according to an industry website.
Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 8.6 percent in the first five months of the year. It had been expected to slip to 8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in Jan-April.
Growth of private investment slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in January-May period from 6.9 percent in the first four months, the National Bureau of Statistics said, suggesting a slight weakening of the private sector's appetite to invest as small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing financing.
Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
Retail sales were more upbeat, rising 10.7 percent in May from a year earlier, unchanged from April and above analysts' expectations for a 10.6 percent rise due to slowing auto sales.
China's vehicle sales in May posted their first back-to-back drop since 2015 after the government rolled back a tax incentive that had boosted car sales and output last year.
OUTLOOK FOR 2018 MORE WORRISOME?
Despite expectations the economy will lose some steam later this year, most economists believe Beijing should still easily meet its full-year growth target of 6.5 percent, coasting along after an unexpectedly strong first quarter.
But some China watchers are more worried about the risks of sharp slowdown next year.
A fund manager survey released by BofA Merrill Lynch this week found Chinese credit tightening ranked as the top tail risk for global investors in June for the second straight month, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying tighter monetary policy will slow activity in the country but have little impact on global growth.
Early warning indicators of a financial crisis are already flashing red, economists at Nomura said in a note this week, echoing the warnings of others such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

""Enjoy the party but stay close to the door,"" said Nomura, predicting growth will slow sharply to 6.2 percent in 2018 and adding there could be a greater risk of financial turmoil.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices were unchanged in May as energy costs recorded their biggest decline in more than a year, suggesting a moderation in inflation after a rise at the start of the year.
Inflation at the factory gate, however, remains supported by sustained increases in the cost of services as well as a softening dollar, which is lifting prices of some imported goods. 
""Inflation down at the producer level of the economy's factory-to-consumer supply chain remains on the warm side, which is in keeping with the economy moving beyond full employment,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that last month's unchanged reading in its producer price index for final demand followed a 0.5 percent jump in April. 
In the 12 months through May the PPI increased 2.4 percent, retreating from April's 2.5 percent surge, which was the biggest yearly increase since February 2012. Last month's inflation readings were broadly in line with economists' expectations.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services fell 0.1 percent last month, the first decline in a year. The so-called core PPI rose 0.7 percent in April. The core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through May after a similar gain in April. 
Federal Reserve officials were scheduled to start a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday and offer details on plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure that is currently at 1.5 percent. It raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March.
Economists believe further monetary policy tightening this year will hinge on the inflation outlook. 
ENERGY PRICES FALL
Prices of U.S. government debt were trading lower on Tuesday, while the dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) hitting a record intraday high as bank stocks advanced in anticipation of a rate hike.
Energy prices fell 3.0 percent last month, the biggest drop since February 2016, after rising 0.8 percent in April. The cost of gasoline declined 11.2 percent in May, which was also the largest decline since February of last year.
As a result, the cost of goods fell 0.5 percent, reversing April's 0.5 percent increase. 
But prices for services rose 0.3 percent last month, driven by a 1.1 percent surge in the index for final demand trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.
Services increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through May, the largest gain since December 2014.
Food costs fell 0.2 percent as the prices of fresh fruits and melons recorded their biggest drop since June 2010. But the cost of beef and veal increased by the most since July 2008. Food prices surged 0.9 percent in April.

The cost of healthcare services fell 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in April. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index.

630,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2017 08:33AM ET</span>","U.S. producer prices flat in May, missing forecasts","Investing.com - Producer price inflation in the U.S. was flat from a month before although other readings, including core prices, came out slightly ahead of estimates, official data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices were unchanged last month, lower than the forecast for a 0.1% advance and compared to the 0.5% gain seen in April.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.4% in May, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.3% and following a 2.5% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, advanced by 0.3% in May, higher than forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior month’s 0.4% rise.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 2.1% last month, compared to forecasts for a 2.0% increase and a gain of 1.9% in April.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with weekly jobless claims, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1213 from around 1.1218 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2726 from 1.2734 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 110.13 from 110.00 earlier.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2017 05:27AM ET</span>","British inflation jumps again in May, tightening squeeze on consumers","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly jumped to its highest level in nearly four years in May, tightening the squeeze on consumers who now face the added worry of political uncertainty after last week's inconclusive election.
The impact of the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote made itself felt as the higher costs of foreign holidays and of imported computer games and equipment helped push up consumer prices by 2.9 percent year-on-year.
That was its biggest annual increase since June 2013, the Office for National Statistics said, and was above the median forecast of 2.7 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
It is also faster than the growth in pay for most people who have suffered a squeeze on their incomes almost without break for a decade.
Data due to be released on Wednesday is likely to show basic pay rose by an annual 2.0 percent in the three months to April, according to another Reuters poll.
Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by the loss of her parliamentary majority in the election, has accepted that voters' patience with austerity is at an end, the Times reported on Tuesday.
Despite the stronger-than-expected consumer price inflation figures, the pound fell slightly after the ONS data, possibly reflecting a slowing of the surge in prices faced by factories which hints at slower inflation ahead for households.
Paul Hollingsworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said he believed the data showed the drop in the pound has fed through into inflation more quickly than expected.
""While we think that CPI inflation will peak at a little above 3 percent before the end of this year, it is likely to drop back fairly quickly in 2018,"" he said.
The ONS said one of the main drivers for inflation in May was the increased cost of package holidays abroad for British tourists who have to pay more for their euros and dollars.
Another big push on prices came from computer games and equipment, which are typically imported and therefore reflect the diminished buying power of sterling since the Brexit vote. 
Inflation has picked up speed broadly around the world but in Britain there is extra pressure from the fall in sterling, contributing to a sharp slowdown in British economic growth since the start of this year.
Credit card firm Visa said on Monday it saw the first annual fall in spending by consumers in nearly four years in May.
That was before last week's shock election result that has raised questions about how May will advance her plans to take Britain out of the European Union, and push other legislation.
A survey of executives published on Monday showed business confidence plunging after the election.
FACTORY COSTS SURGE EASING
Despite the sharp rise in prices, the Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday.
The BoE has said it will tolerate inflation above its target of 2 percent because so far there has been no knock-on effect on pay which could generate a longer-lasting inflation problem.
But the BoE had previously said it only expected inflation to reach the kind of levels it has now hit at the end of this year. 
Some economists have said Britain's political turmoil is likely to make the BoE more cautious about considering a rate hike and could even lead it to revive its massive bond-buying program if the economy weakens further.
The BoE was also likely to take comfort from the data which showed inflationary pressures might be easing.
Input prices for factories fell by 1.3 percent in month-on-month terms in May, taking the yearly rate of price growth down to 11.6 percent from a downwardly revised 15.6 percent in April, its slowest annual growth rate since last September.
Growth in prices charged by factories held steady at an annual 3.6 percent, in line with the Reuters poll.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 2.9% last month. That was above forecasts for the reading to remain steady at April’s 2.7% and was the highest rate of annual inflation since June 2013.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose by 0.3% in May, compared to forecasts for a 0.2% increase and the 0.5% gain registered in the previous month.
The ONS indicated that rising prices for recreational and cultural goods and services (particularly games, toys and hobbies) was the main contributor to the increase in the rate along with smaller upward contributions from increased electricity and food prices.
“These upward contributions were partially offset by falls in motor fuel prices, and air and sea fares, the latter two influenced by the timing of Easter in April this year,” the ONS said.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.6% last month, higher than forecasts for it to remain on hold at April’s reading of 2.4%.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 3.7% in May, after rising by 3.5% the previous month. Analysts had expected no change to April’s increase.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.4% in May, compared to a 0.5% advance in the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.3% gain.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 3.9% in May, after rising by 3.8% the previous month. Economists had expected a repeat of April’s performance.
Month-on-month, core RPI increased 0.4% last month, compared to April’s 0.5% rise.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.6% in May, above forecasts for a gain of 3.7% and following a 4.5% increase a month earlier. April’s data was revised from an initial 4.1% rise.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.2707 from around 1.2705 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8824 from 0.8827 earlier and GBP/JPY changed hands at 139.95, compared to 139.98 previously.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's descent into political crisis just days before Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence among business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU.
The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.
May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a ""hard Brexit"" -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.
Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.
""The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,"" a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election."" 
A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.
The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.
""It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,"" said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD. 
The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year's Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods. 
Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year's Brexit vote. 
And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.
Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.
Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a 'softer Brexit', with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration. 
""Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn't think used to happen in the UK,"" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.
""But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.""
Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.
LEFT IN LIMBO
Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors. 
Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit. 
Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (L:LOOK), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered ""uncharted waters"" in terms of how many new cars it could sell. 
And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (L:WPP), the world's largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant ""weak investment and postponement of decision making.""
""Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,"" he said. 
Bankers, at the heart of London's huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.
""So long as uncertainty is there I don't see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,"" Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.
Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have. 

""I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. inflation expectations tumbled last month, with one key measure hitting its lowest level since early 2016, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey that could amplify the central bank's concern over a broad slump in prices. 
The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly valuable gauge for the Fed, showed on Monday that median three-year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 2.47 percent last month, from 2.91 percent in April. That brought the measure to a 16-month low after it had hovered near a record high the last six months.
The one-year measure slid to 2.59 percent in May, from 2.79 percent in April, hitting a six month low. The New York Fed added that ""inflation uncertainty"" among respondents remained at a low water mark since the survey began in mid-2013. 
The sharp decline, driven by younger respondents, is the latest hint that a soft patch in U.S. inflation could expand and slow the Fed's plan to raise interest rates at a pace of about three times per year.
Fed policymakers are expected to hike rates a notch this week, their third tightening in six months, though price concerns have already cooled market expectations for further hikes. They have so far struck a balanced tone as the Consumer Price Index has disappointed in two straight months, and as the Fed's preferred measure slipped further below target. 
In a recent speech, Fed Governor Lael Brainard painted a ""mixed"" picture of inflation indicators and noted the New York Fed's three-year measure was at ""its highest level in more than a year"" in April. 

But on Monday, the New York Fed said the pull-back in May was driven by all income groups and largest among lower-income households. The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, said he expected about 5.5 million tourists this year.
""Cambodia has clearly established itself as an attractive destination for cultural and natural tourism,"" Hun Sen said at an international tourism conference in Siem Reap province.
Hun Sen projected there would be seven million tourist arrivals by 2020, which should earn the country $5.5 billion and create 800,000 jobs.
Despite its beaches and Angkor temples, Cambodia long had a reputation for war, genocide and violent political instability.
But it has been become a favorite with backpackers and budget travelers over the past decade or so and has more recently begun to establish itself as a luxury destination.
Foreign tourist arrivals rose 11.9 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to figures from the Tourism Ministry, with a total of 1.5 million visitors from January to March.
Chinese tourists accounted for the biggest group of visitors in the first quarter, data showed.
Kong Sopheareak, director of the Tourism Ministry's statistics department, told Reuters that good ties between Phnom Penh and Beijing had contributed to an increase in Chinese arrivals.
""There are more direct flights now and Chinese tourists also seek investment opportunities when they visit,"" he added.

May failed to win a parliamentary majority in the election. Her hopes of forming a government now lie with winning support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in the election. [nL8N1J8039]
The IoD found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the UK economy from its last survey in May.
While 20 percent of members were optimistic about the economy over the next 12 months, some 57 percent were either quite or very pessimistic - a -37 ""net confidence"" score. That compares with a -3 percent score in May.
""It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,"" said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.
""The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government.""
The IoD survey said its members saw no clear way to quickly resolve the political situation, feeling that a further election this year would have a negative impact on the economy.
They are keen to see quick agreement with the European Union on transitional arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the bloc, and clarity on the status of EU workers in Britain.
BUSINESS NEED 
Also on Monday, Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said there was now a risk that businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year's Brexit vote.
""When uncertainty reaches such a level then you get pause buttons beginning to be pressed and we don't want to see that,"" she told the BBC. 
""So I think it's time for a bit of a reset, a bit of a mindset change to listen really well to what businesses need.""
Fairbairn said she hoped to see the Brexit negotiations on ""a really positive track so we can see an outcome on really good access to the single market.""

647,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2017 02:40AM ET</span>",China's monthly vehicle sales post first back-to-back drop since 2015,"By Stella Qiu and Jake Spring
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese auto sales edged down 0.1 percent from a year ago in May, registering two consecutive months of declines for the first time since 2015, as the rollback of a government tax incentive dragged on demand.
China auto sales fell to 2.1 million vehicles in May, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Monday. In April, sales dropped 2.2 percent, the steepest fall in 20 months.
In the first five months of 2017, sales grew 3.7 percent from year-ago levels, the association said at a briefing in Beijing. This was smaller than the 7 percent growth seen over January-May 2016 and also trails CAAM's forecast for 5 percent growth this year.
China's auto market, the world's largest, recorded a 13.7 percent growth in sales last year after the government halved the purchase tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or below to 5 percent to stimulate demand. 
The tax climbed to 7.5 percent this year and will rise to the normal 10 percent next year.
""Last year was just too strong and now the policy impact is fading away,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. 
""The growth (last year) overdrew some of the demand."" 
Sedan sales fell 9.3 percent year-on-year in May, with sport-utility vehicles proving to be the lone bright spot for passenger vehicles, growing by 13.5 percent as Chinese continue to trade up to larger vehicles.
Foreign brands that are strong in the small sedan segment have seen sales slow this year, with General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) all recording lower sales in the first five months of the year.

Meanwhile, commercial vehicles posted rapid growth, led by lorry sales that grew 18.3 percent, which are usually linked to the strength of the overall economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell more than expected in April, casting doubt on the strength of companies' capital spending and adding to concerns about the country's fragile economic recovery.
The 3.1 percent fall in the core orders from a month earlier was much bigger than the 1.3 percent decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll, potentially dragging on economic growth in the current quarter.
It also marked the first drop in three months, following a 1.4 percent increase in March, the Cabinet Office data showed.
Though the machinery order data, which excludes ships and orders from the electric power utilities, is highly volatile, it is regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months.
The reading follows a surprisingly sharp downward revision to first-quarter economic growth, as a reduction in inventories put annualized growth at 1.0 percent, much slower than the initially estimated 2.2 percent.
More recently, a run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to still solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market.
Policymakers are hoping that Japanese firms will tap their hefty profits to spur investment and boost wages to stoke a sustainable growth cycle.
""Capital expenditure will likely remain lackluster in the current quarter,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Exports and factory output are performing well on the back of global economic recovery and a weak yen, but uncertainty over U.S. President (Donald) Trump's trade policy makes Japanese firms hesitant about domestic investment.""
By sector, core orders from manufacturers rose 2.5 percent in April, up for a third straight month.
The gains were led by orders from electrical machinery companies for semiconductor production equipment and computers, and all-purpose industrial machinery firms.
Orders from the services sector fell 5.0 percent, dragged down by orders from financial and insurance firms for computer systems, down for a second consecutive month.
""The 3.1 percent may appear a big drop, but overall core orders held firm, centering on manufacturers,"" said a senior Cabinet Office official.
Orders from manufacturers would have logged a double-digit gain if a one-off pullback in orders from nonferrous metal firms for nuclear-powered motors was excluded.
Orders from abroad, which were not counted as core orders, jumped 17.4 percent in April, up for the first time in three months.
The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment of machinery orders, saying the pick-up was stalling, using the same assessment for an eighth straight month.
Still, the Bank of Japan is set to upgrade its economic assessment as early as this week to signal its growing conviction the recovery is gathering momentum, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters last week.

Such an upgrade would reinforce expectations that the BOJ's next move would be to tighten monetary policy, though analysts do not expect it will begin to do so anytime soon.

Consumer spending in May was 0.8 percent lower than in the same month in 2016 after adjusting for inflation, the first year-on-year fall since September 2013, Visa said on Monday.
Sales fell by a hefty 1.9 percent in monthly terms. 
""Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze,"" Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said.
Britain's economy has shown signs that it is stagnating and confidence among businesses and consumers it expected to take a further hit after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election. 
She now plans to lead a minority government with support from Northern Ireland's main unionist party, raising questions about how Britain will progress in Brexit talks and whether another election might be called soon.
After shrugging off the initial impact of last year's vote to leave the European Union, the effects of sterling's more than 10 percent fall is catching up with Britons in the form of higher inflation, which is its strongest since September 2013.
Sterling weakened again after last week's inconclusive election result and businesses have said the election result risks paralyzing the government at a time when it is meant to be negotiating a smooth exit from the European Union. [nL8N1J631M]
Retail sales in the first three months of 2017 suffered their biggest fall since 2010. Data published on Friday showed industrial output and construction faltered again in April.
Britain's overall economy was the weakest performer among the Group of Seven rich nations in the first quarter of 2017.
Visa said bricks-and-mortar retailers suffered their biggest fall in sales in five years, which was only partly offset by strong growth in online sales. Growth in spending at hotels and restaurants - which has risen much faster than at retailers in recent quarters - slowed to an annual 3.3 percent.
Spending on transport and clothing were the categories with the biggest falls.
""The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth,"" said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the data for Visa.
""The squeeze on household finances is likely to get worse as the Bank of England forecasts faster increases in consumer prices in the coming months,"" she added.

The Visa figures strip out seasonal and inflation effects, and are adjusted to take account of the growing share of spending on cards rather than cash.

Economic hardship in the country, where many are skipping food and there are severe shortages, is helping fuel opposition protests that have led to at least 67 deaths in the last two months.
Various factors underlay the five-month price rise, including excess money-printing by the central bank, restrictions on imports and a recent devaluation of the bolivar, opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado said.
May inflation was 18.26 percent, he added, presenting the latest opposition-calculated index. 
President Nicolas Maduro's government has not published official data for more than a year. 
Government opponents say Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, have wrecked a once-prosperous economy with 18 years of state-led socialist policies ranging from nationalizations to currency controls.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>","Even before new political chaos, British economy was limping","By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy appeared to be struggling to pick up pace even before Friday's inconclusive election result, with industrial output rising less than expected in April after a poor start to 2017.
The combination of a lack of economic momentum and the heightened uncertainty about how Prime Minister Theresa May can advance her plans for Brexit might prompt her new government to relax its grip on spending, some analysts said.
Industrial output rose 0.2 percent on the month in April after falling for three months. It was much weaker than a forecast 0.8 percent, and over a three-month period it contracted for the first time since November, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.
Manufacturing, which is part of overall industrial output, also saw output rise 0.2 percent in April, compared with a forecast of 0.9 percent in the Reuters poll.
The construction sector was much weaker than expected too.
After last year's shock decision by voters to pull Britain out of the European Union, Britain is now facing more political upheaval after May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority.
""There is clearly a risk that today's election result causes growth to weaken towards the end of the second quarter,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said. ""That said, this is unlikely to spell disaster since the economy has proved pretty resilient to political uncertainty in the recent past.""
Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2017, making it the worst performer among the Group of Seven nations after outpacing its peers in 2016, despite the shock of the Brexit vote.
As well as rising inflation and slow wage growth weighing on consumers, the economy now has to contend with heightened political uncertainty about Britain's ability to proceed with its plan to leave the European Union.
Britain's economy grew by a below-par 0.2 percent in the three months to May, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, said on Friday. 
""The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung parliament into sharp relief,"" NIESR director Jagjit Chadha said. ""People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages.""
BOE BACK IN ACTION?
Investors are watching closely to see if May responds to the increase in support for the opposition Labour Party by relaxing her grip on public spending, something which would boost the economy.
Chris Iggo, fixed income chief investment officer at AXA Investment Managers, said that if the government failed to boost the economy, the Bank of England might resort to reviving its massive bond-buying program again.
The BoE said before the election that it expected some of the impact of slower consumer spending would be eased by stronger exports driven by the pound's fall since the Brexit vote last year.
ONS data showed on Friday that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed by more than expected to 10.4 billion pounds ($13.2 billion) in April. 
But the smaller deficit was due to a sharp fall in goods imports with volumes in monthly terms down more than 5 percent in April, almost reversing a surge in March. Exports edged down.
Over the three months to April, goods exports rose 2.1 percent while imports were flat. But the ONS said there was no sign yet that exporters were taking advantage of sterling's weakness to cut their foreign-currency prices and strengthen their competitive advantage.
""Britain won't enjoy a trade boost until exporters reduce margins and seek greater market share instead,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

The ONS said construction output in April fell by 1.6 percent from March and was down 0.6 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent on the month but a fall of 0.4 percent compared with April last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders likely fell for the first time in three months in April, a Reuters poll showed, but analysts believe companies' capital spending plans remain solid as the global economy recovers.
The poll also showed that the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged next week as the economy is growing modestly despite weak inflation and consumer spending.
""Core machinery orders will be viewed as moving sideways. But we expect a trend of pickup will become clearer supported by upbeat corporate earnings,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There is a high chance that core machinery orders in April-June will be better than companies' forecast of a 5.9 percent fall for the period.""
Core machinery orders likely fell 1.3 percent in April from the previous month after a 1.4 percent rise in March, the Reuters poll of 15 economists showed.
From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical equipment, rose 6.3 percent in April.
While the data series is highly volatile, it is regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months. 
""Exports and factory output continue to be favorable due to the global economic recovery and a weaker yen, but uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy makes corporations cautious about domestic investment,"" said an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Cabinet Office will announce machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT).
As for the BOJ, analysts expect it will keep its short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent at a two-day policy meeting on June 15-16.
""The focus next week will be BOJ Governor (Haruhiko) Kuroda's comment on what the central bank's stance on how to communicate with markets about an exit strategy,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute. 
The central bank is set to upgrade its economic assessment as early as next week to signal its growing conviction the recovery is gathering momentum, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters, reinforcing expectations its next move would be to tighten monetary policy.
The poll showed the BOJ's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, grew 2.2 percent in May from a year ago, up for a fifth straight month partly boosted by oil price increases.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 12:13AM ET</span>",China's easing factory gate prices hint at broader economic slowdown,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation eased for the third straight month in May on tumbling prices of raw materials, signaling a broader cooling in economic activity as profits are squeezed by slackening domestic demand and rising financing costs.
Moderating factory gate inflation in the world's second-biggest economy could be a further worry for global central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which are puzzling over why domestic prices have remained sluggish despite improving economic growth.
China's producer price index (PPI) rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, versus an expected gain of 5.7 percent and slower than the 6.4 percent increase in April.
""Declines in non-food inflation and producer price inflation still point to an easing of broader price pressures,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. 
""More importantly, however, we expect price pressures elsewhere to continue to ease as economic activity slows, disappointing hopes for a sustained period of reflation that would help erode corporate debt burdens.""
A renaissance in China's steel industry has been a major driver of the world's second-largest economy in recent quarters, helping to generate the strongest profit growth in years and adding to a reflationary pulse across the global manufacturing sector.
Now, however, the opposite may be true as cooling factory gate prices in China appear to be filtering through to benign inflation readings in the United States and Europe. 
""Given the strong relation between raw materials PPI and import prices (available later this month), the dip in raw materials PPI indicates the reflation trade is at least stalling, if not outright dying for Asia (and the world),"" Vaninder Singh, Asia economist at NatWest Markets, wrote in a note.
SLOW DEMAND, PROFIT SQUEEZE
Analysts are also worried that market demand won't be strong enough to absorb the surging supplies of steel from the world's top producer.
""There was an improvement in demand,"" said CRU analyst Richard Lu. ""But we don't think it will be sustainable because we're approaching summer when construction usually slows down.""
China's biggest steelmaker, Baoshan Iron & Steel (SS:600019) cut its main steel products prices for May and June after a long series of increases.
Factory gate prices had only turned positive on a year-on-year basis last September, after falling for nearly five years, leaving many industrial firms saddled with idle capacity and less cash flow to service their debts.
Analysts expect China's economy to cool in coming months after a strong first quarter, with recent factory activity data also indicating a gradual slowdown is underway. 
A flurry of official measures targeting financial deleveraging is expected to further squeeze financing costs, eroding profits and broad economic activity over the remainder of the year.
The consumer price index (CPI) in May rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, accelerating from April's 1.2 percent increase, and in line with market expectations.
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index (CPI), fell at a slower 1.6 percent pace from the previous year, after sliding 3.5 percent in April. 
China has set its inflation target at 3 percent in 2017, the same as the year before, suggesting policy makers still have room to tighten financial conditions after years of debt-fueled stimulus.

The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed consumption, including healthcare spending, increased at a faster clip than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month.
Economists said the data suggested first-quarter consumer spending could be lifted by as much as eight-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third GDP estimate on June 29. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was reported last month to have grown at the start of the year at its slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009. 
""This revision should be partially related to health care consumption, but other spending categories will likely play a role as well,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The QSS data suggested first-quarter GDP could be revised up to as high as a 1.5 percent annualized rate from the 1.2 percent growth pace reported in May, according to economists. 
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers said the solid services revenues implied stronger momentum for consumer spending heading into the second quarter. 
""As a result, we raised our tracking forecast of second-quarter GDP growth by one-tenth to 3.0 percent,"" Macroeconomic Advisers said.

Economists saw little impact on the first-quarter estimates for intellectual property products from the QSS data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, unwinding half of the prior period's jump and suggesting the labor market was tightening despite a recent slowdown in job growth.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 245,000 for the week ended June 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The report followed data on Tuesday showing job openings at a record high in April. 
""There is no sign of a pickup in the rate of layoffs. Against this backdrop of high job openings, firms appear to be holding on to their workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Claims surged by 20,000 in the prior week, with California, Tennessee, Kansas, and Missouri accounting for the bulk of the increase. Some of that increase was related to school summer breaks in which bus drivers and cafeteria workers were left temporarily unemployed.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 118 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 240,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 2,250 to 242,000 last week.
The dollar rose against the euro after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold but cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back the central bank's massive bond-buying program. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher.
SKILLS MISMATCH
Low layoffs and record high job openings suggest a deceleration in job growth in May was likely because companies could not find suitable workers. The economy created 138,000 jobs in May, well below the average monthly 181,000 jobs gained over the prior 12 months.
The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000.
""Labor market supply constraints are expected to bite into job creation but should also help to keep a lid on jobless claims as employers focus on retaining talent, so long as the economy continues to chug along,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Economists believe that labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March.
""The Fed will continue to view the labor market data as signalizing that the economy remains at or near full employment,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 2,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 27. The so-called continuing claims now have been below 2 million for eight straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims slipped 750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.

Liquid assets held by non-financial firms was $2.21 trillion versus a revised $2.17 trillion in the previous quarter.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew by more than previously estimated in the first quarter and at its fastest rate in two years, EU statistics agency Eurostat said on Thursday, ahead of a European Central Bank meeting that kept policy unchanged.
Eurostat said the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. That compared with earlier estimates of 0.5 and 1.7 percent respectively.
The higher figure resulted from revisions for France and Italy, with domestic demand the overall driver, particularly investment. Gross fixed capital formation was 1.3 percent higher in the quarter and up 6.0 percent year-on-year.
On an annualized basis, the euro zone economy was expanding at a rate of 2.3 percent in the Jan-March period, far outstripping the 1.2 percent rate of the United States.
Capital Economics said that purchasing manager surveys pointed to a potential pick-up to 0.7 percent growth in the second quarter.
The first quarter growth rate was the highest since the first three months of 2015, when the ECB first began printing money to boost inflation and stimulate growth.
Solid economic growth but subdued inflation has left the ECB in a quandary. ECB President Mario Draghi is yet to be convinced that a recent rebound of inflation is durable because wage growth remains sluggish.
The ECB left its aggressive stimulus unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying program and sub-zero interest rates, despite resistance from cash-rich Germany.
However, it did close the door to further rate cuts.
Eurostat said gross fixed capital formation contributed 0.3 percentage points, household consumption 0.2 points and government consumption 0.1 points to the first-quarter growth figure. The contributions of external trade and inventories was neutral.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2017 01:53AM ET</span>","China May imports, exports unexpectedly speed up but seen fading","BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported stronger-than-anticipated exports and imports for May despite falling commodity prices, suggesting the economy is holding up better than expected despite rising lending rates and a cooling property market.
Concerns over China landed squarely back on global investors' radar after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating last month, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.
China's imports have been strong in recent months, driven largely by iron ore and other commodities used to feed a year-long construction boom, while exports have rebounded from several years of contraction thanks to improving global demand.
While the strength of the May import data surprised economists, and suggested domestic demand remains solid, analysts still expect the world's second-largest economy to lose momentum gradually over the course of the year due to policy tightening.
Government measures to cool heated home prices are expected to dampen property investment eventually and a crackdown on riskier types of lending is pushing up financing costs.
""The current strength of imports is unlikely to be sustained if, as we expect, slower credit growth feeds through into weaker economic activity in the coming quarters,"" Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.
""Export growth is also likely to edge down but should fare better than imports given the relatively upbeat outlook for China's main trading partners.""
Growth in both exports and imports accelerated from April, defying expectations of a slowdown.
Exports rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports expanded 14.8 percent, official data showed on Thursday.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $40.81 billion for the month, the General Administration of Customs said.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 7.0 percent, easing from 8.0 percent growth in April.
Imports had been expected to have climbed 8.5 percent, pulling back from 11.9 percent in April. That was expected to produce a trade surplus of $46.32 billion, widening from April's $38.05 billion.
Sources at two steel mills told Reuters they expect output to remain high as profit margins and demand are still strong, even though construction activity in China tends to ease in summer due to intense heat and rain in parts of the county.
""We think it's quite obvious demand outperformed our expectations because of relatively strong housing and infrastructure sectors,"" Richard Lu, an analyst at commodities consulting firm CRU, said ahead of the data.
""But there are some downside risks in the second half of the year. Housing sales have declined so underlying (steel) demand may ease,"" he said.
The key unknown is whether China would continue to boost infrastructure spending for the rest of the year.
Much of the building boom has been fueled by government spending on road and rail projects and a frenzied housing market, even as authorities try to contain mounting risks from years of debt-fueled stimulus.
COMMODITY IMPORTS LEAD THE WAY
Analysts had expected import growth to cool largely due to a slump in prices of iron ore and steel in recent weeks on worries about growing inventories and a seasonal slowdown in demand. Iron ore prices are near eight-month lows.[IRONORE/]
But China's imports of crude oil, copper, iron ore and soybeans all rose in May from a month earlier on a volume basis, suggesting producers remain optimistic about the outlook.
""The copper imports rebound in May is more than market expectations, especially in the off season for copper, (suggesting) markets had overestimated the slowdown in China's economic growth and sluggish domestic demand,"" said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong.
EXPORTS ALSO UNDER A CLOUD?
Exports benefited from solid demand from Europe and the United States, though trade has been under a cloud since Donald Trump was elected president in November vowing to shrink the large U.S. trade deficit with China.
The world's two biggest economies have started 100 days of trade talks, which was agreed by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping when they met in Florida in April in an effort to reduce the massive U.S trade gap.
In a sign of progress, the two countries agreed in May to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expanding trade in beef and chicken among other steps.
China does not deliberately pursue a trade surplus with the United States, vice commerce minister Yu Jianhua said recently.
China's trade surplus with the U.S. was $22.0 billion in May, the highest since November and up from $21.34 billion in April, according to data from China's customs bureau.

Exports to the United States rose 11.7 percent in May from a year earlier while imports from the U.S. rose 27.1 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth was much weaker in the first quarter than initially estimated, the Cabinet Office said, but analysts made light of the decline as a ""one-off"" adjustment in oil inventories that would not thwart recovery.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, expanded at an annualized rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter, less than half the initial estimate of 2.2 percent growth and 2.4 percent gain seen by economists, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
The data follows a recent run of indicators that suggests continued economic growth in the current quarter due to solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain lackluster, despite a tight job market.
The Bank of Japan is now expected to stand pat at its next rate review on June 15-16, although a majority of the economists in a Reuters poll last month forecast the BOJ's next move would be to pull back its stimulus.
The GDP data was revised as primary oil distributors squeezed their crude oil inventory because some refineries were offline for repairs, bringing crude oil inventory levels at the end of March to the lowest since 2000, Cabinet Office officials said.
""The data is not as bad as the headline figure appears. It supports the BOJ's upbeat view on the economy,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Excluding the revision to inventory, private final demand including capital expenditure was strengthening, suggesting that export-led recovery is broadening gradually. It's true private consumption is weak, but it will likely firm up from now on.""
On the quarter, the Japanese economy grew a revised 0.3 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, against a preliminary reading of a 0.5 percent increase and the median estimate of a 0.6 percent expansion.
Capital expenditure, a key component of GDP, rose 0.6 percent for the quarter, outstripping the preliminary estimate of a 0.2 percent increase.
Inventories shaved 0.1 percentage point off growth, revised down from a 0.1 percent point contribution originally posted. 
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.3 percent, down from the preliminary 0.4 percent gain. Tame wages and consumer spending have kept Japan from beating deflation, posing a key challenge for the BOJ in meeting its 2 percent inflation goal via a massive bond-buying program.

Taken together, government, business and household demand contributed 0.1 percentage point to growth, versus the initial 0.4 percentage point recorded. Net exports added 0.1 point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary estimate.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>",Brazil inflation rate likely dropped for ninth month in May,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation rate probably fell for a ninth straight month in May, showing no sign of price pressures that could stop the central bank from cutting interest rates further in coming months, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Consumer prices likely rose 3.79 percent in the 12 months through May, down from an increase of 4.08 percent in April and well below the official target of 4.5 percent, according to the median of 24 forecasts in the survey. 
That inflation rate would be the lowest for Brazil since July 2007. Estimates ranged between 3.62 and 3.84 percent.
Prices probably rose 0.50 percent in May from April, up from a rise of 0.14 percent in the previous month, according to the median of 25 forecasts ranging between 0.45 and 0.60 percent.
National statistics agency IBGE is scheduled to release the benchmark IPCA price index on Friday at 9 a.m. (1200 GMT).
Economists expect inflation to keep slowing to about 3 percent in three months, which would probably leave the central bank comfortable to cut rates from the current 10.25 percent to around 8.5 percent by December.

The central bank has already lowered the benchmark Selic rate by 400 basis points since October in an attempt to help the economy recover from its worst recession on record.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>","China May forex reserves rise more than expected on weaker dollar, capital controls","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves rose in May for a fourth consecutive month and by more than markets had expected, as stringent capital control measures and a weakening in the dollar helped staunch outflows.
Reserves rose $24 billion in May to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion, compared with an increase of $21 billion in April, central bank data showed on Wednesday.
It was the first time since June 2014 that reserves climbed for four months in a row, and the biggest gain since reserves moved back above the closely watched $3 trillion level in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise $10 billion.
A weaker U.S. dollar boosted the value of other currencies and assets held by China in May, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement explaining the rise.
Foreign exchange supply and demand was basically balanced in the month, it added.
In May, the dollar recorded its largest monthly percentage loss against a basket of major currencies (DXY) since January.
Tighter restrictions on taking funds out of the country imposed in recent months continue to keep a lid on capital outflows, said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""From their perspective, they have done a very successful job.""
Apart from valuation effects, Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard said China's central bank may also have been purchasing small quantities of foreign currencies again in May after having sold forex to shore up the sagging yuan for 18 straight months.
""This a major shift in policy that has been achieved thanks to an easing of capital outflows,"" he said.
""Given our forecast for China’s May trade balance (due out on Thursday), today’s figures still point to capital outflows of around $10 billion last month. But this is down from $30 billion in April and $65 billion at the end of last year.""
TURNING THE TIDE?
In April, net foreign exchange sales by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) fell to the lowest in nearly two years as capital outflows eased in the face of strict regulatory curbs and a pause in the dollar's rally.
The forex regulator said last month that China's current cross-border capital flows are stabilizing, but debt risks and signs of slowing economic growth have forced policymakers to keep a tight leash on outflows.
China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994.
After steadying early this year, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> suddenly bolted to near seven-month highs in recent weeks after the central bank changed the way it calculates its official daily reference point to quash expectations of further depreciation and outflows as the U.S. raises interest rates.
The uncharacteristically rapid appreciation engineered by Chinese authorities were also seen as a show of strength and a warning to speculators after the country's credit rating was downgraded by Moody's on May 24.
The moves have prompted some investment banks to scale back views of yuan weakness this year, with some now saying it could end 2017 relatively unchanged.
In further evidence that Beijing remains concerned about a resurgence of outflows, the foreign exchange regulator announced last Friday that Chinese banks would be required to report daily on bank card holders' overseas transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan ($147).
To be sure, veteran China watchers have cautioned that Chinese companies and individuals would find ways around the capital controls eventually.
Indeed, French investment bank Natixis said in a report that its capital flow tracker for China showed outflows for the second quarter will rise somewhat, reversing the trend in the first quarter.
But while moves to stabilize the yuan may have reassured China's financial markets, they have come at a price.
Persistent depreciation fears along with China's tighter capital controls and currency interventions have dealt a setback to Beijing's ambitions to make the yuan a global currency.
On Wednesday, a central bank advisor said China should urgently reform its foreign exchange rate system or risk impeding the economy and plans for the yuan to play a larger role on the global stage.
Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told a forum in Beijing that an inflexible foreign exchange rate would limit the opening of the economy and yuan internationalization.
The yuan has slipped to the seventh-most actively traded currency for global trade finance, transaction service provider SWIFT said.
Some Western firms have also been concerned about their ability to remit profits and dividends from China.
The value of gold reserves fell to $75.004 billion at the end of May, from $75.019 billion at end-April, data published on the People's Bank of China website also showed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy squeezed out just enough growth last quarter to match the Netherlands' record of 103 quarters without recession, but its stamina is in doubt as households struggle with paltry wage rises and punishing debt. 
Government data out on Wednesday data showed gross domestic product (GDP) rose a pedestrian 0.3 percent in the first quarter, a pullback from the previous quarter's rapid 1.1 percent. 
Yet that growth allayed fears of an outright contraction and helped lift the local dollar  a third of a U.S. cent to a one-month high of $0.7542. 
""The Australian economy has had to contend with a lot of factors in the past year – geopolitics, weather events, the on-going unwinding of the mining construction boom and variable housing markets,"" said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec.
""Economic growth has trekked a zig-zag path but the bottom line is that the doomsayers will need to find another target.""
Wednesday's result should be a relief for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which just the day before conceded the March quarter would likely disappoint.
But the central bank expressed confidence growth would pick up over the next couple of years to above 3 percent, and held interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent where they have been since last August.
So far, investors seem almost convinced the RBA is done with its five-year easing campaign. The futures market <0#YIB:> implies a 16 percent chance of another rate cut by December.
Australia has not seen a recession since 1991 and growth regularly outpaced its peers in recent years. But that changed in the March quarter when annual growth braked to 1.7 percent, below the 2 percent achieved by the United States and Britain. 
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed output for the 12 months to March amounted to A$1.72 trillion ($1.28 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$71,000 for each of the country's 24 million people.
SAVE LESS OR SPEND LESS
Treasurer Scott Morrison blamed bad weather for much of the slowdown and argued things could only get better as the year progressed. Morrison launched his annual budget just a month ago and already its economic projections are looking ambitious.
Many economists suspect the current quarter will be marred by the giant cyclone that barreled through Queensland in late March and caused weeks of disruption to coal exports.
Perhaps the most worrying risk to growth is subdued consumer spending as Australians are burdened by record-low wage growth and high levels of mortgage debt. The share of GDP contributed by wages is at its lowest since September 1964. 
Household consumption grew at just 2.3 percent in the year to March, half the pace that was considered normal a decade ago. Household debt is a dangerously high 189 percent of disposable income and well above much of the rich world.
To maintain their spending habits Australians are having to save less. The savings ratio dropped to 4.7 percent in the march quarter, a fall of two full percentage points in just a year and the lowest since late 2008.
""A lot of the rise in consumption was because households further reduced their saving rate to a 10-year low,"" said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics.
""They can't do that indefinitely, so we suspect that slow income growth will soon result in more modest consumption growth. As such, we believe signs of a more sustained slowing in GDP growth are emerging.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - International travel to the United States in the month of April rose four percent year over year, an industry group reported on Tuesday, however the group cautioned that a strong dollar and uncertainty about the Trump Administration's policies could discourage foreign visitors in the months ahead.
Data released on Tuesday by the U.S. Travel Association (USTA), in partnership with Oxford Economics, showed stronger-than-expected April demand despite the initial messy rollout of President Donald Trump's order in January barring travel to the United States from several Muslim majority countries. That order has been stayed by a number of federal courts, and is now awaiting a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
April is the first month when data on international travel would reliably reflect the impact of the controversy over Trump's order, the U.S. Travel Association said.
""There have been many claims that the administration's actions on travel have tarnished America's brand abroad, but we're seeing hard economic evidence of the U.S. travel sector's remarkable resilience,"" USTA Chief Executive Officer Roger Dow said in a statement.
However, the full report cautioned that international travel to the United States in April grew at ""a slower pace than the six-month moving average"" and may have been helped by holiday travel. ""Looking ahead, a variety of factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, a fragile global economy and a turbulent political environment are expected to negatively impact international inbound travel.""
The group projected total U.S. travel volume is expected to grow by an average of 1.8 percent year-over-year through October of 2017, despite a forecast decline in international travel. 
TRAVEL WORRIES
While the airline industry is on track for an eighth successive year of profitability, travel industry executives gathered for a conference in Cancun, Mexico this week expressed concern that potential U.S. restrictions on travel would undercut their business.
""Any barrier to borders, we consider as a threat,"" International Air Transport Association director general Alexandre de Juniac told reporters ahead of the meeting. IATA represents some 275 airlines from across the globe.
De Juniac has also expressed concern about a Trump administration order barring large electronic devices, including laptop computers, from the passenger cabins of planes headed to the United States from certain Middle Eastern countries.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2017 01:15PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hit record high; skills mismatch rising,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April and employers appeared to have trouble finding suitable workers, pointing to a tightening labor market that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, published on Tuesday also suggests that a recent moderation in job growth could be the result of a skills mismatch rather than easing demand for labor.
""These data underscore the difficulty in hiring new workers, which we think is increasingly likely to be a factor restraining payroll growth going forward,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The Fed becomes somewhat uneasy when the labor market becomes too tight and this report supports the Fed's case to nudge rates higher next week.""
JOLTS is one of the metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard of labor market indicators. It came ahead of the U.S. central bank's June 13-14 policy meeting, at which it is expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 2000. 
The monthly increase was the largest in just over a year and pushed the jobs openings rate to 4.0 percent, the highest since last July, from 3.8 percent in March. 
Hiring, however, decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. That lowered the hiring rate to a one-year low of 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in March.
The gap between job openings and hiring points to a growing skills mismatch. A report from the National Federation of Independent Business last week showed the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill in May was the highest since November 2000.
FULL EMPLOYMENT
The economy created 138,000 in May, well below the average monthly job gains of 181,000 over the prior 12 months.
Economists believe tightening labor market conditions could soon unleash a faster pace of wage growth. Wage gains have remained sluggish even as the unemployment rate has tumbled to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
The JOLTS report also showed 1.6 million people were laid off in April, little changed from March. The layoffs and discharges rate was unchanged at 1.1 percent for five straight months. The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs fell by 111,000 to 3.0 million in April. 
As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in March.
""The economy has already reached the nirvana of full employment. At full employment the focus shifts from worries about the demand for labor to concerns about the supply of labor,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

""There aren't enough workers to man the factories and stock the store shelves. The supply demand imbalance is only likely to grow worse as the baby boom generation retires.""

PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa has entered recession for the first time in eight years, data showed on Tuesday, piling pressure on a government facing corruption allegations and credit downgrades.
Data from Statistics South Africa showed the first quarter contraction was led by weak manufacturing and trade, suggesting high unemployment and stagnant wages were dragging down South Africa's long-resilient consumer sector, analysts said.
Political instability, high unemployment and credit ratings downgrades have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa and the rand  extended its losses against the dollar, while government bonds also weakened .
South Africa's economy contracted by 0.7 percent in the first three months of 2017 after shrinking by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, lagging market expectations of a quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion of 0.9 percent.
It was the first time two consecutive quarters showed contraction - the definition of recession - since the second quarter of 2009, although there have been individual quarters of negative growth in more recent years.
A consumer frenzy helped the South African economy grow by an average 5 percent a year in the five years before the 2009 recession, but it has struggled to register much growth since.
""The slowdown in Q1 was due to much worse results from usually stable consumer-facing sectors that had been the key drivers of growth in recent years,"" Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said.
The worst performing sector was trade, catering and accommodation, which contracted by 5.9 percent, while manufacturing - one of the key sectors - fell by 3.7 percent.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank's Chief Africa Economist Razia Khan said the ""awful"" data showed weakness where it was not expected.
""ECONOMY IN TATTERS""
The poor growth numbers piles more pressure on the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to get the economy back on track faster as it tries to stave off further credit ratings downgrades and stem falling voter support.
The Treasury said the negative economic growth was a risk to fiscal targets and introduced ""significant downward bias"" to this year's growth estimate of 1.3 percent, up from 0.3 percent in 2016.
""The current state of the economy puts more pressure on us as government, business, labor and broader society to intensify our growth program and improve confidence as a matter of urgency to arrest the decline and set the economy on a higher growth trajectory,"" the Treasury said in a statement.
Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba would meet business leaders soon to discuss ways to achieve inclusive economic growth, the Treasury said.
Pressure on President Jacob Zuma, including from within the ANC, has risen since a controversial cabinet reshuffle in March that led to downgrades to ""junk"" status by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch and allegations of influence peddling.
Zuma has denied any wrongdoing over the allegations.
Corruption allegations escalated when local media reported this week on more than 100,000 leaked emails they say show inappropriate interference in lucrative tenders.
""Our economy is now in tatters as a direct result of an ANC government which is corrupt to the core and has no plan for our economy,"" Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said.
S&P Global Ratings and Fitch last week said risks to South Africa's ratings include weak economic growth and political uncertainty ahead of the ANC conference in December when a successor to Zuma as party leader will be chosen.
Zuma can remain as head of state until an election in 2019.

Moody's, whose Baa2 rating is two notches above ""junk"", is reviewing South Africa for a possible downgrade.

Analysts had expected the number of job openings to decline from the initial reading at the beginning of the second quarter to 5.650 million.

Retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased by 0.1 percent in April from March, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said, slightly below the average market expectation of a 0.2 percent rise.
Year-on-year, the volume of retail sales grew 2.5 percent, higher than the 2.3 percent rise forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The monthly rise in April was offset by a downward revision of March data to a 0.2 percent rise from a previously estimated 0.3 percent increase.
The year-on-year growth of sales for March was revised up to 2.5 percent from the 2.3 percent estimated earlier by Eurostat.
Despite the revision and lower-than-expected growth, it was the fourth consecutive monthly rise, a sign that shoppers seem so far to have been unaffected by the higher inflation in the bloc. It stood at 1.9 percent in April, before falling to 1.4 percent in May, according to Eurostat's flash estimates.
Retail sales increased mostly for food, drinks and tobacco products in the month containing Easter, with a 0.6 percent month-on-month rise.
Consumers reduced by 0.4 percent their purchases of non-food products, a wide category including clothes and footwear.
Retail sales also went down by 0.8 percent on the month for car fuel, as oil prices increased in April.

Among the largest economies of the euro zone, sales went down by 0.2 percent on the month in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, and by 0.1 percent in France, while they rose by 0.6 percent in Spain. April data were not available for Italy.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2017 02:50AM ET</span>",Australia central bank sticks to upbeat tune as economy underperforms,"By Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held interest rates for a 10th month on Tuesday, taking an optimistic tone on the economy even while acknowledging that growth likely slowed last quarter by more than it expected.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at a record low 1.50 percent in a widely expected move after last easing in August of 2016.
It cited a stabilization in mining investment after years of steep falls, a rebound in the price of Australia's top exports of iron ore and coal, and the country's biggest-ever home building boom.
""Looking forward, economic growth is still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 percent,"" the RBA said in a statement.
That expression of confidence was enough to lift the Australian dollar <AUD=D4> closer to a 10-day high of $0.7500 touched on Monday.
Policy makers also played down the importance of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figures due on Wednesday, which are likely to show the economy had barely grown.
""It's a pretty neutral statement from the RBA,"" said Tapas Strickland, economist at National Australia Bank.
""They are going to overlook the slowdown in GDP as a temporary blip. We think they will remain on hold until they see any signs of a pick up in the labor market.""
The futures market <0#YIB:> implies only a one-in-five chance of a cut in cash rates by year end.
The RBA described the job market as ""mixed"" with stronger employment growth offset by softness in hours worked and high levels of underemployment.
Analysts forecast the economy expanded a meager 0.2 percent in the March quarter, a step back from the previous quarter's brisk 1.1 percent.
Growth for the year is seen slowing to around 1.6 percent, from 2.4 percent, the slowest since 2009.
DEFICIT SHRINKS
A big unknown is household consumption which surprised with its strength late in 2016, but is being burdened by record-low wage growth and high levels of mortgage debt.
Data out on Tuesday showed government spending had added only marginally to growth in the quarter, restrained in part by persistent budget deficits.
Also weighing on real growth was a drop in export volumes, while imports swung higher. As a result, net exports trimmed a larger-then-expected 0.7 percentage points from growth, leading some analysts to revise down their forecasts for GDP.
The country's current account deficit did narrow to its smallest in more than 15 years at A$3.1 billion ($2.31 billion), though that disappointed hopes for a rare surplus.
The main miss came from investment income with Australians earning less from their assets abroad.
Yet the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed a barnstorming performance by commodity exports which boosted the surplus on goods and services to A$9.0 billion.
That was easily the biggest surplus since the series began in 1959 and owed much to higher prices for iron ore and coal, though those have come off their peaks in the last month or so.
The sharp improvement in the country's perennial deficit with the rest of the world should make it less vulnerable to swings in investor sentiment.
It also lessens one threat to Australia's top credit rating, which has been under pressure from persistent budget shortfalls at home. Standard & Poors recently affirmed the rating at triple-A after spending months warning that a downgrade might be warranted.

For the full-text statement, see:
Number2017-12Date6 June 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The broad-based pick-up in the global economy is continuing. Labour markets have tightened further in many countries and forecasts for global growth have been revised up since last year. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth is being supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, with the high level of debt continuing to present a medium-term risk. Commodity prices are generally higher than they were a year ago, providing a boost to Australia's national income. The prices of iron ore and coal, however, have declined over recent months as expected, unwinding some of the earlier increases.
Headline inflation rates in most countries have moved higher over the past year, partly reflecting the higher commodity prices. Core inflation remains low, as do long-term bond yields. Further increases in US interest rates are expected over the year ahead and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively.
Domestically, the transition to lower levels of mining investment following the mining investment boom is almost complete. Business conditions have improved and capacity utilisation has increased. Business investment has picked up in those parts of the country not directly affected by the decline in mining investment. Year-ended GDP growth is expected to have slowed in the March quarter, reflecting the quarter-to-quarter variation in the growth figures. Looking forward, economic growth is still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent. 
Indicators of the labour market remain mixed. Employment growth has been stronger over recent months, although growth in total hours worked remains weak. The various forward-looking indicators point to continued growth in employment over the period ahead. Wage growth remains low and this is likely to continue for a while yet. Inflation is expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthens. Slow growth in real wages is restraining growth in household consumption.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Conditions in the housing market vary considerably around the country. Prices have been rising briskly in some markets, although there are some signs that these conditions are starting to ease. In other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Rent increases are the slowest for two decades. Growth in housing debt has outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. The recent supervisory measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness. Lenders have also announced increases in mortgage rates, particularly those paid by investors and on interest-only loans.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>","Japan April real wages flat, bad sign for consumption","By Minami Funakoshi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages were flat in April from the same period a year earlier, with rising prices offsetting gains in nominal pay and possibly hurting households' purchasing power.
Real wages, which are adjusted for moves in consumer prices, were flat in April from a year earlier, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday. It followed a revised 0.3 percent annual fall in March.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose an annual 0.5 percent in April, the biggest rise in four months. Revised data showed that nominal wages were flat from a year earlier in March.
Real wage growth has been flat or even negative in the past seven months, suggesting the benefits of the recent economic recovery have yet to fully reach Japanese households. This is a headache for the government and central bank, which want sustained pay hikes to spur higher consumption and prices.
""Wages didn't grow that much in April, so of course household spending won't rise that much,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Prices will rise a bit (on higher energy costs) but will probably run out of breath,"" Tonouchi said.
The world's third-largest economy has shown signs of life in recent months as a rebound in overseas demand helped boost its exports and output. It grew in the first quarter to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade.
But household consumption fell more than expected in April due to lower spending on cars and education, separate data showed, signaling consumer spending continues to lag behind improvement in other areas of the economy.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of total pay and determines base salaries, has been generally rising in recent months and in April grew an annual 0.4 percent, the biggest increase in three months.
Special payments, such as bonuses, in April grew 5.6 percent from a year earlier, following a revised 1.7 percent annual rise the previous month, data also showed.
Special payments are generally small, so even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, dipped 0.2 percent in April from a year earlier, following a revised 0.6 percent annual decline in March.
Desperate to stimulate growth and end decades of deflation, the Bank of Japan has embraced negative interest rates and bought up mammoth volumes of bonds.

The massive extent of the BOJ's money printing, however, has barely moved it nearer to its ultimate policy goal of lifting inflation to 2 percent, highlighting the difficulty facing the central bank as the scale of its bond buying appears unsustainable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed in May as new orders tumbled, but a jump in employment to a near two-year high pointed to sustained labor market strength despite a deceleration in job growth last month.
The moderation in services industries production, together with other data on Monday showing orders for manufactured goods falling in April for the first time in five months and worker productivity unchanged in the first quarter, suggest limited scope for faster economic growth.
""The economy is neither accelerating nor slowing, but the labor market is looking up,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell six-tenths of a percentage point to a reading of 56.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industries reported a 5.5 percentage points dive in new orders last month. Prices paid by non-manufacturing industries for materials and services declined after increasing for 13 straight months. 
But a measure of services sector employment surged 6.4 percentage points to its highest level since July 2015, suggesting labor market strength even as nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 in May after rising 174,000 in April.
The drop in prices paid by services industries could attract attention from some Federal Reserve officials when they meet on June 13-14 to deliberate on monetary policy. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points at that meeting after a similar increase in March.
GRADUAL RATE HIKES
""Most inflation comes from services rather than goods sitting on store shelves, so if services prices are in decline, the Fed has little hope of achieving its 2 percent inflation objective,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MFUG in New York. 
""We will see if this alters their gradual pace of rate hikes later on this year when they provide their latest interest rate forecasts at the upcoming meeting.""
U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. 
In a separate report on Monday, the Commerce Department said factory goods orders dropped 0.2 percent in April after jumping 1.0 percent in March. Orders rose 4.4 percent from a year ago.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a recovery in the energy sector that has led to demand for oil and gas drilling equipment.
""The slow growth narrative for the manufacturing sector and business spending outlook remains intact,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
A third report from the Labor Department showed nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, was unchanged in the last quarter. It was previously reported to have declined at a 0.6 percent annualized pace. 
Productivity has increased at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent over the last five years, below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016, indicating that the economy's potential rate of growth has declined. 
Economists blame low capital expenditure, which they say has resulted in a sharp drop in the capital-to-labor ratio, for the weakness in productivity. There are also perceptions that productivity is being inaccurately measured, especially on the information technology side.

""The result is an economy that is still stuck on a shallow growth track,"" said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho in New York.

Factory goods orders dropped 0.2 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent increase in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.2 percent in April after a previously reported 0.5 percent increase in March.
Factory orders were up 4.4 percent from a year ago.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a recovery in the energy sector that has led to demand for oil and gas drilling equipment.
But a slowdown in motor vehicle sales could hurt production in the coming months. The government reported on Friday that employment at motor vehicles and parts manufacturers fell by 1,500 jobs in May.
A manufacturing survey last week showed a measure of factory activity steady in May after two straight months of declines.
Monday's report from the Commerce Department also showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edging up 0.1 percent instead of being unchanged as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, nudged up 0.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent decrease.
In April, orders for machinery fell 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since October 2016. Mining, oilfield and gas field machinery orders fell 8.3 percent.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 2.0 percent, while orders for primary metals declined 0.7 percent.
Orders for transportation equipment fell 1.4 percent, reflecting a 9.1 percent tumble in nondefense aircraft orders. Motor vehicle orders rose 0.6 percent after falling 1.4 percent in March.
Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.2 percent, increasing for a second straight month. Manufacturing inventories gained 0.1 percent, rising for six consecutive months, while shipments were unchanged.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 06:03AM ET</span>",China May data to show stable growth as exports stay solid,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy is likely to have remained on a stable footing in May, buoyed by solid gains in trade and investment as economic ties with the United States take a positive turn and infrastructure spending cushions domestic growth.
A Reuters poll of indicators from trade and industrial output to loans and property investment, is expected to show that economic growth held up nicely into the second quarter, defying worries of a sharp slowdown. Beijing has curbed lending to avert bubbles and debt risks, but tougher regulations have raised concerns the measures could go too far and hurt growth.
Economists, however, said they felt reassured by positive signals from the top leaders of China and the United States that a trade war between the two economic power-houses was avoidable.
""We used to be worried about the negative impact of possible trade frictions on China's exports to the United States, but now that fear has eased,"" said Yan Ling, a Shenzhen-based analyst with China Merchant Securities.
""We now think it will be more about increasing U.S. imports to China.""
In sign of progress, China and the United States agreed in May to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expand trade in beef and chicken among other steps as part of Washington's drive to cut its trade deficit with Beijing.
The value of Chinese exports was seen rising 7.0 percent in May from a year earlier, and imports by 8.5 percent, slower than April's growth rates of 8.0 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. But the pace is relatively positive given declines in commodity prices and bodes well for China's trade outlook.
China's trade surplus for May was expected to rise to $46.32 billion, compared with $38.05 billion in April.
Many analysts had expected Beijing's intensifying crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a cooling property market to hit growth hard after a surprisingly optimistic first quarter. 
Indeed, growth in the world's second-largest economy was more muted in May, as fading government stimulus and financial regulatory controls have increased financing costs and weighed on profitability for firms.
China's industrial output in May is expected to rise 6.3 percent, easing slightly from 6.5 percent growth in April, while producer prices were forecast to rise 5.7 percent from a 6.4 percent gain in April.
Producer prices have been cooling since March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, pressured by fears that Chinese steel production is outweighing demand as the authorities rein in the red-hot property sector that has sparked fears of a market collapse.
Annual fixed asset investment in May likely grew 8.8 percent, moderating from 8.9 percent in April, as policymakers continued their efforts to cool the property sector, showing no intention of relaxing harsh administrative curbs that many market observers say have effectively frozen the frothy markets. 
Retail sales were expected to be stable at 10.6 percent, down from 10.7 percent in April, likely due to weaker auto sales. 
Inflation is expected to accelerate in May, with consumer prices predicted to rise 1.5 percent, a modest pick-up from April's 1.2 percent. 
However, that is still well below Beijing's official inflation target of 3 percent in 2017, suggesting policymakers still have room to tighten the screw on credit and patch holes in the financial system after years of debt-fueled stimulus. 
To be sure, while China's central bank has cautiously shifted to a tightening policy bias by raising short-term interest rates in recent months, the authorities have reiterated their support for the real economy, pledging to keep liquidity sufficient to avoid financial stress while carefully engineering reforms in its bubbly financial sector. 
Thirty-nine economists polled by Reuters predicted Chinese banks had extended 900.0 billion yuan ($132.32 billion) in new loans in May, a still-solid figure versus 1.10 trillion yuan in April.
The growth rate in outstanding loans was expected to slow to 12.8 percent in May from 12.9 percent in April. 
M2 money supply growth was also seen down a touch at 10.4 percent in May, from 10.5 percent in April, the slowest since July 2016, reflecting the moderately tighter policy stance by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
Investors will also be keen to watch if China managed to retain its grip on capital outflows in an effort to safeguard its foreign reserves that fell rapidly in 2016. 
The poll showed foreign exchange reserves edged up in May to $3.04 trillion from $3.03 trillion in April, during which a weakening in the greenback aided Beijing's efforts to contain capital outflows. 
Analysts say volatility in currency valuations could also have given the reserves figure a boost.
""The fall in the dollar was pretty big while the euro appreciated visibly against the dollar, so those changes will lead to a more bullish figure,"" said Wang Lianqing, an analyst with Industrial Securities.

But French investment bank Natixis said in a report its capital flow tracker for China shows outflows for the second quarter will rise somewhat, reversing the recovery in the first quarter.

LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain's services grew more slowly than expected last month as businesses put off investment decisions before this week's national election and higher inflation squeezed households, a survey showed on Monday.
The British economy looks as if it has recovered some of its momentum after slowing in the first three months of 2017, when the cost of the pound's fall after last year's Brexit vote caught up with consumers.
But financial data company IHS Markit, which conducted the survey, said May's weak performance by services increased the risks that quarterly growth in the overall economy might not hit its forecast of 0.5 percent.
In the first quarter, growth slowed to just 0.2 percent, the weakest rate among the Group of Seven economies, and Markit said warning signs were gathering.
""Optimism about the year ahead is running below the long-run average, weighed down principally by concerns over Brexit, political uncertainty and weaker spending by households,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
Monday's services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a three-month low of 53.8 from 55.8 the month before, at the low end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
The large size of Britain's services industry meant this decline outweighed last week's stronger-than-expected surveys for manufacturers and construction firms, dragging the all-sector index to its lowest since February as well.
Britain was one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies last year, and since then the number of people in work has risen to a record high - a fact highlighted by Prime Minister Theresa May as she campaigns for re-election.
But the opposition Labour Party has homed in on how wages are now rising more slowly than prices, after a pick-up in inflation driven largely by sterling's fall of more than 10 percent since last year's Brexit vote.
The Bank of England has shown little interest in raising interest rates to tackle what it sees as a temporary spike in inflation this year to just under 3 percent, especially as it expects growth to slow next year as Brexit nears.
The services PMI suggested inflation may be starting to ease in the sector. Average prices charged rose at the slowest pace since November, while corporate costs grew at the slowest rate in eight months, despite a pick-up in salaries.
But new orders flowed in at the slowest pace since February.
Some businesses said it was probably a temporary lull as customers delayed decisions until after the election. But others said there was heightened concern about the economic outlook as well as ""intense competition"" for new work due to squeezed consumer budgets.
The services PMI does not cover retailers, who suffered their worst quarter since 2010 in the first three months of the year, and appear to have struggled again last month after a brief respite in April.

On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.

Input cost inflation also eased to an eight-month low.
“Despite slower growth in May, the surveys indicate that the economy has regained some momentum in the second quarter,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Combined with the other PMI surveys from manufacturing and construction, Williamson said the data points to growth of 0.5% for the first quarter, although he admitted that the slowing in May provided some downside risks to the near-term outlook.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2872 from around 1.2878 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8750 from 0.8748 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 142.28 compared to 142.31 previously.

Markit's composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 57.4 from 56.7 in April.
The reading, a 73-month high, was well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction and came in a tick better than a preliminary estimate of 57.3.
The main support came from manufacturers, whose growth accelerated at the fastest pace in over six years, helped by
increased demand from both domestic and foreign clients, especially in Asia.
In services, business activity remained stable, with the final PMI reading for May at 55.4, unchanged from April and
slightly better than the flash reading published last month.
IHS Markit economist Trevor Balchin said demand from abroad for German manufacturing rose at the fastest rate in seven years in May, a sign that exports will continue to propel overall economic growth in the second quarter.
The German economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2016, the strongest rate in half a decade, helped by soaring private
consumption, higher state spending and increased construction.
In the first quarter of 2017, the economy picked up further speed as exports also helped to drive growth, pushing up
Germany's quarterly growth rate to 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.

A sister survey on Thursday showed factory activity growth cooled in May as new orders expanded at a more modest pace.
Taken together, they pushed the composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, to 52.5 in May from 51.3, its highest in seven months.
Input prices rose for a ninth consecutive month but at a slower pace than in April. Companies were able to pass on only a small part of that to customers, pointed to continued pressure on profit margins.
The pace of new hiring also rose sharply, reaching its highest level in nearly four years, after companies cut staff only four months ago.
Service providers were optimistic about growth in the year ahead, although the expectations index slipped to a three-month low.
""Business confidence fell as a reflection of firms' concerns regarding competitive pressures and lackluster demand,"" De Lima added.
India's economy grew 6.1 percent from a year earlier in the January-March quarter, unexpectedly slumping to its lowest in more than two years and stripping the country of its status as the world's fastest growing major economy.

The Reserve Bank of India is not expected to make any changes to policy on Wednesday and to leave the repo rate at 6.25 percent, despite inflation remaining below its medium-term target of 4 percent, but will strike a less hawkish tone.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Japan's services sector grows at fastest pace in almost two years in May: PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Activity in Japan's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in almost two years in May, a private survey showed on Monday, further evidence that demand in the world's third-largest economy is picking up.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 53.0 from 52.2 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The index remained above the 50 threshold, which separates expansion from contraction, for the eighth consecutive month and reached the highest level since August 2015.
""Following the 0.5 percent GDP expansion during Q1, the PMI data are suggestive of further national output expansion in the second quarter,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the index.
The index for new business rose to a four-year high of 53.5 in May from 52.2 in March, while business confidence reached its highest level since mid-2013.
The survey also showed jobs were being created at a more rapid pace, good news for policymakers who hope a tightening labor market will soon translate into higher wages and stronger consumer spending.
Services account for around two-thirds of Japan's GDP, so expansion in the sector would support overall economic growth.
A sister survey on Thursday showed manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace in three months as new orders rose.
Taken together, the composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 53.4 in May from 52.6, its highest in over three years.
Japan's economic growth in January-March is forecast to be revised up this week to a 2.4 percent annualized expansion from a preliminary 2.2 percent due to strong business investment, a Reuters survey showed.

Rising industrial output and solid exports have also shown that Japan's economy appears to be on track to expand steadily this year.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 12:55AM ET</span>",China services sector expands at fastest pace in 4 months in May: Caixin PMI,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in fourth months in May thanks to a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed, helping to offset worries about unexpected weakness in manufacturing.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.8 in May from April's 51.5, breaking a four-month decline and marking the highest reading since January. There was no breakdown by business segment in the survey.
The findings are in sync with an official survey last week which also pointed to accelerated growth and stronger demand in services. The sector accounts for more than half of China's gross domestic product.
The new orders sub-index rose to 53.5 in May from April's 53.0, signaling the strongest customer demand since December.
The 12-month business outlook among the mostly small and medium-sized services providers in the survey also rose from a five-month low in April.
That bodes well for a government that is counting on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to lessen the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment.
A similar Caixin survey last week showed the manufacturing sector unexpectedly contracted in May as demand ebbed and shrinking factory prices dented profits.
That contrasted with slow but steady growth shown in official data, but the weaker-than-expected private survey underlined investors' nervousness about the outlook for the rest of the year. Most China watchers are expecting the economy to cool in coming months after a strong first quarter, but believe the loss of momentum will be gradual.
""The improvement in the services sector bolstered the Chinese economy in May,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group in an accompanying note to the data.
""However, the rapid deterioration in the manufacturing industry is worrying.""
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, rose to 51.5 in May from 51.2 in March.
Despite stronger increases in activity and new work, however, services company raised their staffing levels only slightly in May, with the rate of job creation falling to its lowest in nine months.
China's small and medium-sized companies employ about 80 percent of the country's working population.
Profit margins also remained under pressure, with services companies only able to pass on a marginal portion of their rising input costs to consumers.
A flurry of official measures targeting financial deleveraging is expected to further squeeze financing costs and erode profits in the coming months.

Most economists expect China's quarterly economic growth to slow in the coming months from 6.9 percent in January-March. The government has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for this year.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2017 12:34PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth slows; unemployment rate drops to 4.3 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labor market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April.
Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes.""
Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force.
The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year.
Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent.
Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers.
Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
""Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. ""The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks.""
Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 185,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. U.S. financial markets are almost pricing in a 25 basis point increase in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate this month, according to CME FedWatch.
The dollar fell to seven-month lows on views the jobs data could portend diminished chances for a Fed rate hike in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks, but U.S. stocks edged up to new highs. [MKTS/GLOB].
SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK
The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year.
While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007.
As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008.
But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely.
Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives.
Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs.
Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), Macy's Inc (N:M) and Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon (O:AMZN). Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month.

Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.5% last month, in line with April’s gain but below expectations for a 2.6% rise.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created more of the new job contracts than expected in May with a total of 143,000, compared to consensus expectations for 173,000. April’s number was revised down to 173,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 194,000.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.0 last month from April’s reading of 53.1. That was its highest reading since December 2015.
Economists had expected the index to slip to 52.7 in May.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The forward-looking elements of the latest survey are reassuring for the construction sector, notably the acceleration in new business growth to its strongest so far this year,” Markit senior economist Tim Moore commented in the report.
“On the price front, while construction costs have ratcheted up over the past six to nine months, the wave of inflation from imported materials now appears to have passed its peak,” he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to have expanded more quickly in the first quarter than initially estimated, buoyed by gains in corporate capital spending, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Economic growth was seen at an annualized 2.4 percent in the first quarter, revised up from a preliminary estimate of 2.2 percent, the median forecast of 18 analysts showed.
That translates into 0.6 percent growth from the previous quarter, slightly up from the 0.5 percent gain seen in preliminary data.
The poll found capital spending was seen to rise 0.5 percent in the first quarter, up from a preliminary estimate of 0.2 percent. 
The revised data is expected to affirm an export-led recovery in Japan helped by a pickup in the global economy, although households remain cautious over spending, given sluggish wage growth. 
""Rises in capital spending suggests a positive spillover from growth in exports,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The level of consumer spending remains low but it is picking up very, very slowly.""
Analysts expect the economy to continue growing in the current quarter thanks to robust offshore demand, but risks from some Trump administration policies and in China's economy remain. 
The Cabinet Office will release GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on June 8 Japan time (2350 GMT on June 7).
Japan's April current account data is also due next week and is expected to show the surplus shrinking due in part to a narrowing trade surplus.
The poll's median forecast put Japan's April current account surplus at 1.6988 trillion yen ($15.22 billion), from 2.9 trillion yen in March.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2017 04:18PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity edges up; private payrolls surge,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity ticked up in May after slowing for two straight months and private employers stepped up hiring, suggesting the economy is regaining speed after struggling at the start of the year.
The signs of renewed vigor in the economy and labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month.
""The economy is moving forward at an acceptable pace and the Fed is likely to hike rates in June, but there is a cloud over the path of rates later on this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity ticked up to a reading of 54.9 last month from 54.8 in April. The index hit a 2-1/2-year high of 57.7 in February amid optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-business policy proposals.
It had declined for two consecutive months as concerns mounted in the business community that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda, including its push to cut corporate and individual taxes. 
A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The manufacturing recovery remains underpinned by the energy sector as steady increases in crude oil prices boost drilling activity, fueling demand for machinery.
The ISM survey's new orders sub-index increased to 59.5 last month from 57.5 in April. A measure of factory employment jumped to a reading of 53.5 from 52.0 in April. Manufacturers of food and fabricated metals products reported difficulties finding qualified workers.
Manufacturers continued to steadily increase inventories and still viewed their customers' stocks as too low, according to the survey. While raw materials prices rose for a 15th straight month, the pace of increase slowed sharply in May.
The upbeat economic data helped lift U.S. stocks, with each of the major indexes hitting record highs. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell slightly.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 253,000 jobs last month, beating economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000 jobs. Private payrolls rose by 174,000 jobs in April.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics and was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
The ADP report, however, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. According to a Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in May after a gain of 211,000 in April. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent.
ECONOMY FIRMING
Still, the ADP report added to data this week showing an acceleration in consumer spending in April. 
The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 4.0 percent pace in the second quarter.
Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, ""most participants"" believed ""it would soon be appropriate"" to raise borrowing costs.
The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. It is expected to do so again at its June 13-14 policy meeting.
In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended May 27. 
It was the 117th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
A Labor Department official said claims for California and seven other states were estimated because of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday, which could have distorted the data.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 2,500 to 238,000 last week.
""While the claims report put a damper on what has been a pretty upbeat run for most of the recent labor market data, we still have a fairly favorable view of labor market conditions,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The Fed said on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that labor markets continued to tighten from early April through late May. 
It also said ""most"" districts had cited worker shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions.

A fourth report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers surged 41 percent to 51,692 in May. Nearly 40 percent of the job cuts were announced by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), according to the report.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 27 increased by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 235,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise to 239,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended May 20 fell to 1.915 million from 1.924 million in the preceding week which was revised up from an initial reading of 1.923 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to dip to only 1.920 million.
The four-week moving average was 238,000, a rise of 2,500 from the previous week's revised reading of 235,500 (initially 235,250).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

(Reuters) - In a sign that economic growth may soften ahead, borrowing by small U.S. firms dropped to a six-month low in April, data released on Thursday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index dropped a third straight month in April to 123.1, down 5 percent from last April and the lowest level since October. 
Movements in the index typically correspond with changes in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter, though the Atlanta Fed currently projects second-quarter expansion at a brisk 3.8 percent pace.
A separate barometer of small companies' financial health suggests companies having more trouble paying off old loans. The share of loans more than 30 days past due was 1.7 percent in April, the highest rate in more than four years, PayNet data showed. 
""That's a bad cocktail: falling investment and rising loan delinquency,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder. ""It certainly is going in the wrong direction."" 
Though still well below the crisis-era peak of 4.7 percent, the rise suggests an erosion in financial health that could spell trouble for future borrowing. 
Healthcare was hit particularly hard, with borrowing falling 14 percent in April as the young Trump administration struggled to deliver on a promise to replace Obamacare with a new health insurance system.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains. 

PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

740,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 01, 2017 04:31AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI falls less than expected in May,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the U.K. decreased less than expected in May, easing concern over the British economy, industry data showed on Thursday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.7 last month from a reading of 57.3 in April.
Analysts had expected the PMI to decline to 56.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit considered the headline reading to be a further sign of “marked growth” and noted that output and new order growth remained solid, while the rate of job creations was at a 35-month high.
“The strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn,” he added.
Immediately after the report, the pound was off the day's lows, though mounting political uncertainty in Britain continued to weigh. GBP/USD was trading at 1.2875 from around 1.2874 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8718 compared to 0.8722 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 143.08 compared to 143.04 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.36%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.27%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.72%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.42%.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Manufacturing across the euro zone grew at the fastest rate in more than six years during May, increasing activity as price increases failed to slow their new orders, a survey showed on Thursday.
Signs the bloc's economy is enjoying a stable and broad-based recovery, alongside inflationary pressures, will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank.
IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.0 in May, up from April's 56.7 and its
highest level since April 2011. The figure matched a preliminary reading.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due next week, also climbed further above the 50 mark that
separates growth from contraction. It reached 58.3, its highest in more than six years high, up from April's 57.9.
""The euro zone upturn is developing deeper roots as factories enjoy a spring growth spurt,"" said Chris Williamson,
chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
""Demand for goods is growing at the steepest rate for six years, encouraging manufacturers to step up production and take
on extra staff at a rate not previously seen in the two-decade history of the PMI survey.""
A new-orders sub-index nudged up to 57.8 from 57.7, its highest since March 2011. The upturn came even though companies
raised prices last month, albeit not as sharply as they did in April.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, led the charge, but IHS Markit said solid upturns were recorded in other countries as
well. France lagged behind but is still enjoying its best quarter for six years.
As the bloc's economic performance improves, the ECB is likely to signal a move away from its ultra-easy monetary policy
by September, economists in a Reuters poll forecast last month.
However, consumer prices rose just 1.4 percent from a year ago in May, compared with 1.9 percent in April. That was weaker than the 1.5 percent expected in a Reuters poll and below the ECB's 2 percent target.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea needs to raise taxes broadly on the general population, with the affluent taxed to a greater degree, in order to pay for more jobs and welfare programs, the head of the country's presidential jobs committee said on Thursday.
""Advanced countries collect around 25 percent of GDP in taxes...this year our tax burden stands at 19.3 percent. This is completely wrong,"" said Lee Yong-sup, head of the committee, in a media briefing.
Lee said affluent South Koreans should be required to pay more taxes, although he did not specify the taxes that would be raised first. 
It was the first official hint of planned tax hikes by the administration of President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who took office on May 10.
Previous governments have grappled with tax increases but negative public sentiment and a general slowdown in the economy had made it difficult to implement higher taxes.
The government has not addressed how it will fund planned aggressive job increases in the long run - 810,000 in the public sector alone.
Thursday's press conference was also the first held by the committee to outline policy initiatives planned for the first 100 days of the Moon administration.
An additional budget, expected to be around 10 trillion won ($8.93 billion) and announced next week, is expected to be funded through robust tax revenue, rather than state borrowing via treasury bonds.
The committee said it will also look into penalizing companies that hire irregular workers 'excessively' in order to make sure more South Koreans have stable jobs.
For instance, jobs that involve the physical health and safety of workers will be required to be filled with full-time employees. Positions that do not deal with temporary tasks will also require full-time workers, the guidelines from the committee showed on Thursday.
The committee will aim to apply this standard to conglomerates first, rather than small to medium sized businesses as ""they can afford to pay more full-time workers,"" Lee said in the briefing.
""In the case of conglomerates, they have more than enough capacity to not use temporary workers but they choose to hire them because they can be fired easily or be paid less,"" said Lee.

743,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2017 10:04PM ET</span>",China May factory activity contracts for first time in nearly a year: Caixin PMI,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May for the first time in 11 months and companies shed more jobs as demand weakened and shrinking factory prices dented profits, a private survey showed on Thursday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.6, below the 50-point mark which demarcates growth and contraction on a monthly basis.
That was less than economists' forecast of 50.1 and April's 50.3, extending a streak of declines to three months since a reading of 51.7 in February. 
The findings sharply contrast with official readings on Wednesday which showed steady manufacturing growth, but the Caixin report tends to focus on smaller firms which are not believed to be benefiting as much from a construction boom as large state-owned companies and industries such as steel mills.
The divergence may suggest that much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, with other sectors facing more challenging business conditions. 
""China's manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin survey.
Demand faltered in May as total new orders fell to 50.3 - the lowest level in 11 months - from the previous month's 51.0. The rate of expansion in new export orders also weakened significantly, showing only marginal growth. 
Slower sales saw inventories of finished goods expand for the first time since December 2016, suggesting companies have stopped actively restocking, CEBM Group's Zhong said.
PRESSURE FROM PRICES
Production rose at the slowest pace since June 2016, just hovering above the no-change mark.
Adding to the pressure were falling input and output prices, which fell for the first time since June and February 2016 respectively, reflecting a decline in raw material prices and casting doubts over sustained profitability down the road. 
The survey showed Chinese manufacturers cut jobs at the fastest rate in eight months to reduce costs, with declines in staffing seen across all three main market groups.
Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), forming the bulk of the country's private investors, contribute about 60 percent of China's industrial output and create 80 percent of China's jobs. 
To be sure, the official National Bureau of Statistics survey on Tuesday showed the PMI for small enterprises reached its highest level since February 2012 at 51.0, from 50.0 in April, but their performance still lagged that of bigger firms.
Profits for private firms rose 14.3 percent in the period of Jan-April from a year ago, compared to a 58.7 percent profit rise enjoyed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), Saturday's official NBS data showed.

Despite a slowing trend in growth that has worried some market observers, Chinese manufacturers were, on balance, optimistic about the 12-month outlook for production, the survey noted, although the sentiment was unchanged from April's four-month low.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies picked up the pace of their investment in plant and equipment in January-March, highlighting a nascent return to the level of business spending needed to drive economic recovery and put a decisive end to deflation.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Thursday showed companies raised capital expenditure in January-March by 4.5 percent from the same period last year, led by spending for the production of new-model cars and investment from real estate and construction firms.
It marked a second straight quarter of annual growth in capital expenditure after posting 3.8 percent growth in the previous quarter.
Excluding software, capital expenditure grew 1.3 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, rising for three quarters in a row and following a 3.5 percent gain in the previous period, the MOF data showed.
The data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product (GDP) for the January-March period due on June 8 at 0850 JST (2350 GMT June 7). A preliminary estimate showed Japan's economy grew an annualized 2.2 percent in the first quarter on the back of rising global demand.
""The capex component of GDP will likely be revised up to around plus 0.6-1.0 percent on the quarter from the preliminary estimate of plus 0.2 percent,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute,
Overall GDP growth for the first quarter may also be revised up to an annualized rate of around 2.5 percent, although the scale of the revision will depend on inventory levels, he added.
""Companies are raising capital expenditure in part to cope with labor shortages, instead of boosting wages. But wages need to grow as well in order to spur consumer spending and help the Bank of Japan achieve a 2 percent inflation target.""
A recent run of indicators points to continued economic expansion in the current quarter, with exports and factory output rising and a labor market tightening, although wage growth and household spending remain sluggish. 
The MOF capex data showed capital expenditure by manufacturers and non-manufacturers grew 1.0 percent and 6.3 percent respectively in the first quarter from a year earlier.
Corporate profits rose 26.6 percent in January-March from a year earlier, up for a third consecutive quarter. The amount of recurring profits, at 20.1 trillion yen ($181.20 billion), was the biggest on record for a January-March quarter, driven by brisk demand for cars and smart phones, an MOF official said.
Sales rose 5.6 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, up for a second straight period, the data showed.

The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 53.1 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, stronger than a preliminary reading of 52.0 and a final 52.7 in April.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the ninth consecutive month.
The final index for new orders, which includes both domestic and overseas orders, rose to 53.4 in April, higher than both the flash reading of 51.4 and 52.4 in the previous month.
The final index for new export orders was 53.0, versus a preliminary 51.6, and a final 53.3 in the previous month.
Data on Wednesday showed Japan's industrial output grew in April at the fastest pace in almost six years, highlighting recent improvements in the economy.
Japanese manufacturers continued to create new jobs at a solid pace as orders rose and business optimism remained high, the PMI survey showed.
The government hopes an increasingly tight labour market will eventually turn around sluggish wages and weak consumer spending.
But the survey also suggested the companies continued to have trouble passing on higher input costs to buyers of their goods, squeezing profit margins and disappointing news for the Bank of Japan as inflation remains stalled well below its elusive 2 percent target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell for a second straight month in April amid a supply squeeze, but the housing market recovery remains supported by a strong labor market.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 1.3 percent to 109.8. Contracts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but surged 5.8 percent in the West.
Coming on the heels of recent data showing a drop in home building and sales of both new and previously owned homes, the decrease in contracts suggests a moderation in housing activity. Still, housing is expected to contribute to gross domestic product this year.
""We think that the housing recovery will continue over time based on favorable fundamentals in the market, but we have seen some weakening in a number of home sale measures lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""For now, we think the recent softening in sales is a pause in a broader upward trend."" 
Economists had forecast pending home sales, which become sales after a month or two, rising 0.5 percent last month. They fell 3.3 percent from a year ago. That is the first year-on-year drop since last December and the largest since June 2014.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was little changed amid a broadly weaker stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher.
Demand for housing is being driven by a tight labor market, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, which is generating wage increases and boosting employment opportunities for young Americans. The housing market remains supported by historically low mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaging 3.95 percent, the lowest level since last November.
Sales activity, however, remains constrained by tight inventories, which are driving up home prices. Housing inventory has dropped for 23 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
Home resales declined 2.3 percent in April and could decrease in May as another report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell for a third straight week last week.
""The large declines in the Northeast and Midwest suggest seasonal factors exaggerated the recent slide in pending home sales,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Mortgage applications add a note of caution, however.""

A third report showed manufacturing activity in the Midwest region accelerated to a 2-1/2-year high in May. The Chicago Purchasing Management Index rose to a reading of 59.4 this month, the highest level since November 2014, from 58.3 in April.

The jobless rate  dipped to 13.6 percent from an all-time high of 13.7 percent in the period between January and March, statistics agency IBGE said, in contrast to market expectations in a Reuters poll for an increase to 13.9 percent.
Wages discounted for inflation rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier to an average of 2,107 reais ($649.41) per month. 
""The labor market showed some early signs of stabilization,"" wrote Alberto Ramos, Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), adding that he expects a recovery to gain traction toward the end of the year unless a political crisis hurts the economy.
Brazil's jobless rate had more than doubled since hitting a record low of 6.2 percent in 2013 as the economy plunged into a deep recession. 
Data due out on Thursday is expected to show a mild recovery started in the first quarter, raising hopes of job creation and boosting President Michel Temer's case for staying in office despite accusations he received bribes from the owners of JBS SA, the world's biggest meatpacker.
Temer, who has resisted calls for his resignation, is under investigation by the Supreme Court for corruption and obstruction of justice.

The reading on the index itself decreased to 109.8 in April from the prior 111.3 (revised from an initial reading of 111.4).
Year-on-year, pending home sales fell at an annualized rate of 3.3% in April.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun said contract activity is fading this spring because significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions.
"" Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market,"" he said.
“Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it's obviously not translating to more sales,” he added.
“Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that's down 9.0% from a year ago and price appreciation that's much faster than any rise they've likely seen in their income,” Yun explained.
Unfortunately, Yun believes there is little evidence these astoundingly low supply levels are going away soon.
“Homebuilding activity has not picked up enough this year and too few homeowners are listing their home for sale,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation eased by more than expected in May, reflecting dips in Germany and Spain among others and supporting European Central Bank policymakers wanting only slow adjustments to rates and monetary stimulus.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slipped to 1.4 percent, its lowest level since December, from 1.9 percent year-on-year in April, statistis agency Eurostat said on Wednesday. This was slightly below expectations in a Reuters poll of 1.5 percent.
The inflation measure which excludes the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices also fell -- to 1.0 percent from 1.2 percent, in line with expectations.
The ECB, which meets next week, wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term and has been buying 60 billion euros ($67.1 billion) worth of bonds per month to inject more cash into the economy and drive price growth closer to its target.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that ECB policymakers were set to take a more positive view of the economy when they meet on June 8 and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed.
Having fought off the threat of deflation with years of extraordinary stimulus, the debate within the ECB is shifting to the pace of normalization, pitting doves who want incremental changes against conservatives who fear that the ECB could miss its cue, forcing more abrupt moves later.
Capital Economics European Economist Jack Allen said the May fall of inflation would not stop the ECB from changing its guidance.
IMPROVEMENTS
The inflation data comes against a background of improved economic performance.
Euro zone unemployment dropped to an eight-year low in April of 9.3 percent, Eurostat also said on Wednesday. Allen said this would in the past have implied annual wage growth rising to 2 percent or more, suggesting core inflation should pick up gradually.
Economic growth, meanwhile, is running at an annual rate of around 1.7 percent -- not particularly strong, but faster that in recent years.
ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note that the decline in euro zone inflation did provide a ""reality check"", with April driven higher by the late timing of Easter, although the ECB still faced a difficult situation with robust growth and weak price pressures.
""May's weak inflation rate suggests that the ECB is unlikely to be in any rush to change anything more than communication,"" he said.
Within the May data, energy prices increased by 4.6 percent year-on-year, Eurostat estimated, from a 7.6 percent rise in April. Unprocessed food costs were 1.6 percent higher than a year earlier, against 2.2 percent in April.
Services inflation also dropped back to 1.3 from 1.8 percent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing and services sectors expanded at a solid pace in May thanks to robust construction and infrastructure investment, welcome news for authorities trying to strike a balance between maintaining stable economic growth and defusing debt risks.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 51.2 in May, unchanged from April, a monthly survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.0.
The survey results suggest authorities were having some success in stabilizing the broader economy without risking a sharper slowdown in growth as they try to defuse bubble risks from years of credit-fueled stimulus.
On the whole, ""China's economy is changing into a trend of stabilization from a momentary spike and drop,"" Zhang Liqun, an analyst with the China Logisticas Information Centre, said in a statement.
Most analysts agree that momentum in China will slow after strong first quarter growth of 6.9 percent, as Beijing's crackdown on its financial sector is expected to take a toll on corporates' financing costs. 
So far the slowdown has been benign, however, with some key sectors such as construction activity holding up well.
The statistics bureau said construction remained robust despite slowing a notch from the previous month, as infrastructure investment speeded up, boosting demand for steel. 
Indeed, activity in the steel industry expanded the most in a year in May, supported by higher new orders, a separate industry survey showed, suggesting still-solid demand in construction.
Growth in the services sector also accelerated to 54.5 as commercial services such as retail and railway transportation expanded on rising demand. 
New orders for China's manufacturers kept pace with April at 52.3, with export orders firming a touch by 0.1 percentage point to 50.7, suggesting external demand held up.
Production stayed well within expansionary territory, though growth eased to 53.4 compared to last month's 53.8.
GROWTH RISKS
The government has set a more modest growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2017, after achieving a slightly higher 6.7 percent target in 2016. 
The crackdown on financial risks, however, is seen pushing borrowing costs up and dragging on growth.
ANZ analysts estimate the average lending rate has edged up by around 30 basis points in the past few months.
""We suspect that the current stability of growth will prove temporary,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a Singapore-based China economist at Capital Economics. 
""With the regulatory crackdown on financial risks still weighing on credit growth, it will be difficult to avoid a further slowdown in the coming months.""
There are also doubts about whether other sectors of the economy will be able to pick up the slack if the property market slows as persistent curbs gradually take the heat out of the market. 
Those worries were inflamed last week when Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years, saying it expects the financial strength of the economy will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.
China's growth impulse is also being challenged by a slowing trend in producer price inflation. Official data showed on Saturday profits earned by Chinese industrial firms slowed to its weakest in four months in April.
The input price sub-index dropped to 49.5 in May, according to the statistics bureau's May PMI survey, after easing to 51.8 in April, as the tailwind from a commodities boom weakens. 
Output prices also slipped to 47.6 from April's 48.7.
China's biggest steelmaker, Baoshan Iron & Steel (SS:600019), for instance, cut its main steel product prices for May and June after a long series of increases. 
Property sales growth also slipped in April and a strong rebound in commodity prices appears to have peaked, pointing to a continued slowdown in the industrial sector. 
On whole, however, analysts don't expect economic growth to slow sharply this year, noting the government is keen to maintain stable economic and financial conditions heading into a key political leadership reshuffle later in the year.

""In the months leading up to the 19th Party Congress in November, stability will remain the top priority for Chinese policymakers,"" said ANZ's chief China economist Raymond Yeung.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rebounded in April from March and grew at the fastest pace in almost six years, taking production to its highest level since 2008.
Japan's industrial output rose 4.0 percent in April from the previous month, the strongest growth since posting a 4.2 percent gain in June 2011, although slightly shy of the median estimate in a Reuters poll for a 4.3 percent rise.
Cars and car parts, plus equipment for making flat panel displays and semiconductors, were the fastest-growing among the 11 sectors in the 15-sector index showing growth.
The seasonally-adjusted production index for April hit 103.8, the highest level since October 2008's peak at 107.4, as robust overseas demand continued to support growth. 
""Output grew at a very high level in April. I think production will continue to grow as a trend,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The result kicked off a start to the second quarter that gives us hope for positive growth,"" Miyagawa added.
Overall inventories increased 1.5 percent in April from March, the fifth straight rising month, as stocks of cars and trucks rose.
The rise in inventory of cars may have been partly due to holidays in early May that delayed shipments, a Cabinet Office official said.
The official noted that production and inventories were not completely balanced, with companies starting to build larger inventories. 
""I don't think inventories will continue to rise at a worrying level,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to fall 2.5 percent in May on decreased output of transport equipment, fabricated metals, and iron and steel, but to rise 1.8 percent in June.

Japan's economy grew in the first quarter at the fastest rate in a year to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade, thanks to solid exports and a helpful boost from private consumption.

769,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2017 06:20PM ET</span>",Brazil's economy likely crawled out of recession in first quarter,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A record soy crop and rising automobile exports probably pulled Brazil out of its deepest recession on record in the first quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, suggesting a slow recovery gained pace before an escalating political crisis threatened to bring down the government.
Brazil's gross domestic product probably expanded by 1.0 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2016, after seasonal adjustments, according to the median forecast of 20 economists surveyed by Reuters. 
Brazil's economy has contracted in the past eight quarters. The country's deepest and longest downturn since records began in 1901 helped topple former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached for breaking budget rules. 
The economic crisis has also caused massive unemployment as GDP shrank by more than 3 percent in each of the past two years.
The numbers due out on Thursday at 9 a.m. (1200 GMT) will be a likely boost to President Michel Temer as he faces a Supreme Court investigation for corruption and obstruction of justice.
Temer, who took office a year ago, has sought to implement a broad agenda of economic reforms but faces growing calls for his resignation. 
First-quarter growth was probably driven up by bumper harvests of corn and soy. UBS economists estimate agricultural output rose 7.9 percent on a quarterly basis, outpacing other sectors of the economy by a large margin.
Meanwhile, automobile exports climbed to a record in the first quarter, driving automobile production up 24 percent. 
Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles on Monday told reporters the economy likely grew by around 0.7 percent in the first quarter versus the previous one. 
Central bank data earlier this month showed economic activity grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2016. 
The Finance Ministry expects a dip in the second quarter before growth picks up momentum in the second half of the year, as an aggressive series of interest rate cuts by the central bank starts to bolster demand. 
Gross domestic product probably slipped by 0.5 percent on an annual basis, up from a decline of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the poll. 

Estimates for the quarterly rate of growth ranged from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while estimates for the annual rate varied between an increase of 0.4 percent and a decline of 1.8 percent.

771,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2017 11:48AM ET</span>","Consumer spending, inflation data support Fed rate hike case","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is likely to remain on solid ground in the wake of other reports on Tuesday that showed confidence among households still at lofty levels despite some slippage this month and strong gains in house prices in March.
""Fed officials can continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes in June as the economy remains on course for stronger growth this quarter and throughout the rest of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March as households spent more on both goods and services.
April's increase was the biggest since December and eased concerns about second-quarter economic growth after weak reports on core capital goods orders, the goods trade deficit and inventory investment in April. Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. 
Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter, helping to restrict the increase in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year.
Following April's report and upward revisions to March's data, economists said consumer spending was running at around a 3 percent rate, a sharp acceleration from the first quarter's 0.6 percent pace. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3.8 percent.
""This takes out the downside risk to our projection for 3 percent real GDP growth this quarter, and we now see more balanced risks around that call,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower amid a drop in oil prices. The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. government bond prices rose.
TIGHTENING JOB MARKET 
Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, ""most participants"" believed ""it would soon be appropriate"" to raise borrowing costs. 
The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Consumer spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Rising house prices are also supporting consumption.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. The index, which hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March, remains underpinned by labor market strength.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, recorded its second strongest reading since 2001. 
""Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen has in the past used the labor market differential as a check on the unemployment rate, and the reading for May should provide confirmation to Yellen and her colleagues that the economy has reached the Fed's assessment of full employment,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rebounded 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. But the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the smallest gain since December 2015. 
The core PCE, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in March. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target.
""We anticipate 1.5 percent will mark the low on core PCE inflation and continue to see a move up to 2 percent next year,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month as wages jumped 0.7 percent. Savings were little changed at $759.1 billion last month.

A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased 5.9 percent year-on-year in March.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that personal spending increased 0.4% in April from the prior month, in line with expectations and the higher than March’s 0.3% gain that was revised up from a flat reading.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer inflation probably slowed more than expected in May, falling below the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent, regional data suggested on Tuesday, taking some pressure off the ECB to wind down its monetary stimulus soon.
The surprisingly weak figures from several German states hinted that price pressures in Europe's biggest economy remain relatively modest despite its continued upswing, booming labor market and the ECB's loose monetary policy.
The German data follows Spanish price figures that showed inflation in the euro zone's fourth biggest economy also eased in May. Spanish consumer prices rose by 2.0 percent on the year, their slowest rate since December, preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in April. It also fell back to 1.6 percent in Saxony. In Bavaria and Brandenburg, it dropped to 1.4 percent, while it slowed to 1.5 percent in Baden-Wuerttemberg and to 1.7 percent in Hesse.
While food costs rose more sharply, energy inflation slowed given the fall in oil prices, the data showed. Prices for leisure and package holidays also rose less sharply, as special factors related to the Easter holidays in April were reversed in May.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT.
A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested overall consumer price inflation fell to 1.6 percent in May from 2.0 percent in April.
Capital Economics analyst Jessica Hinds said the state readings suggested that German inflation fell by a little more than expected in May to some 1.5 percent. She added that underlying price pressures would remain very subdued.
""And with core inflation much lower elsewhere in the euro zone, we doubt that ECB interest rate hikes will come before 2019,"" Hinds added.
The inflation rate for the entire euro zone, due on Wednesday, is expected to have fallen to 1.5 percent in May from 1.9 percent in April, economists polled by Reuters said.
With euro zone growth on its best run since the bloc's crisis a decade ago, pressure has been mounting on the ECB to start planning an exit from its policy of aggressive bond purchases and sub-zero rates.

However, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Monday that euro zone growth may be improving but inflation remained subdued and still required substantial stimulus, tempering expectations for the central bank's June 8 policy meeting.

The European Commission's monthly survey said the overall index for the 19-country currency bloc fell to 109.2 from an upwardly revised 109.7 in April. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase to 110.0 points.
A separate business confidence indicator, which indicates the phase of the business cycle, fell to 0.90 in May from an upwardly revised 1.10 in April, against market expectations of a rise to 1.11.
The drop in sentiment was mostly driven by less optimism in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone, which dropped to 13.0 in May from 14.2 in April.
Confidence in the retail sector also dropped to 2.0 from 3.1.
But in a sign that the euro zone economy is still in a phase of healthy recovery, the manufacturing sector recorded a boost in confidence to 2.8 points from 2.6.
Inflation expectations among consumers went down to 12.8 from 13.9, in a sign of appetite for future purchases. Expectations of selling prices among manufacturers were stable.
Lower inflation would reduce pressure on the European Central Bank to quickly end its monetary stimulus.

The indicator for overall consumer confidence rose to -3.3 points in May from a downwardly revised -3.6 in April.

777,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2017 10:28PM ET</span>",Japan's tight labor market offers hope for consumer spending,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Labor demand in Japan rose to its strongest in more than 40 years while the unemployment rate held steady at a two-decade low in April, offering hope that a tight labor market will eventually spark a turnaround in weak consumer spending.
Separate data showed household spending fell more than expected in April due to lower spending on cars and education fees as consumer spending continues to lag behind improvement in other areas of the economy, such as exports and factory output.
Such a tight labor market could temper pessimism about consumer spending and bolster the Bank of Japan's argument that rising demand for workers will eventually spur inflation.
""Consumer spending looks weak now, but the labor market continues to improve,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""As more people get work, this should support consumer spending in the future.""
The jobs-to-applicants ratio rose to 1.48 in April from 1.45 in the previous month, meaning 1.48 vacancies are available for each person seeking a job. Labor demand has been rising steadily due to a shortage of workers and increased activity in services and construction.
The last time labour demand was this strong was in February 1974, when the ratio was 1.53.
The jobless rate held steady at 2.8 percent in April, matching the lowest since June 1994.
The BOJ last month maintained its projection that price growth will reach its 2 percent target in fiscal 2018 on the assumption that a tight labour market will push up wages, but not all economists are convinced.
Economists say some companies are opting to cut business hours, which makes it difficult for wages to rise.
""Some companies are scaling back the level of services they offer instead of going out and getting the workers they need,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center Co.
""This is not likely to lead to higher take-home pay.""
Japanese household spending fell 1.4 percent in April from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms, more than the median estimate for a 0.7 percent annual decline.
Excluding spending on autos and housing, household spending rose a seasonally-adjusted 3.5 percent in April from the previous month versus a 2.9 percent decline March, showing consumer spending is stronger than the headline figures, Miyazaki said.
Separate data showed retail sales rose 3.2 percent in April from a year earlier, more than the median estimate for a 2.3 percent increase, but some economists say a small sample size may exaggerate the percentage change in this data.
Under a new policy framework adopted last year, the BOJ has pledged to guide short-term interest rates to minus 0.1 percent and cap the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent.
Consumer prices rose on 0.3 percent in April from a year ago, well below the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.

However, growing signs of strength in exports and factory output have presented the BOJ with a new communications challenge, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might dial back its stimulus - even though such action remains a long way off.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel on Monday left its benchmark interest rate <ILINR=ECI> at 0.1 percent, the same level it has been for more than two years, saying the economy continues to grow at a solid pace.
All 10 economists polled by Reuters had forecast no change by the central bank, which is widely expected to hold the line on rates until the second quarter of 2018, when a hike is forecast.
In a preliminary estimate, Israel's economy grew a slower-than-expected annualised 1.4 percent in the first quarter in a period that was held back by a surge of car buying late in 2016 ahead of tax increases at the start of 2017. Economists on average had forecast a 3.7 percent increase.
The central bank acknowledged that volatility in vehicle purchases had an effect on data from the fourth quarter of 2016 -- in which the economy grew an annualised 4.7 percent -- and first quarter of 2017.
""Net of this effect, the economy has been growing strongly for approximately a year and a half, and the pace may even be higher than the long-term growth potential,"" the Bank of Israel said, noting the labor market was near full employment. ""In the first quarter, the improvement in growth of exports continued, against the background of the expansion of world trade.""
Annual inflation eased to a 0.7 percent rate in April from 0.9 percent in March, remaining below the government's target range of 1-3 percent.
The central bank said that while wages were rising, inflation in tradable goods remained negative mainly due to the continued appreciation of the shekel, which stands at a 28-month high versus the dollar <ILS=> and all-time peak against a basket of currencies.
""The increasing competition in the economy, as well as additional policy measures announced by the government --reducing purchase tax and customs on various products and lowering the cost of afterschool care -- may continue to slow the return of inflation to the target range,"" it said.
In April, the central bank estimated an inflation rate of 0.8 percent in 2017, rising to 1.5 percent in 2018. It also projects economic growth of 2.8 percent this year, down from 4 percent in 2016.
The central bank, which said there was a cooling of the housing market, reiterated that the monetary policy committee ""intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range.""

The bank stressed a divergence of monetary policy globally, saying the Federal Reserve is expected to rate U.S. rates in June while Europe and Japan continue accommodative policies.

Corporate lending in the 19-country currency bloc grew by 2.4 percent in April, just above the previous month's 2.3 percent but the highest rate since mid-2009.
While this pace of growth was less than half of the pre-crisis level, it still suggested that the ECB's cheap cash was making its way to the real economy, even if slower than the bank had originally hoped.
Lending to households meanwhile grew by 2.4 percent in April, the same level as a month earlier, when it hit its highest level since early 2009.

The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money circulating in the euro zone, which has in the past often predicted economic activity, slowed to 4.9 percent last month from 5.3 percent in March and lower than expectations for 5.2. percent in a Reuters poll.

(Reuters) - India remained the fastest growing major economy in the world last quarter, with growth buoyed by an improved performance in manufacturing and services, a Reuters poll of economists found.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ban of high-value currency notes last year had a major short-term impact on demand but private and public consumption has recovered.
The median forecast from a poll of 35 economists showed the economy grew 7.1 percent annually in the first three months of this year. Forecasts ranged from 6.5 to 7.8 percent.
Annual growth was 7.0 percent in the quarter ending December, and 7.9 percent in the January-March quarter last year.
""The demonetization drive barely impacted the economic momentum in the second half of FY'17. Most of the high-frequency indicators showed only a marginal slowdown and were quick to recover,"" said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.
India's industrial output <INIP=ECI> rose 2.7 percent in March from a year earlier, beating the median consensus of 1.5 percent growth in a Reuters poll.
Factory and services activity expanded for most of the first quarter of 2017, rising to a five-month high in March, indicating the effects from demonetization were short lived.
This acceleration in economic growth was partly driven by favorable domestic factors, including a significant improvement in the transmission of past central bank policy rate reductions into banks' lending rates, encouraging investment.
In addition, infrastructure spending is expected to support growth, as will higher agricultural output if the monsoon rains prove favorable.
The economy is also expected to benefit from the introduction of a nationwide goods and sales tax (GST), eliminating multiple state sales taxes, making it far easier to do business in India. The GST is expected to come into effect from July 1.
""The GST will boost Indian GDP at least by 100-150 basis points. It won't happen right after July 1, but probably by the end of FY18,"" said Karan Mehrishi, ‎lead economist at ‎SMERA Ratings Limited.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi Arabian central bank's foreign assets fell in April as the government borrowed heavily abroad, according to official data that suggested Riyadh was bringing money into the country to refill state coffers depleted by low oil prices.
Net foreign assets at the central bank shrank by $8.5 billion from the previous month to $492.9 billion in April, reaching their lowest level since 2011, central bank figures showed on Sunday. They fell 13.9 percent from a year earlier.
The government has been drawing down the assets, which hit a record high of $737 billion in August 2014, to cover a huge budget deficit caused by cheap oil. It has also coped with the deficit by borrowing abroad; last month it raised $9 billion with an international issue of Islamic bonds.
Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said the government appeared to have deposited much of the proceeds of the bond issue in its current account with the central bank and with Saudi commercial banks.
The current account expanded by $1.6 billion from the previous month to $11.9 billion in April, while government entities' deposits in commercial banks grew by about $3 billion. That left several billion dollars of bond proceeds whose use was not immediately clear, Malik said.
""The fact that reserves continued to fall despite the raising of $9 billion continues to imply a lot of government spending, but we aren't seeing meaningful signs of it in the Saudi economy,"" she said.
Some analysts have speculated that Riyadh may be conducting substantial amounts of off-balance sheet spending, perhaps to settle obligations abroad.
The central bank data continued to show a weak business climate in the Saudi economy, with bank lending to the private sector falling 0.3 percent from a year earlier in April.

It was only the second time in 11 years that bank lending shrank; the first time was in March this year, when it declined 0.1 percent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms rose 14.0 percent in April from a year earlier, official data showed on Saturday, slowing from March's pace and adding to concerns that the world's second-largest economy may be losing steam.
Profits in April rose to 572.78 billion yuan ($83.59 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website.
Profits had surged 23.8 percent in March over the same month of last year. For the first fourth months of the year, profits reached 2.28 trillion yuan, up 24.4 percent from the same period last year and compared with a growth of 28.3 percent in the first quarter.
After a roaring start to the year, industrial earnings had been expected to soften in April as prices of iron ore, steel and other commodities fell sharply, and as growth in factory output, investment and retail sales tapered off.
A building boom, fueled by a government infrastructure spree and a heated housing market, has boosted demand and prices for materials from steel to cement, giving China's long ailing ""smokestack"" industries more cashflow to chip away at a mountain of debt.
""Slowing growth of China's industrial profits is reasonable considering the fast growth experienced earlier this year,"" stats bureau official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data, adding that profits remained strong.
The slowdown in industrial profits can be attributed to falling prices of finished products and raw material costs, as well as slower profit growth in industries like steel, autos and chemicals, He said.
If raw material purchasing prices outpace the price of finished factory goods, this will cause industrial costs to rise, particularly for downstream industries, He said, adding that another issue that requires close monitoring is whether financing costs increase for companies.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit ratings on Wednesday for the first time in nearly 30 years, saying it expects the financial strength of the economy to erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.
After expanding by a stronger-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, China's economic growth is widely expected to cool over the rest of the year as the impact of earlier stimulus begins to fade and as borrowing costs rise in response to a crackdown on riskier forms of financing.
But, barring any major shocks, most analysts think the economy has enough momentum to hit Beijing's 6.5 percent full-year growth target.
""We are now less pessimistic about short-term growth than we were just two months ago,"" economists at Nomura said in a note on May 25.
Nomura, which is maintaining its forecast of 6.7 percent GDP growth for 2017 and 6.2 percent for 2018, still believes property investment will slow as authorities take steps to cool heated prices, but now believes the decline will be more moderate and take longer than it originally expected.
In addition, the government is expected to keep economic and financial conditions largely stable heading into a key political leadership reshuffle later this year.
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 6.7 percent year-on-year as of end-April, according to the statistics bureau.
Profits at China's state-owned firms rose 58.7 percent to 514.86 billion yuan for Jan-April, compared with a 70.5 percent rise in the first quarter.
The data includes companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

The deficit for the fiscal year that ended in March was significantly wider than the C$1.96 billion deficit the government ran in the previous fiscal year as program expenses jumped, partly due to a revamped children's benefit.
While the deficit for 2016-17 was slightly smaller than the C$23.0 billion gap the government projected in its most recent budget, final results for the year will reflect end of year adjustments that are made as data becomes available, the Finance Department said.
Taking those adjustments into account, the figures are ""broadly in line"" with the government's forecast, the department said.
The ruling Liberals ran a successful 2015 election campaign on a pledge to run deficits in order to boost spending and stimulate the economy.

For the month of March, the government ran a deficit of C$10.39 billion, wider than the C$9.44 billion it posted the year before as program expenses exceeded revenue.

784,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 12:41PM ET</span>",U.S. economy slowed less than expected in first quarter; outlook cloudier,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less than initially thought in the first quarter, but softening business investment and moderate consumer spending are clouding expectations of a sharp acceleration in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.2 percent annual rate instead of the 0.7 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate for the first three months of the year. 
That was the worst performance in a year and followed a 2.1 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter. 
""Economic indicators so far aren't entirely convincing on a second-quarter bounce in activity and show a U.S. economy struggling to surprise on the upside,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The first-quarter weakness is a blow to President Donald Trump's ambitious goal to sharply boost economic growth. 
During the 2016 presidential campaign Trump had vowed to lift annual GDP growth to 4 percent, though administration officials now see 3 percent as more realistic.
Trump has proposed a range of measures to spur faster growth, including corporate and individual tax cuts. But analysts are skeptical that fiscal stimulus, if it materializes, will fire up the economy given weak productivity and labor shortages in some areas.
""If the economy is going to grow at 3 percent for as long as the eye can see, businesses better spend lots of money on capital goods. That is not happening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The economy's sluggishness, however, is probably not a true reflection of its health, as first-quarter GDP tends to underperform because of difficulties with the calculation of data that the government is working to resolve.
The government raised its initial estimate of consumer spending growth for the first quarter, but said inventory investment was far smaller than previously reported. The trade deficit also was a bit smaller than estimated last month.
Economists had expected that GDP growth would be revised up to a 0.9 percent rate. Despite the tepid growth, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates next month. 
The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies on Friday, while U.S. stocks were flat after six straight days of gains. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose.
APRIL DATA DISAPPOINTING
Though the economy appears to have regained some speed early in the second quarter, hopes of a sharp rebound have been tempered by weak business spending, a modest increase in retail sales last month, a widening of the goods trade deficit and decreases in inventory investment.
In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, were unchanged in April for a second straight month. 
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods dipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in March. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Second-quarter GDP growth estimates range between a rate of 2.0 percent and 3.7 percent rate. 
""It looks instead that many companies may be delaying their equipment purchases for now to see if they get a better tax deal later on down the road,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The GDP report also showed an acceleration in business spending equipment was not as fast as previously estimated. Spending on equipment rose at a 7.2 percent rate in the first quarter rather than the 9.1 percent reported last month.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 0.6 percent rate instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent pace. That was still the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009 and followed the fourth quarter's robust 3.5 percent growth rate.
With consumer sentiment hovering at lofty levels, consumer spending could pick up. But there are worries that surging household debt could cut into spending as monthly repayments squeeze paychecks.
Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $4.3 billion in the last quarter, rather than the $10.3 billion reported last month. Inventory investment increased at a $49.6 billion rate in the October-December period.
Inventories subtracted 1.07 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously estimated 0.93 percentage point.
The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the first quarter, hurt by legal settlements, after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the previous three months.
Penalties imposed by the government on the U.S. subsidiaries of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities reduced financial corporate profits by $5.6 billion in the first quarter. 

In addition, a fine levied on the U.S. subsidiary of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) related to violations of U.S. environmental regulations cut $4.3 billion from non-financial corporate profits.

786,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",U.S. home prices to rise at a strong pace on tight supply: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan and Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - U.S. home prices look poised to rise at a robust pace over the next few years, mainly because of a chronic shortage of houses and steady demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Still, a slim majority of analysts in the poll taken May 16-25 said the Trump administration should pursue some form of housing market deregulation, although 60 percent were not convinced that Congress would pass such policies.
The lack of any strong consensus among analysts in this poll and the one three months ago stems from uncertainty about what kind of deregulation, if any, will be proposed. 
The administration's inability to push other promised legislation, like a healthcare overhaul, has also not helped matters.
But some respondents had strong words about any withdrawal of regulations put in place after the 2007-2008 housing market crash, which knocked property prices down by 40 percent in some areas and triggered a punishing global financial crisis. 
""Coming out of a period where we had a real housing sector collapse and where prices seemed so out of line and now having surpassed that, any housing deregulation should be done very carefully,"" said FAO Economics chief economist Robert Brusca.
Even without stimulus, U.S. home prices are likely to rise at almost double the current rate of underlying consumer prices and wages, according to the latest Reuters poll of around 40 property market analysts and economists.
After climbing 5.0 percent in each of the last two years, the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain another 5.6 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year.
This is the fifth straight quarterly Reuters poll in which analysts have bolstered their view of higher prices in 2017. 
""Healthy demand and low inventory continue to place upward pressure on home valuations,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) chief economist John Silvia. ""Those trends look to remain in place in the near term and therefore continue to underpin solid, single-digit home price increases.""
The latest data showed the number of houses for sale had dropped for 23 straight months from year-earlier periods. This pushed the median price in April to its highest since June 2016 and marked the 62nd straight month of year-on-year gains.
Turnover has not alleviated much pressure, either. In April, homebuilding dropped, new home sales plunged, and even resales fell from a more than 10-year high.
Property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter this year to average less than the 5.70-million-unit pace hit in March, which was the highest since February 2007.
Before the housing market crash, existing home sales peaked above a 7-million-unit pace in 2005.
""With the (April) supply of existing homes for sale at its lowest level since 1982, home sales will be constrained even as a strong labor market and gradual loosening in credit conditions supports housing demand,"" wrote Capital Economics property economist Matthew Pointon. 
The average 30-year mortgage rate is now forecast at 4.25 percent this year and 4.60 percent in 2018, according to the latest poll. That is below expectations from just three months ago.

When asked to rate affordability of U.S. housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. That is similar to what analysts rated British and Canadian property in separate polls. [GB/HOMES] [CA/HOMES]

The manufacturing sector is also losing a tailwind from rising producer price inflation, which helped fuel strong industrial profits but is now coming off from more than five year highs. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to come in at 51.0, which would be the lowest reading since September albeit the tenth straight month of growth, according to a median forecast of 30 economists in the Reuters poll.
In April, the PMI was 51.2, down from March when the index rose to its highest level in nearly five years.
Analysts expect overall economic growth to continue to slow for the rest of the year, as authorities tighten regulations to deter risky lending and pull back on the stimulus that helped the economy get off to an unexpectedly strong start this year. 
The world's second-largest economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom.
But growth appeared to lose steam in April, with producer price inflation falling, export growth weakening and investment and industrial output missing expectations.
Massive debt - standing at nearly 300 percent of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can't carry on pump priming, which analysts expect will eventually drag on growth during the year. 
Indeed, Moody's Investors Service lowered China's sovereign credit rating this week on expectations the financial strength of the economy will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.
Chinese officials and state media have said the debt problem is under control, and see the economy and reform efforts tracking in line with their expectations. China is targeting around 6.5 percent GDP growth this year. 
""China's economy is expected to maintain medium to fast growth this year,"" an editorial in Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily said on Friday. ""Development targets can be met and efforts will be made during the course of work to achieve even better results."" 
The official PMI number will be released on May 31, along with the official services PMI.

The private Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, will be published on June 1. The Caixin/Markit PMI is expected to come in at 50.1 for May, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down from 50.3 in April.

The poll of 20 economists found industrial production was expected to rise 4.3 percent in April from March, which would be its strongest growth since posting a gain of 6.8 percent in May 2011.
""The data is expected to confirm production activity is improving on the back of rises in exports and an inventory adjustment coming to an end,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Monthly data has fluctuated recently, so we'd better average out figures in April-June to see the trend.""
Analysts said a pickup in auto production thanks to a recovery in car sales and rising global demand for electronic components supported Japan's industrial production in April. 
The trade ministry will release factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday Japan time (2350 GMT on Tuesday). 
Respondents expected retail sales to grow 2.3 percent in April from a year earlier, up for the sixth month in a row.
Household spending was seen slipping 0.7 percent in April, down for the 14th consecutive month, but the rate of decline would slow from the previous month when it fell an annual 1.3 percent.
""Consumers remain budget-minded but auto purchases seem to have contributed to slowing down the pace of falls in household spending,"" said Hiromu Uezato, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
The poll forecast unemployment to be steady at 2.8 percent in April, staying at its lowest level in more than two decades, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio likely improved to 1.46, which would match July 1990.
The internal affairs ministry will publish the jobs data and household spending at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, and the trade ministry will announce the retail sales figures at 8:50 a.m. the same day.

796,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2017 11:46PM ET</span>","Japan consumer prices rise in April, driven by energy costs","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in April from a year earlier to mark a fourth straight month of increases, offering policymakers some hope a steady economic recovery will convince consumers to start spending again. But the increase was due largely to the fading effect of last year's energy price falls, underscoring the challenges the Bank of Japan still faces after years of heavy monetary stimulus to reach its ambitious 2 percent inflation target.
When stripping away the effect of volatile fresh food and energy costs, consumer prices were unchanged in April from a year ago in a sign many companies remain wary of hiking prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households.
""Retailers are struggling to raise prices because wages and household income aren't increasing much. They thus try to trim costs by keeping wages low,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The positive economic cycle isn't kicking in yet,"" he said, adding that the BOJ will likely maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for the time being.
With the economy showing signs of life, many analysts now expect the BOJ's next move to be a reduction - rather than an expansion - of its monetary stimulus.
But BOJ officials have stressed that any reduction in stimulus would be some time away, pointing to the fact inflation remains distant from their target.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, followed a 0.2 percent increase in March, data from the Internal Affairs Ministry showed on Friday. It was smaller than a median market forecast for a 0.4 percent gain.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, rose 0.1 percent in May from a year earlier against flat growth projected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
It was the first annual increase in the index since December 2015, thanks to the boost from rising energy prices.
""The main inflation gauges all edged up in April and should climb a bit further in coming months,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""But with the boost from higher energy prices set to fizzle out in the second half of the year, inflation will settle at levels well below the BOJ's 2 percent target.""
Thieliant added that the prices of imported consumer goods had fallen by an annual 2.43 percent in April, so even if the yen weakened to 120 versus the dollar import prices would not be severely affected.
""The upshot is that headline inflation is unlikely to rise much further from now on,"" he said.
Japan's economy grew in the first quarter at its fastest pace in a year to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade, thanks to robust exports and a helpful boost from private consumption.
Nonetheless, weak household spending and poor corporate pricing power have kept inflation around zero for almost two years, forcing the BOJ to revamp its policy framework to one better suited for a long-term battle against deflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week and the four-week moving average of claims hit a 44-year low, suggesting a further tightening of the labor market that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
The economy's brightening prospects were, however, dimmed somewhat by other data on Thursday showing the goods trade deficit widening in April and inventories decreasing, prompting analysts to pare their second-quarter GDP growth estimates.
""Businesses are wisely hoarding labor and not laying off workers because there are no skilled workers to fill these jobs at corporations and companies across the country,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended May 20, the Labor Department said. The increase followed three straight weeks of declines. 
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 238,000 in the latest week. It was the 116th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.
That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,750 to 235,250 last week, the lowest level since April 1973. 
The dollar (DXY) was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries were slightly higher. U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard and Poor's 500 index (SPX) and Nasdaq Composite index (IXIC) hitting record highs.
ROBUST JOB MARKET Labor market strength supports the view that an abrupt slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter was probably temporary. Gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the weakest performance in three years. 
Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published on Wednesday, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, ""most participants"" believed ""it would soon be appropriate"" to raise borrowing costs.
Data on the labor market, retail sales and industrial production suggest the economy regained momentum at the start of the second quarter. 
But expectations of a sharp rebound in GDP growth were tempered after the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the goods trade deficit rose 3.8 percent to $67.6 billion in April amid a drop in exports. At the same time, both wholesale and retail inventories fell 0.3 percent last month. 
Trade made no contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter while inventory investment subtracted 0.93 percentage point from output. Economists cut their second-quarter GDP estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 2.0 percent rate after the release of Thursday's data.
""If the widening in the trade gap reported thus far in the quarter is sustained, trade would subtract about half a percentage point from second-quarter GDP growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 24,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 13. 
Still, the so-called continuing claims have now held below 2 million for six straight weeks. The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped 16,000 to 1.93 million, the lowest level since January 1974. 
The continuing claims data covered the survey period for May's unemployment rate. The four-week average of continuing claims decreased 76,750 between the April and May survey weeks, indicating further improvement in the unemployment rate.

The jobless rate has dropped by four-tenths of a percentage point this year.

804,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2017 06:11AM ET</span>",UK economy slows more than expected in first quarter as inflation hits,"By David Milliken and John Geddie
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed more sharply than previously thought in early 2017 as the rise in inflation since the Brexit vote hit consumers and a weaker pound failed to boost exports, official figures showed on Thursday, two weeks before an election.
Britain was one of the world's fastest-growing major economies in 2016 as it shrugged off the initial shock of last June's vote to leave the European Union, and employment has hit a record high.
But living standards are being squeezed now as inflation rises and the economy as a whole slows. 
During the first three months of 2017, the economy expanded at its slowest rate in a year, with gross domestic product up by just 0.2 percent compared with the previous three months, Britain's Office for National Statistics said. That was weaker than an earlier estimate of 0.3 percent growth.
By contrast, Germany's economy grew by 0.6 percent and Spain's expanded by 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
Most economists polled by Reuters had forecast Britain's rate of growth would stay unchanged, which already represented a sharp slowdown from the rapid 0.7 percent pace achieved in the final three months of 2016.
Year-on-year growth in early 2017 fell to 2.0 percent from an initial estimate of 2.1 percent.
""UK GDP growth slowed ... as consumer-facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices,"" the ONS said.
Sterling weakened slightly after the data.
Some economists said they expected growth in the three months to June to strengthen slightly, reflecting an improvement in retail sales since the end of the first quarter.
""Business surveys and a strong performance on the high street suggest that there is a good chance that quarterly GDP growth will rebound in Q2,"" said Capital Economics analyst Ruth Gregory.
Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association showed consumer borrowing picked up a bit of pace last month as shoppers spent more on food over the Easter holidays.
But the BBA also said mortgage approvals, which act as a gauge of the public's economic sentiment, fell to a five-month low.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Theresa May is on track for a comfortable victory in the June 8 election. She says she wants a bigger parliamentary majority to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks which must be completed by the end of March 2019. 
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING SLOWS
After adjusting for inflation, household spending in the first quarter of 2017 rose by just 0.3 percent, its smallest increase since the final three months of 2014.
The distribution and wholesale sector -- which includes retailers -- contracted by the biggest amount since early 2010.
While business investment picked up, growing by a better-than-expected 0.6 percent on the quarter, net trade lopped 1.4 percentage points off the quarterly GDP growth rate after a strong expansion in late 2016. 
Britain's economy grew 1.8 percent last year. But that growth relied heavily on consumer spending, which this year has come under increased pressure from rising inflation as stores push up prices in response to sterling's sharp fall after the June 2016 Brexit vote.
Last month consumer price inflation reached 2.7 percent, its highest since September 2013.
The Bank of England said earlier this month that it expected first-quarter growth to be revised up to 0.4 percent, and for the economy to grow 1.9 percent this year, barely changed from 2016, as stronger investment and exports compensate for weakening household spending growth.
Most private-sector forecasters polled by Reuters see a slightly sharper slowdown.

Few expect the BoE to raise interest rates before 2019 as inflation is forecast to fall next year once the impact of sterling's weakness fades, while uncertainty during the nearly two years of Brexit talks ahead is predicted to drag on growth.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates steady on Thursday, taking an unusually bullish view of economic growth prospects as a new administration formulates multi-billion-dollar fiscal stimulus measures.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate steady at 1.25 percent as predicted by all 19 economists surveyed by Reuters.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the bank was inclined to revise up its growth outlook in coming months from the current 2.6 percent, a stronger growth trajectory than it had proposed in April.
""It is likely that we will upgrade this year's economic growth forecast in July,"" Lee told a news conference.
""Given robust exports, economic recovery, and the government's employment-oriented policy stance, wage growth is expected to accelerate in the second half,"" he added.
The BOK's base rate has been on hold at a record low 1.25 percent since a 25 basis point cut in June 2016. The bank raised its growth outlook in April for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent estimated earlier.
Lee's bullish view on the economy pushed up both the South Korean won and share prices. The currency was up 0.9 percent at 1,116.7 per dollar while the KOSPI share index extended its gains to an intraday record of 2,342.14 at midday.
Lee said he agreed with the incoming finance minister's view that fiscal policy would promote growth better than monetary policy, endorsing the new administration's planned supplementary budget to aid job creation.
During his election campaign President Moon Jae-in pledged a 10 trillion South Korean won ($8.95 billion) extra budget before the end of the year, to sit on top of a 400.5 trillion won budget for 2017 approved by parliament last year.
Market expectations for monetary policy easing have waned as exports surged for a sixth straight month through April, with inflation hovering near the central bank's target of 2 percent.
""The BOK will stay on hold through the first quarter of next year,"" said Kim Jina, fixed-income analyst at IBK Securities.
""The next policy direction will be a hike, but the bank will keep its policy easy to support growth this year and monitor the pace of interest rate tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve,"" Kim said.
Figures out this week showed household debt soared 11.1 percent in the March quarter from a year earlier, giving the central bank little inclination to set rates any lower and encourage yet more borrowing.

Lee said he saw household debt growth slowing in future, but added ""it's still too early to tell if debt growth has turned around"".

But the overall assessment of the economy was little changed from the previous meeting and there were expectations that consumer spending would rebound in coming months in light of solid economic fundamentals.

Companies signed up for $7.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, the Washington-based trade group said.
""Whether this robust activity was the result of slightly rising interest rates or reflective of sound fundamentals in the U.S. economy is yet to be determined."" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""What is known, however, is that the equipment finance business is off to a good start this year.""
ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 75.9 percent in April, up from 74.5 percent in March.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or subsidiaries of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers agreed they should hold off on raising interest rates until it was clear a recent U.S. economic slowdown was temporary, though most said a hike was coming soon, minutes from their last policy meeting showed on Wednesday.
Nearly all policymakers at the May 2-3 meeting also said they favored beginning the wind-down of the U.S. central bank's massive holdings of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities this year.
While investors continue to see a rate increase as highly likely next month, the minutes showed that the Fed's rate-setting committee ""generally"" believed it hinged on the economy rebounding from its sharp slowdown in the first quarter.
""Members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that a recent slowdown in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation,"" according to the minutes, which provided the latest indication of the Fed's heightened caution over policy tightening.
Still, Fed officials made it clear they expected the economy to pick up momentum.
U.S. stocks briefly pared gains and the U.S. dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies after the minutes were released. Yields on U.S. Treasury debt turned lower.
""They left June open. I think they would move in June, followed by a fourth-quarter hike,"" said Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income at Voya Investment Management in Atlanta.
Fed policymakers also discussed at length the reasons for the first-quarter slowdown and why a measure of underlying price gains also fell further below their 2 percent inflation target, according to the minutes.
A wider group of policymakers including officials who aren't voting on the rate-setting committee this year said they expected a rate increase would be needed soon, and reviewed a Fed staff proposal on reducing the central bank's balance sheet.
The Fed has more than $4 trillion in Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, largely accumulated as part of the effort to stimulate the economy in the wake of the 2007-2009 recession.
The staff proposal, presented as a ""possible operational approach"" to winding down the balance sheet, entails halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. 
Under the plan, a limit would be set on the amount of securities allowed to fall off the balance sheet every month. Initially, the cap would be set at a low level, but every three months the Fed would allow deeper cuts.

""Nearly all policymakers expressed a favorable view of this general approach,"" the minutes said.

809,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2017 01:27PM ET</span>",Home sales fall as tight supply boosts prices,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell from a more than 10-year high in April, weighed down by a chronic shortage of houses on the market that is keeping prices elevated and sidelining prospective buyers.
Despite the stumble, the housing market remains on solid ground as the labor market nears full employment, which is expected to spur faster wage growth.
""The biggest problem with the housing market is a dearth of inventory, which is keeping sales down and prices up,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales declined 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units last month. Sales scaled a 5.70 million-unit pace in March, which was the highest level since February 2007.
Though the drop in sales was worse than economists' expectations for a 1.1 percent decrease, April's sales pace was the fourth highest over the past 12 months. Sales were up 1.6 percent from April 2016, also underscoring the housing market's underlying strength. 
There were 1.93 million houses on the market last month. While that was a 7.2 percent increase from March, supply was down 9.0 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 23 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
As a result, the median house price jumped 6.0 percent from a year ago to $244,800 in April, the highest level since June 2016 and marking the 62nd straight month of year-on-year price gains.
The sustained house price appreciation was also corroborated by a separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices rose 6.0 percent in the first quarter from the first three months of 2016.
With recent data showing a drop in homebuilding and a plunge in new home sales in April, weak home resales suggest residential investment will probably make a small contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter. 
Housing added half a percentage point to the economy's 0.7 percent annualized growth pace in the first quarter.
U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher. The PHLX housing index (HGX) was little changed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries slipped while the dollar hovered above a 6-1/2-month low against a basket of currencies.
NEW NORMAL
Houses typically stayed on the market for 29 days last month, the shortest period since the NAR started tracking that measure in May 2011. That was down from 34 days in March and 39 days a year ago. 
Demand for housing is being driven by a tight labor market, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, which is boosting employment opportunities for young Americans. The housing market also remains supported by historically low mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate just above 4.0 percent.
But rising building material costs as well as shortages of lots and labor have left builders struggling to fill the inventory gap. Rising house prices have boosted equity for homeowners, but have not enticed many to sell their properties.
The NAR estimates housing starts and completions should be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to eliminate the shortage. Housing starts are running at about a 1.2 million-unit rate and completions around a pace of 1 million units. 
Last month, sales fell in the Northeast, West and South regions, but rose in the Midwest. At April's sales pace, it would take 4.2 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 3.8 months in March. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. First-time buyers accounted for 34 percent of transactions last month, still well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market, but up from 32 percent a year ago.

""Tight inventory, high demand and rising prices look to be with us for a while to come, and buyers should get used to this new normal,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers receded in May for the first time in nine months after hitting a decade-high level April, a Reuters survey found, showing guarded optimism in a nascent export-led economic recovery.
The Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan - showed confidence at service-sector firms hit a four-month high, a tentative sign of a pickup in domestic demand.
The Reuters Tankan follows data last week that showed the economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter at the start of this year led by exports and private consumption, although sluggish wage growth weighed on households.
In the poll of 527 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between May 9-19 in which 243 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers fell two points to 24 in May, dragged down by the food processing, precision machinery and chemicals industries.
It followed a score of 26 in April, which was the highest reading since August 2007, a year before the collapse of a U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis.
""Sentiment remained firm in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing. The dollar has risen since bottoming in mid-April and such a recovery in market conditions should underpin business sentiment,"" Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities Japan, noted in a report.
""Although indicators such as the Chinese PMI are showing weakness, machine tool orders and other data look firm, suggesting any risk of a collapse in sentiment will be limited by overseas factors.""
Nagai added that the latest survey points to further improvement in both manufacturers' and service-sector sentiment in the next BOJ tankan due out on July 3.
The Reuters Tankan's service-sector sentiment index was up two points to 30 in May, the best reading since the beginning of this year, led by retailers.
The sentiment index was seen unchanged at 24 for manufacturers in August, while the index was expected to fall to 22 for non-manufacturers.
""We feel the economy is picking up as suggested by recovery in resources prices, but capital spending at our clients is lagging behind,"" a manager at a machinery manufacturer wrote in the survey.
Import-dependent industries such as food processors complained about rising commodity prices and a weak yen that drive up import costs. Some exporters expressed concerns over uncertainty in the global economic outlook.

The Bank of Japan's last tankan out on April 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high, and service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales tumbled from near a 9-1/2-year high in April, but the housing recovery likely remains intact amid a tightening labor market. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales declined 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units last month, with sales in the West region plunging to their lowest level in nearly 1-1/2 years.
March's new home sales pace was revised up to 642,000 units, which was the highest level since October 2007.
New home sales, which are derived from building permits and account for 9.8 percent of overall home sales, are volatile on a month-to-month basis. Economists believe that unseasonably mild weather pulled forward sales into the first quarter.
""Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn't changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Economists had forecast sales decreasing 1.5 percent to a pace of 610,000 units last month from the previously reported rate of 621,000 units. Sales increased 0.5 percent on an annual basis last month. Sales for the first three months of 2017 were revised sharply higher.
Shrinking labor market slack, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, is improving employment opportunities for young Americans, underpinning demand for housing.
The housing market also continues to be supported by historically low mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovering just above 4.0 percent. Luxury homebuilder  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) on Tuesday reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly profit, boosted by an increase in home sales.
A survey last week showed homebuilder sentiment rising in May, with builders upbeat about sales over the next six months as well as current sales conditions. 
But rising costs for building materials and shortages of lots and labor have left builders struggling to meet demand, keeping house prices elevated. A report last week showed homebuilding fell for a second straight month in April, hitting its lowest level in five months.
The dollar (DXY) was trading firmer against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, while prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
U.S. stocks were modestly higher. The PHLX housing index (HGX) was little changed, with shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), falling 0.85 percent and Toll Brothers gaining 0.84 percent. 
BUILDERS CONSTRAINED
The number of new homes completed last month was unchanged, while houses under construction increased 0.6 percent. 
""Builders are running up against shortages of developed lots and having increasing difficulty finding skilled construction workers,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Sales fell in all four regions, plunging 26.3 percent in the West to their lowest level since October 2015. As a result of the drop in the West, which is considered an expensive market, the median new home price fell 3.8 percent to $309,200 in April from a year ago. 
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 268,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2009 but still less than half of what it was at its peak during the housing boom in 2006. 

At April's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in March.

LONDON (Reuters) - Businesses across the euro zone maintained April's blistering growth rate this month as firms struggled to meet growing demand, suggesting the bloc's economic momentum is sustainable at least for now, a survey showed.
Data pointing to a broad-based expansion alongside rising price pressures and a record level for Ifo's German business morale index will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank.
IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for May, seen as a good guide to growth, matched the previous month's 56.8, its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
That confounded the median expectation in a Reuters poll for a dip to 56.6.
IHS Markit said the PMI pointed to second quarter GDP growth of 0.7 percent, much faster than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last week. Official flash data said the bloc's economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter. [ECILT/EU]
""The strength of both the euro zone composite PMI and the German Ifo in May provide further evidence that the economic recovery gained pace in Q2,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
Activity in the French private sector surged to a six-year high in May as growth in the dominant service sector accelerated and the election of President Emmanuel Macron lifted business optimism, a sister survey showed.
Germany's private sector grew at the fastest pace in more than six years, and Ifo said business morale brightened more than expected, suggesting Europe's biggest economy will carry its robust upswing into the second quarter.
Its economy picked up steam in the first quarter helped by strong exports, booming construction and higher household and state spending, official data showed earlier on Tuesday.
Growth was 0.6 percent quarter on quarter, up from 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year.
""Today's strong German data add to the evidence that, not only the German economy, but the entire euro zone economy could become the positive growth surprise of 2017,"" said Carsten Brzeski at ING.
However, the relative strength of the German and French composite PMIs compared with the static euro zone reading suggests growth has slowed in other countries across the region.
""As much as the pessimism at the start of the year was exaggerated, the current euphoria is as well. Be aware of the sugar rush,"" Brzeski said.
The euro set a new six-month month high on Tuesday and the region's shares made gains as the latest economic data made for some encouraging reading, especially in Germany. [MKTS/GLOB]
BACKLOGS BACK-UP
Buoyant demand meant firms across the bloc built up backlogs of work at the second fastest rate in over six years. The sub-index rose to 53.3 from 53.0.
Factories across the currency union had a much better May than predicted. A Reuters poll said the manufacturing PMI would fall to 56.5 but it instead climbed to 57.0 from 56.7, its highest since April 2011.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 58.4 from 57.9, also the highest since April 2011.
Demonstrating their confidence about the months ahead, factories increased headcount at the fastest rate in the 20-year history of the survey. The employment index was 56.2, up from April's 55.5 and overall employment gains were the second best in a decade.
""It's by no means suggesting you are going to see any serious slowdown from here,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Growth in the bloc's dominant service industry decelerated slightly this month, its PMI showed, dipping to 56.2 from 56.4 and missing forecasts in a Reuters poll for no change.

But last month's final reading was the highest since April 2011. Chances are strong growth will continue -- the business expectations index bounced to 68.1 from 67.2, its highest since early 2011.

822,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",UK budget deficit widens more than expected as VAT revenues stall,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's budget deficit widened by more than expected at the start of the new financial year as value-added tax revenues flat-lined, reflecting the strain on consumers from rising inflation after the Brexit vote.
The deficit in April stood at 10.4 billion pounds in April, up 13.1 percent compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics said, citing figures that exclude state-controlled banks.
The figure was higher than all forecasts from economists who were polled by Reuters. The median forecast in the poll was for a deficit of 8.9 billion pounds.
Britain has been struggling to fix its public finances since the budget deficit surged to around 10 percent gross domestic product in 2010 after the global financial crisis.
Since then it has fallen steadily to 2.5 percent of GDP in the 2016/17 financial year which ended in March, its smallest since before the global financial crisis.
The ONS said on Tuesday it had revised last year's shortfall down by 3.3 billion pounds to 48.7 billion pounds.
The deficit is expected to widen again in 2017/18 when finance minister Philip Hammond will have fewer one-off factors to help him than last year.
Hammond might also come under pressure if Britain's economy slows more sharply than expected this year. Official figures due on Thursday are expected to confirm that the pace of growth more than halved in first three months of 2017 as consumers reined in their spending in the face of higher inflation.
The ONS said value-added tax revenues grew by only 0.2 percent in annual terms in April, the slowest year-on-year increase since August last year, when Britain's economy was still reeling from the shock of the Brexit referendum.
Income tax revenues rose by just over 1 percent.
However, corporation tax revenues rose by 7 percent in April compared with the same month last year.
The two main political parties contesting the June 8 national election have adopted contrasting stances on how to run the public finances.
Prime Minister Theresa May said last week her Conservative Party would aim to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s.
Previously, her finance minister Philip Hammond had said he wanted to get rid of the shortfall as soon as possible after the 2021/22 financial year. Britain's official budget watchdog has said that would probably take until 2025/26.
By contrast, the opposition Labour Party wants to eliminate the government's deficit only in day-to-day spending within five years and would exclude investment in infrastructure from its cost-cutting.
Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, has said Labour's plans suggested the overall deficit could rise to about 4 percent of gross domestic product by 2021/22 compared with the Conservatives' aim of cutting it to 0.7 percent of GDP by then.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain's office fiscal watchdog, has estimated it is due to rise to 2.9 percent in the current year before resuming its fall.
Looking further ahead, whoever wins the June 8 election faces the challenge of how to pay for the rising costs of Britain's aging population.
May last week said she wanted to reduce one growing strain on the public finances by shifting a greater share of the cost of caring for elderly people from taxpayers to homeowners. On Monday, she softened the plan by saying she would make sure there was a limit on the amount people would have to spend.

May has chosen not to repeat the promises made by her predecessor David Cameron not to raise income tax or national insurance contributions.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy picked up steam in the first quarter helped by strong exports, booming construction and higher household and state spending, burnishing Chancellor Angela Merkel's economic credentials as she gears up for national elections.
Europe's biggest economy grew 0.6 percent quarter on quarter, up from 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, confirming a preliminary reading.
The final figures, continuing a run of solid economic data, show a broad-based upswing - good news for Merkel as she prepares to seek a fourth term in office on Sept. 24.
A poll published on Tuesday showed her conservative CDU/CSU bloc - which has been widening its lead over its Social Democrat rivals - and the pro-business Free Democrats winning enough seats to form a parliamentary majority together.
""The economic upswing has become more broad-based,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said. ""Hopes are growing that this will become a self-reinforcing boom.""
The Statistics Office said exports rose 1.3 percent and imports edged up 0.4 percent, meaning net trade added 0.4 percentage points to gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
Investment in construction jumped 2.3 percent, the strongest increase in three years. A growing population, increased job security and record-low interest rates are fuelling a property boom in Europe's biggest economy.
Investment in machinery and equipment rose 1.2 percent, in a sign that companies are looking to expand despite political risks clouding the growth outlook.
German consumers are meanwhile benefiting from record-high employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs, with rising household spending adding 0.2 percentage points to growth.
State spending rose 0.4 percent, German authorities are spending billions of euros on accommodating and integrating more than one million refugees who have arrived since the start of 2015, many from war zones such as Syria and Iraq.
A change in inventories subtracted 0.4 percentage points from the overall GDP growth rate, the data showed.
""Even in its ninth year, the recovery is still going strongly. In fact, the recovery has broadened across all sectors,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, adding that there were no signs that momentum might be lost any time soon.
While Germany's vibrant domestic economy was reflected in strong construction activity and continued strength in private consumption, private investments finally started to pick up too, he noted.
Even though the German government was trying to counter international criticism of a lack of investment, the discussion on how to further strengthen investments, particularly private sector investments, would clearly continue, he added.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary reading of its monthly purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 57.6 this month from 56.6, reaching the highest level since May 2011.
The reading lifted the index further away from the 50-point threshold dividing contraction from expansion in activity. It also beat economists' average forecast of 56.7 and the highest estimate in a Reuters poll, which was for 57.5.
""Overall this is a really encouraging picture of the current health of the French economy,"" IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
A breakdown of the survey results showed that index for France's dominant services sector rose to 58.0 from 56.7, beating expectations for 56.5.
Manufacturing saw its index drop slightly however, falling to 54.0 from 55.1, undershooting expectations for a slight increase to 55.2.
""I wouldn't worry too much about the drop in manufacturing,"" Williamson said. ""That pulled back possibly because of signs the stronger euro may be denting firms' expectations of what they might be able to achieve in export growth over the year ahead.""
In a good sign for unemployment, which remains high at 9.6 percent, French companies continued to increase staffing numbers in May, a trend that has been evident since November last year.
Firms also raised prices for the second consecutive month, which Williamson said was a sign they were now confident demand was strong enough to pass on rising costs to their clients.
French companies' optimism about output growth over the next 12 months also rose to 69.7, the highest level since IHS Markit started measuring it in 2012.
""That's a great sign that companies are pleased with the election result and looking forward to stronger growth ahead,"" Williamson said.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 52.0 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, from a final 52.7 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the ninth consecutive month but indicated that growth was the slowest since November.
The flash index for new export orders fell to 51.6 from a final 53.3 in the previous month, which also marked the slowest growth since November.

Brazilian consumer prices likely rose just 3.74 percent in the 12 months through mid-May, the slowest pace of inflation since July 2007, according to the median forecast of 24 economists. <BRIPCY=ECI>
The mid-May inflation figures will be released at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) on Tuesday by the national statistics agency IBGE.
Prices are expected to show a rise of 0.21 percent from mid-April, the same monthly inflation rate as in the previous reading, according to the median of 26 forecasts.
Inflation has stalled after hitting a 12-year peak of 10.7 percent in January 2016 as the worst recession in Brazil's history caused widespread unemployment and weak consumer demand.
Consumer price inflation is now below the government's target of 4.5 percent for the first time since 2010.
As inflation eases, the central bank is widely expected to cut the key Selic interest rate from its current 11.25 percent, even as a major corruption scandal last week put President Michel Temer's administration on the verge of collapse.
The central bank in April slashed rates by 100 basis points, the deepest rate cut in nearly eight years and the fifth meeting in a row to produce a reduction. Rate cuts are seen as fundamental for the economy to crawl out of recession this year.

The country's gross domestic product grew at a rate of 0.7 percent, the same pace as in the fourth quarter, according to seasonally adjusted data from national statistics agency INEGI on Monday.
The election of Donald Trump last year raised the specter of recession in Mexico as he threatened to shred the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and pursue policies that could hurt the Mexican economy. This sent the country's peso into a tailspin and prompted some economists to lower growth forecasts.
Nonetheless, slow progress in starting NAFTA talks and an overall softening of rhetoric about U.S. companies that invest in Mexico have calmed nerves for now.
Compared with the first quarter of 2016, GDP expanded 2.8 percent.
Growth was higher than preliminary figures released last month, which projected quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.6 percent. The preliminary data showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 2.7 percent for the quarter.
Mexico's government has put 2017 growth between 1.3 and 2.3 percent, and officials said last month the range remained unchanged for now, but would be looked at again after Monday's publication of final GDP figures.

U.S. customers bought goods from Europe's biggest economy worth 29.1 billion euros ($32.5 billion), keeping the U.S. as the biggest client for 'Made in Germany' products, Federal Statistics Office figures reviewed by Reuters showed.
Since German clients imported much less U.S. goods from January-March, Germany's trade surplus with the United States swelled to nearly 14 billion euros in the first quarter. This is the biggest bilateral surplus with a single country for Germany.
Germany's export strength, the U.S. trade deficit and measures to protect producers with import tariffs will rank high on the agenda during talks between Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries and U.S. counterparts such as Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer in Washington this week.
Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20 group of the world's biggest developed and developing countries, advocates an order of free and open trade based on the jointly agreed rules by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Trump's protectionist rhetoric and the dispute about the benefits of free trade are likely to also dominate the agenda of the G20 summit to be held in Hamburg in July - even though initial concerns among German politicians and business managers in Europe's economic powerhouse have eased.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose in April to mark their fifth straight month of gains, as shipments of semiconductors and steel expanded, signaling that more robust overseas demand could underpin a steady economic recovery.
Exports rose 7.5 percent in April from a year ago, below the median estimate of 7.8 percent annual growth, finance ministry data showed on Monday. It followed a 12.0 percent rise in March.
The data also showed Japan's trade surplus with the United States narrowed. Exports to the United States increased 2.6 percent in April from a year ago, gaining for the third straight month due to larger shipments of cars and auto parts. But Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 4.2 percent in April from a year ago to 586.7 billion yen ($5.27 billion).
Japan's exports are expected to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum, but concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges to adopt protectionist trade policies cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
""Japan's exports will continue growing, and imports will probably also rise as domestic production picks up,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
The drop in Japan's trade surplus with the United States, however, could take some pressure off Japan as it makes it more difficult for Trump to justify criticizing Japan for its trade practices.
Japan's economy grew in the first quarter at the fastest rate in a year to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade, thanks to solid exports and a helpful boost from private consumption.
In terms of volume, exports rose 4.1 percent in April from a year ago, the third consecutive month of gains, another sign of overseas demand picking up.
Exports to China rose 14.8 percent on-year in April, the sixth straight month of gains, boosted by shipments of optical equipment, auto parts and steel.
Japan's exports to Asia rose 12.2 percent on-year in April, also posting the sixth straight month of gains on increased shipments of semiconductors.
Imports surged 15.1 percent versus the median estimate for a 14.8 percent increase, rising for the fourth straight month on rising energy costs.
The overall trade balance came to a surplus of 481.7 billion yen ($4.33 billion), versus the median estimate for a 521 billion yen surplus.

835,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2017 05:03PM ET</span>","In surprise move, Egypt central bank hikes key interest rates","By Eric Knecht
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points on Sunday, citing stronger economic growth and falling unemployment, confounding the expectations of economists who forecast rates were unlikely to change.
At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the bank hiked its overnight deposit rate to 16.75 percent from 14.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 17.75 from 15.75 percent, it announced in a statement.
This was the bank's first increase in rates since an aggressive hiked of 300 basis points in November.
Egypt floated its currency in November and it has roughly halved in value since then. The move helped it clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program tied to ambitious reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts.
The IMF has said lowering inflation is key to keeping its economic reform program on track and said as recently as last week that raising key interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so.
Inflation has soared to a three-decade high since the currency float, with annual urban inflation reaching 31.5 percent in April.
The bank said ""its tighter stance is not to offset effects of supply-shocks"" but instead is intended to curb ""inflation expectations and the build-up of demand-side pressures,"" a possible reference to the impact of the currency float.
Some economists, however, have argued that price rises related to one-off shocks such as the currency float can not be corrected by higher interest rates, which they say may simply sap economic growth by reducing new investment.
""We believe that a hike in the CBE corridor interest rates might not be the appropriate tool to curb inflation and would render investment irrational at such high cost of debt rates,"" said a research note from Arqaam Capital.

Economists polled by Reuters last week overwhelmingly expected rates to remain unchanged, with 13 of 14 economists predicting them to stay put amid lower lending growth in recent quarters.

The annual survey, which was conducted in October 2016, is now in its fourth year and acts as a temperature check on the financial wellbeing of U.S. families.
Seventy percent of those surveyed said that they were either ""living comfortably"" or ""doing okay,"" an improvement from 69 percent the prior year and 62 percent in 2013.
The improving statistics in part reflect a buoyant jobs market. Since the last survey the unemployment rate has declined to 4.4 percent from 5.0 percent, and is now near what many economists would consider full employment.
U.S. stocks have risen as well as home prices, both of which can also contribute to household wealth. However, that masks deep disparities and wage growth has remained sluggish even though the economy has largely recovered from the financial crisis.
Forty percent of respondents with a high school degree or less said they were struggling financially, one percentage point more than in 2015, at a time when those with more education felt their situation had improved. Seventeen percent of those with a college education described themselves the same way.
There were also differences based on race and ethnicity. Fifty-one percent of white adults said they felt better off than their parents compared to 60 percent of black adults and 56 percent of Hispanic respondents.
Former manufacturing towns helped propel President Donald Trump to the White House last November and there have been growing concerns over the lack of well-paying jobs for those without a college degree.
""The survey findings remind us that many American households are struggling financially, including fully 40 percent of those with a high school diploma or less,"" Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
Elsewhere, the survey showed that improved incomes did not necessarily mean large savings or job stability.
Forty-four percent of respondents said they would struggle to meet emergency expenses of $400, a drop of 2 percentage points from 2015, while 17 percent of workers, and 24 percent with a high-school education of less, said their work schedule was changed by their employer from week to week.
Within that, two-thirds received their schedule six days or less in advance and 37 percent had either on-call scheduling or received notice one day or less in advance, the Fed said. 
The survey tallied the responses of 6,643 adults aged 18 and over.

LONDON (Reuters) - Visits to Britain by North Americans surged at the start of this year as tourists took advantage of the weakened pound, which may be forcing British holidaymakers to stay closer to home, official data showed on Friday.
Some 8.1 million people visited Britain in the first quarter of this year, up from 7.6 million in the same quarter a year ago - a 7 percent increase, the Office for National Statistics said.
""The (data) indicate that the sharply weakened pound is encouraging more visits to the UK from abroad and more spend by visitors,"" Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said.
""This is especially true of North America, which ties in with the pound's fall being most pronounced against the U.S. dollar.""
The pound tumbled against the U.S. dollar after the June 23 vote to leave the European Union, instantly making Britain a cheaper place to visit. As of the first quarter of 2017, it was still down around 17 percent against the American currency. 
The number of North American tourists visiting Britain totaled 760,000 in the three months to March, up 17 percent compared with a year ago.
But on the flip-side of the pound's plunge, the number of Britons making the trip to North America fell 3 percent over the same period to 710,000. 
There was a 2 percent increase in the number of British visitors to Europe, suggesting the pound's fall may be forcing British people to holiday closer to home and chiming with reports of a rise in ""staycationing"" in Britain.
Visitors to Britain from other European countries increased 4 percent compared with a year ago, rising to 6.2 million.
Domestic and foreign tourism accounts directly for about 4 percent of Britain's economy, according to official statistics, though the industry says the broader contribution is larger.
Britain's economy has outperformed most forecasters' expectations since the vote to leave the European Union, which sent the pound to a record low against a basket of currencies.
This has already produced a sharp rise in inflation, but there has also been evidence of a modest boost to exports and inbound tourism.

A survey of manufacturers on Friday showed export orders are growing at the joint-fastest pace since December, 2013.

The poll also showed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) core inflation measure likely increased 1.3 percent from a year earlier in April, compared with 1.2 percent in March month.
The main driver for higher core inflation was a rise in electricity tariffs,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Michael Wan said. 
""Besides that, most of the factors were a continuation from the previous month's trend,"" he said.
""I don't think we are going to get very big surprises on the inflation side,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. 
""A lot of the administrative price hikes, like the water price hike haven't really kicked in and would only probably kick in third quarter onwards.""
The government in February announced a two-step, 30 percent increase in water prices, the first water prices increase in nearly two decades.
On the whole, the CPI numbers aren't likely to shift the central bank's neutral policy stance.
The MAS held policy steady in April, saying a ""neutral"" stance will be needed for an extended period as it looked to support an economy that contracted in the first quarter amid lingering risks to the global outlook.

The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation, which are influenced more by government policies.

The median estimate by the 11 economists polled put gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 2.7 percent in the January-March quarter from a year earlier.
That would be better than the official advance estimate of 2.5 percent growth released last month.
On a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis GDP probably contracted by 1 percent in the January-March quarter, the poll showed, compared to the advance estimate of a 1.9 percent contraction.
Singapore's manufacturing output beat expectations in March, ring 10.2 percent from a year earlier, making analysts revise upwards their first quarter GDP forecasts, but weak export numbers in April cast a shadow on the outlook. 
""We're on watch mode,"" said Mizuho Bank senior economist, Vishnu Varathan, adding that he is not revising his full year GDP forecast. 
""We did see export numbers feeding into the story of moderation for the rest of the year. Q1 is not compelling enough for us to suggest suddenly the prospects are a lot more upbeat.""
Other analysts doubt that the better than expected growth of the last two quarters can be sustained. 
""We reckon that it will be challenging for the recent strength in exports and production to sustain in the second half of 2017,"" said ANZ economist Weiwen Ng.
He said Singapore could face headwinds due to its reliance on growth that was mostly driven by the electronics sector and by trade with China. 
""We know that this recovery is externally driven by exports. The tech cycle is maturing and we saw that in the modest moderation in the electronic exports (in April),"" Ng said.
""Exports are geographically and narrowly driven by China.""

Singapore's non-oil domestic exports to China grew much slower in April at 10.9 percent from a year earlier, compared to 45.5 percent growth in March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports were expected to rise for a fifth straight month in April, a Reuters poll found on Friday, supported by global demand especially from Asia and affirming the outlook for an export-led recovery.
Although the rate of export growth was seen likely to slow last month after robust rises in March, analysts see a global economic upturn continuing to support Japanese trade.Exports were seen likely to have grown 7.8 percent in April from a year ago after jumping 12.0 percent in March, the biggest gain in more than two years.
Imports were expected to increase 14.8 percent last month from a year earlier taking the trade surplus to 520.7 billion yen ($4.69 billion).
""Demand for items such as electronic parts and devices boosted overall exports thanks to the global recovery in the IT cycle,"" said Akihiro Morishige, senior economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
""External demand will likely continue to pick up, which will support Japan's exports this year.""
The finance ministry will publish the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday (2350 GMT Sunday).
Inflation data is also due next week, with core consumer prices expected to have accelerated last month, led by energy costs.
Prices of other items remained weak, analysts say, suggesting there is some way to go before the Bank of Japan's 2 percent price growth target is reached.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, likely rose 0.4 percent in April from a year earlier, up for a fourth straight month, the poll found. 
""Energy prices largely pushed up core CPI and the prices of other items continued to stagnate,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute.
""There is a high chance that core CPI gradually accelerates towards autumn this year.""
The poll found core CPI in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, was flat in May after a 0.1 percent fall in April.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy grew at a better-than-expected 5.6 percent the first quarter, easily beating expectations, as buoyant exports and solid domestic demand produced the fastest growth in two years. 
January-March growth, announced by the central bank on Friday, was well above a Reuters poll forecast of 4.8 percent and the previous quarter's 4.5 percent expansion.
""We expect growth to be sustained,"" Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Governor Muhammad Ibrahim told at a news conference.
He said the central bank was keeping its full-year growth forecast at 4.3-4.8 percent. In the first quarter, he said, it saw ""strong growth in private investments and exports"".
March exports surged 24.1 percent from a year earlier in ringgitterms, and those in February 26.5 percent.
But the current account surplus, which has generally been decreasing, narrowed in the first quarter to 5.3 billion ringgit from 12.5 billion ringgit in 2016's last period, due to lower goods surplus and larger services deficit.
""A recovery in commodity prices should help bolster the current account surplus in the coming quarters, though the surplus is still likely to remain low by past standards,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Portfolio investments saw a big net outflow of 31.9 billion ringgit, compared to a 19.1 billion outflow in the fourth quarter.
Capital outflows hit a record in November-January, when foreign investors divested holdings of government bonds to the tune of 27.9 billion ringgit ($6.46 billion).
In early 2016, tepid demand for Malaysia's oil and other commodity exports pulled full-year growth down to 4.2 percent, the lowest since contraction in 2009, from 5.0 percent in 2015. 
STRONGER RINGGIT
The ringgit, one of the region's worst performing currencies, in 2016, hit a 19-year low of 4.9880 on Jan. 4 but so far this year has strengthened about 3.7 percent against the dollar.
The BNM governor said that stability measures have reduced volatility in the ringgit and the domestic forex market.
""We think the ringgit will further reflect the strength of the Malaysian economy,"" Muhammad said.
The central bank has said inflation averaged at 4.3 percent in Q1.
Annual consumer price inflation hit an eight-year high in March at 5.1 percent, though it slowed to 4.4 percent in April.
""The spike (in inflation) was largely due to higher oil prices. We still expect inflation to come in at 3-4 percent. Again, there is some uncertainty in global markets, but what is important is its cost driven and not due to demand,"" Muhammad told reporters.
Rising living costs could eat into support for Malaysia's long-ruling political coalition led by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is widely expected to call for early polls later this year to take advantage of a weak and divided opposition.

Najib, whose popularity took a hit from a corruption scandal involving state-owned fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), also needs a strong economy to bolster his electoral chances.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week and the number of Americans on unemployment rolls tumbled to a 28-1/2-year low, pointing to rapidly shrinking labor market slack.
The economy's brightening prospects were further boosted by other data on Thursday showing a sharp acceleration in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in May as manufacturers reported a jump in goods shipments and more hours for workers. In addition, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity rose again in April.
The raft of upbeat economic data supports an interest rate hike next month, though the Federal Reserve's decision could also hinge on the state of financial markets, which have been rattled in recent days by President Donald Trump's scandals. 
The cloud over Trump, stemming from his firing last week of the FBI chief and reports that the U.S. leader disclosed national security information to Russian officials, is seen as a threat to an ambitious economic agenda that includes tax cuts.
""Based on ... how the U.S. political system works, President Trump was never going to be able to legislate as boldly, and unilaterally, as some rhetoric suggested,"" said James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. ""Global growth is picking up in the background and everything suggests that the Fed will stick to its hiking plan,"" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended May 13, declining for three consecutive weeks, the Labor Department said. That pushed claims close to levels last seen in 1973. 
Economists had forecast claims rising to 240,000 last week. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 115 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 22,000 to 1.90 million in the week ended May 6, the lowest level since November 1988. 
Last week's claims data covered the survey week for May's nonfarm payrolls. Claims fell 11,000 between the April and May survey periods suggesting further employment gains this month. The economy created 211,000 jobs in April.
RATE HIKE ODDS FALL
Labor market strength could allow the Fed to raise rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in March and has signaled two more rate hikes for 2017.
Expectations of further monetary policy tightening have also been underpinned by data on inflation, retail sales and industrial production which suggested economic growth picked up early in the second quarter. The economy grew at an anemic 0.7 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. 
But a stock market sell-off, if sustained, amid uncertainty over Trump's political future could jeopardize further rate increases.
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 69 percent chance of a 25-basis-point hike at the Fed's June meeting, down from 78.5 percent on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
The U.S. dollar was flat against a basket of currencies on Thursday, while prices for longer-maturity U.S. Treasuries were modestly higher. Stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher after Wednesday's sell-off.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Fed said its index for current manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region jumped to a reading of 38.8 this month from 22.0 in April, recovering some of the declines of the previous two months.
It was buoyed by a surge in the shipments sub-index. While a gauge of new orders received by factories slipped, unfilled orders increased. Also pointing to further momentum in factory activity in the region, a measure of inventories dropped to a reading of 1.4 from 17.8 in April.
Though the employment index fell three points, factories increased hours for workers. 
""The details were ... consistent with the recent pickup in manufacturing output in the industrial production report being sustained,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

In a third report, the Conference Board said its leading economic index rose 0.3 percent in April after a similar gain in March.

Foreign investment into China slowed in April, falling 4.3 percent from a year earlier to 59.91 billion yuan, compared to 6.7 percent growth in March. In the first three months of the year, foreign investment rose 1 percent.
The Chinese government has promised new measures to further open its economy to foreign investors this year, including easing limits on investment in banks and other financial institutions.
Foreign investment into China last year rose 4.1 percent but was less than outbound investment for the first time as capital outflows put pressure on the government to support the yuan.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the first quarter on weaker government spending, but strong exports and domestic consumption suggest the Southeast Asian country remains poised to raise rates this year.
It was the slowest economic expansion since firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte took office nearly a year ago, sending Manila's equities (PSI) down more than 1 percent and the peso <PHP=> to a one-week low.
Gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent in January-March from a year earlier, below forecasts for 6.8 percent growth and the slowest since the last quarter of 2015.
The Philippine Statistics Authority revised growth in October-December 2015 to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent.
But the Philippines remains one of the fastest growing economies in Asia with robust consumption, which fueled last year's growth, continuing to bolster economic activity as exports pick up.
""Moving forward, the domestic economy is poised to maintain its growth momentum with the recovery of external trade and the private sector's steadfast optimism,"" Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said, adding growth was broadly in line with the 6.5-7.5 pct target for this year.
Pernia said the slowdown could be explained by the absence of election spending, which boosted growth a year earlier.
RATE HIKE SEEN
Strong exports and consumer spending, however, should put the central bank on course to raise interest rates this year, economists said.
""With robust growth and rising inflation, the space for the central bank to maintain its policy stance is closing,"" said ANZ economist Eugenia Victorino who expects a 50-basis-point hike in rates this year.
Exports grew 20.3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier and domestic consumption rose 5.7 percent. But government consumption growth eased to 0.2 percent from 4.5 percent in the previous quarter and 11.8 percent a year ago in the absence of election spending.
""Given the government's aggressive fiscal plan this year, it remains to be seen if spending may accelerate going forward, which will definitely be a big boost to GDP growth momentum,"" said Gundy Cahyadi, economist at DBS Bank. Cahyadi expects full-year growth to come in at 6.4 percent.
The economy grew a seasonally adjusted 1.1 percent from the previous three months, also less than the 1.5 percent forecast in a Reuters poll and the slowest in eight quarters.
To sustain the economy's growth momentum and ensure its effects are more broadly felt, Duterte has promised to spend up to $180 billion over six years to build and modernize railways, airports, seaports and roads.

The stimulus would help offset the impact of protectionist U.S. policies on remittances from overseas Filipinos and on American investment in business process outsourcing to the Philippines, a vital sector for the economy.

857,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2017 02:44AM ET</span>",China home prices pick up pace in April despite curbs,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices in China rose 0.7 percent in April, barely faster than the 0.6 percent increase in March, following tougher curbs aimed at driving speculators out of what had been a red hot market.
Compared with a year ago, new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 10.7 percent in April, moderating from 11.3 percent in March, according to Reuters calculations based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday.
Analysts say accelerated prices gains were likely supported by increased demand in smaller cities where property market curbs are less stiff. 
Prices in China's smaller cities, or known as tier-3 cities, grew 0.9 percent in April from a month ago, accelerating from an increase of 0.8 percent in March, while growth in tier-2 cities meanwhile remained flat at 0.6 pct, but in tier-1 cities the rate of increase halved to 0.3 percent, Yan Yuejin, an analyst with E-House China R&D Institute, said after analyzing the official data.
Regulators have intensified their crackdown on speculators since late March by taking tougher measures in at least two dozen cities to stop home prices from surging.
The curbs seemed to be working, as NBS data released on Monday had showed the area of property sold in April grew by slowest rate since December 2015. 
Prices actually fell in April, or at least their rise slowed in 31 cities surveyed, compared with 18 cities in March, the NBS said in a note accompanying the data release on Thursday. 
In China's biggest cities, prices for new units in Beijing grew at a slower pace on a monthly basis, while Shanghai prices dropped 0.1 percent, as local governments' tightening measures continued to take the heat off the market.
Shenzhen prices stayed unchanged in April, compared to a fall of 0.3 percent in March.
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen prices rose 16 percent, 13.2 percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
Still, prices in China's metropolises remained at elevated levels. A state think tank said on Monday that Beijing was the most expensive city in April with a median price of 63,647 yuan ($9,231) per square meter, or $858 per square feet, followed by Shanghai, Shenzhen and coastal city Xiamen.
Home prices in China's biggest cities were likely rise if government curbs were relaxed, a senior official from the country's top economic planner was quoted as saying in late April, suggesting that won't happen any time soon.
China's property resale market has started to be seen as more indicative of actual demand as it is not subject to the kinds of price caps widely applied to new projects to rein in price rises.
For existing homes, home prices rose 0.8 percent from a month ago, unchanged from the reading in March but still faster than the price growth for new sales projects, Reuters' calculations based on NBS data showed.
In contrast, the National Academy of Economic Strategy (NAES) of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a top government think tank, said China's property resale market cooled a notch in April due to intensified government curbs. It said chances of prices falling across the board are slim due to a shortage of housing supply.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobless rate fell to its lowest in four months in April but the number of people with full-time work declined - a mixed report that augurs poorly for a much-needed revival in wage growth and inflation.
The unemployment rate slipped to 5.7 percent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, compared with analysts' expectations for a steady 5.9 percent.
That and the 37,400-strong jump in jobs boosted the Australian dollar <AUD=D4> which rose a third of a U.S. cent to a two-week high. It was last up 0.3 percent at $0.7451.
""These figures further reduce any lingering chances of more rate cuts,"" said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics.
""But the labor market won't prompt the RBA to hike rates for a long time yet.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent for a ninth straight month in May as it balances weak domestic demand and inflation against escalating household debt.
It has repeatedly expressed worries about a ""mixed"" labor market. The minutes of its May policy meeting showed that board members had an in-depth discussion about employment, including the increasing share of part-time work.
Data out on Thursday showed all of the gains in jobs in April came from part-time employment which soared 49,000 while full-time work fell by 11,600. Total hours worked slipped 0.3 percent.
Over the past year, the increase in part-time jobs at 111,300 has outpaced the rise in full-time employment of 80,700. That is one reason wages are growing at a record low rate, undermining domestic consumption.
However, the RBA is constrained by the fear of spurring a debt binge in Australia's red-hot property market if it lowered interest rates deeper into record territory. It has left rates unchanged since last easing in August 2016.
MORE FULL-TIME WORK
Despite the weakness in April, the labor market is showing more signs of life with 101,000 full-time jobs added so far this year. While the number of part time has fallen marginally this year, despite April's rise.
Annual employment growth is running at 1.6 percent, and forward-looking indicators of employment such as job ads and business surveys have also been generally positive.
Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said further solid gains in employment growth were expected in the months ahead, but noted: ""Considerable labor market slack persists, which will continue to weigh on wage and consumer inflation.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter to mark the longest period of expansion in a decade, heightening prospects that robust overseas demand will underpin a steady recovery.
The data offers some relief to Bank of Japan policymakers, who are hoping that the economy gathers enough momentum to drive up wage growth and inflation, which remain low on soft household spending.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, grew an annualized 2.2 percent in January-March, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday, exceeding a median market forecast for a 1.7 percent rise to post the fastest growth rate since January-March 2016.
It marked the fifth straight quarter of expansion, the longest growth run since a six-quarter streak through 2006, when the Bank of Japan was exiting from its previous quantitative easing program on signs of strength in the economy.
""The economy is enjoying comfortable growth driven by both domestic and external demand,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
""Consumer spending remains relatively soft and it has a room to improve. But the economy passed the grade both in terms of the pace of growth and the quality of the expansion.""
Japan's economy has shown signs of life with exports and factory output benefiting from a pick-up in overseas demand.
But consumer prices are barely rising as companies remain wary of increasing wages, keeping the BOJ under pressure to maintain its massive stimulus despite signs of strength in the economy.
Nominal GDP, or GDP at current market prices, fell 0.1 percent in the first quarter after flat growth in October-December as weak demand prevented many firms from passing on rising import costs to households, underscoring the challenges of eradicating Japan's sticky deflationary mindset.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), increased 0.4 percent in the first quarter, matching market forecasts and posting its fifth straight quarter of increases.
Capital expenditure gained 0.2 percent in the first quarter, confounding market expectations for a 0.4 percent fall.
Offshore demand, or exports minus imports, added 0.1 percentage point to growth, a sign that improvements in overseas economies underpinned Japan's recovery.
Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara said there was no change to the government's view that the economy continued to recover moderately, backed by a tightening job market.

""But we need to be mindful of overseas economic uncertainties and the effect of market volatility,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage application activity recorded its steepest drop since December, retreating from an eight-week high, as various home borrowing costs held steady or rose modestly, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.
The Washington-based industry group said its measure on mortgage applications fell to 398.8 points in the week ended May 12 in a 4.1 percent decline from the prior week. This was the biggest weekly decrease since a 12.1 percent drop in the Dec. 23 week. 
Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.23 percent for a third straight week, while average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.01 to 0.02 percentage point higher than the previous week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Mortgage rates have held in a tight ranges since their surge in step with bond yields last November following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential win.
""This is just another example of market participants – in this case prospective borrowers – being lulled to sleep by the range,"" Walt Schmidt, FTN Financial's head of mortgage strategy, wrote in a research note.
Trump's victory had spurred bets on rising interest rates if he and a Republican-controlled Congress can quickly enact tax reforms, looser regulations and infrastructure spending.
Their struggle to pass their economic agenda, however, has led investors to reconsider whether any major legislation will pass in 2017.
The decline in mortgage activity stemmed from decreases in applications for refinancing and purchasing a home.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan declined 5.7 percent to 1,269.1 in its steepest weekly fall since December.
The share of refinancing fell to 41.1 percent of total applications, which was its smallest since September 2008 and was down from 41.9 percent the prior week.
The group's seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications to buy a home, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.7 percent to 243.6, scaling back from a 19-month high reached the prior week.

The average loan size for purchase applications reached $322,300 in the latest week, which is the largest ever since the MBA began its weekly application survey in 1990.

It was unclear what drove economic growth in the January-March period as the statistics service, Rosstat, only reveals a breakdown of the data with a time lag.
Gross domestic product (GDP) returned to growth in the fourth quarter, expanding by 0.3 percent after seven quarters of contraction that were mainly caused by a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis.
Signs of recovery have prompted Russian officials to pledge the economy will grow 2 percent this year, something about which independent experts are skeptical. The latest Reuters poll of analysts and economists forecast GDP will grow 1.1 percent this year.
Investors have also questioned the accuracy of Russian GDP figures after Rosstat recorded a GDP contraction of just 0.2 percent last year, much shallower than expected, while revising the 2015 contraction to just 2.8 percent from an initial 3.7 percent.

Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year, the weakest increase since July of last year and below expectations for a 2.2 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economist.
That meant pay, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year, the first fall since the third quarter of 2014.
Britain's opposition Labour Party has made weak wage growth one of its main themes ahead of a June 8 national election which opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Theresa May is on course to win.
While wage growth is weak, there are other signs of continued strength in the British labor market.
The unemployment rate in the period between January and March unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in nearly 42 years at 4.6 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to remain at 4.7 percent.
And the number of people in work rose by a strong 122,000, taking the employment rate to a new record of 74.8 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
The BoE is watching closely for signs of a pick-up in wages that could add to inflation which seems to be heading for around 3 percent due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit referendum and as oil prices rise.
So far the central bank believes there is little pressure on most employers to raise pay sharply which could feed a more permanent inflation problem.
Instead, the Bank has softened its previous forecasts for a rise in unemployment which it expects to stand at 4.7 percent this year, still above the level which it considers inflationary.
A survey published earlier on Wednesday showed inflation gnawed further into the budgets of British households this month, resulting in the sharpest fall in cash available to spend in two-and-a-half years.
Earlier this week, another survey showed employers plan to increase pay by just 1 percent in the year ahead, the weakest rate since 2013.
The ONS said workers' total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, edging up from growth of 2.3 percent in the three months to February and in line with the forecast in the Reuters poll of economists.
The BoE expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019.
Data released on Tuesday showed consumer price inflation picked up speed in April to hit 2.7 percent and many economists think it will reach 3 percent soon.
The ONS said the number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 19,400 to just under 793,000 in April, slower than an increase of 33,500 in March.

Economists taking part in the Reuters poll had expected the number of benefit claimants - which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn - to rise by 7,500.

The IHS Markit Household Finance Index fell to 42.4, down slightly from 42.5 in April. The fall was driven by a steep rise in living costs, resulting in the sharpest fall in cash available to spend in two-and-a-half years.
The survey drove home the challenge facing British households as inflation rises, with living costs a big campaign issue ahead of the June 8 election.
Official data on Tuesday showed inflation rose to its highest level since September 2013 at 2.7 percent last month, extending its sharp rise since the vote to leave the European Union.
""Recent pressures on UK consumer finances have been the sharpest for almost three years,"" said economist Tim Moore at data company IHS Markit.
""There are also signs that some households have responded to stretched budgets by taking on extra borrowing.""
Last week, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned 2017 will be challenging for consumers, with inflation now almost certain to overtake wage growth.

Moore said pessimism among Britons about the outlook for their finances in the next 12 months was the most widespread since late 2013.

Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.1% in the three months to March, missing forecasts for it remain in line with February’s 2.2% advance.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell short of expectations in March from the previous month and companies forecast a decline in investment over April-June, underscoring the fragile nature of the country's export-driven economic recovery.
But analysts say the data, considered as highly volatile, does not signal any major change in a moderate but broad-based uptrend in capital expenditure in a recovering economy.
Core orders, regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 1.4 percent in March from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday. The outcome marked a second straight rising month but undershot the median market forecast for a 2.1 percent gain.
Companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, would fall 5.9 percent in the April-June period following a 1.4 percent drop in the first quarter.
The weak outlook suggests some companies may be turning cautious on investing because of uncertainty about the possible impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies on export-reliant Japan.
""Uncertainty in the global economy, Trump's protectionist policies and the political situation in Europe all came together to produce a weak result,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Machinery export orders fell 2.8 percent in March to mark a second consecutive declining month, reflecting weak overseas demand for industrial, electronic and communications equipment.
But many analysts, including Minami, warned against reading too much into the temporary weakness in orders, pointing to prospects of recovery in global demand and business morale.
""The March result was weaker than expected but it's not that bad,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The global economy is recovering, business sentiment is improving...I don't think the underlying trend has changed.""
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment of the indicator, saying the pick-up in machinery orders was stalling.
Japan's economy has shown signs of life with exports and factory output benefiting from a pick-up in global demand.
Policymakers hope that companies will use some of their profits to boost wages and capital expenditure, helping to sustain a moderate recovery.
Data due out on Thursday is expected to show the economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in January-March, according to a Reuters poll.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wages are rising at their slowest pace on record at a time when household debt has climbed to an all-time peak, putting a lid on spending and a drag on the course of inflation.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said on Wednesday that its wage price index rose just 0.5 percent in Jan-March, matching forecasts and compared with a similar reading the previous quarter.
Annual wage growth held at 1.9 percent, the lowest on record. That was less than half the wage growth rate workers enjoyed a decade ago when a mining boom boosted pay across Australia.
The slowdown has contributed to an unwelcome decline in underlying inflation, which is below the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target band of 2-3 percent and has led to two interest rates cuts last year to a record low of 1.5 percent.
The central bank is worried about surging household debt alongside skyrocketing property prices at a time when income growth has slowed.
Households burdened by heavy mortgage debt have a reduced appetite for consumption, making the transmission of monetary policy weaker, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said earlier this month.
The central bank has argued that wage growth has finally bottomed, with its liaison with firms suggesting the constant downward pressure on labor costs was easing. It also expects underlying inflation to pick up by early 2018.
It sees wages rising gradually in line with an improvement in the jobs market and the end of the drag on growth from a slump in mining investment.
Yet there was scant sign of a pick-up in Wednesday's report. Not a single industry from manufacturing to healthcare raised wages more than 2.3 percent annually. Even mining has lost its Midas touch, with workers getting an annual rise of only 0.6 percent.
Wage hikes were more attractive in the public sector at 2.4 percent compared with 1.8 percent in the private sector.

(Reuters) - The amount of empty office space in London has jumped over the past 15 months and is likely to rise again despite potential for a post-Brexit business exodus that could drive down rental values, a survey showed on Wednesday.
A slowdown in the take-up of pre-used office space and longer periods to close rental deals bumped up availability by 36 percent last year and a further 19 percent in the first quarter of this year, the survey by Deloitte Real Estate showed.
Developers, however, continue to press ahead with new construction that is expected to push annual delivery of London office space to its highest since 2003, the survey showed.
""Developers are having to get on with developing buildings because we don't know what situation we're going to be in come 2019,"" Shaun Dawson, real estate research manager at Deloitte, told Reuters.
Financial services firms, large occupiers of London offices, need a regulated subsidiary in a European Union member state to offer their products across the bloc, which could lead some to move jobs out of Britain if the country's exit negotiations fail to secure continued access to the European single market.
Against this backdrop, the Deloitte survey published on Wednesday showed that 3.9 million sq ft of space was completed over the six months to March 31. That was the highest amount of space delivered in central London in a single survey since 2004. 
Furthermore, 28 new construction projects were started in the period, adding 3.2 million sq ft into the development pipeline.
Dawson said that above-average delivery of new space is expected to continue over the next five years, resulting in levels not seen since the early 1990s.
With a significant proportion of space under construction proceeding without guaranteed tenants, rental values could slide if demand is dented by Britain's looming departure from the EU.
However, there were signs of revised thinking by developers that had projects still five or so years out, with the planned completion of some schemes being put back to later years to limit supply, Deloitte said.
""The problem you have is that it is pretty difficult to stop when you're so close to development. You have to have contracts in place and all the builders ... so it's pretty difficult to stop,"" Dawson said.

""(But over the longer term) developers are looking at when to develop schemes and into what year.""

Domestic factory production increased 1.0 percent last month for its biggest monthly gain in over three years, but housing starts unexpectedly fell 2.6 percent, government data showed on Tuesday. 
The latest second-quarter gross domestic product estimate was faster than the 3.6 percent reading calculated on May 12, the Atlanta Fed said on its website.
The latest estimate was still below the initial figure of 4.3 percent calculated by the Atlanta Fed model on May 1.
The forecast of second-quarter residential investment growth climbed to 8.3 percent from 6.0 percent following the latest housing starts data, the regional Fed said.
Its view on final sales to private purchasers growth in the second quarter increased to 3.6 percent from 3.3 percent following the April industrial output report.

Atlanta Fed's estimate on the contribution of inventory investment to second-quarter GDP grew to 1.20 percentage points from 1.00 with motor vehicle and parts dealer inventories accounting for the bulk of the increase.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Motorists logged 272 billion miles (438 billion km) on U.S. roads and highways in March, a 0.8 percent increase year-on-year, according to data released on Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
U.S. vehicle miles traveled is up 1.5 percent year-over-year through the first three months of 2017. Motorists logged record volumes last year.
The continued strength in U.S. motor travel is welcome news for U.S. oil refiners and bullish traders who have seen signs of weakening demand for gasoline in January and February. 
U.S. gasoline demand, which accounts for 10 percent of global demand, was down 2.1 percent year-over-year during the first two months of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Preliminary weekly EIA estimates peg demand dropping 1 percent in March, figures show. 
The average fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the U.S. has risen by 0.2 miles-per-gallon since the start of the year, hitting 25.3 mpg in April, according to researches Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. 
The value for April is up 5.2 mpg since October 2007 - the first month of the university research - but down 0.2 mpg from the peak of 25.5 mpg reached in August 2014.

""One explanation for U.S. gasoline demand and vehicle miles traveled going in different directions is better fuel efficiency,"" said Linda Giesecke, a demand analyst at WoodMackenzie.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing production recorded its biggest increase in more than three years in April, bolstering the view that economic growth picked up early in the second quarter despite a surprise decline in homebuilding.
The broad strength in factory output reported by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday added to labor market data in suggesting the growth slowdown in the first quarter was temporary. That may allow the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates next month.
""The sharp increase in industrial activity is a clear sign that the first-quarter sluggishness is behind us. It comes at the right time as home construction seems to have hit a lull,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Manufacturing production jumped 1.0 percent last month, the biggest increase since February 2014, after falling 0.4 percent in March, the Fed said. The surge, which outstripped economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent gain, reflected a 5.0 percent rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts.
There were also healthy increases in the output of machinery, fabricated metal products, appliances and furniture, business equipment and chemical products. 
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Its recovery following a prolonged slump is being driven by a revival of the energy sector, which is spurring demand for machinery and other equipment.
Mining output increased 1.2 percent in April, contributing to the overall jump in industrial production. Industrial output has now increased for three straight months. 
The dollar hit a six-month low against the euro while prices of U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were flat as investors reacted to reports that U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russian officials last week.
HOUSING LOSING MOMENTUM
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million units, the lowest level in five months, hurt by persistent weakness in the construction of multi-family housing units.
Groundbreaking activity was also held down by a modest rebound in the construction of single-family homes. Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.26 million units last month.
Homebuilding increased 0.7 percent on a year-on-year basis. Building permits fell 2.5 percent in April.
While the weakness in residential construction implies a slowdown in homebuilding investment, the Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. 
The economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent pace in the first three months of 2017.
Demand for housing remains underpinned by a tightening labor market, characterized by an unemployment rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. A survey on Monday showed homebuilders' confidence rose in May amid bullishness about sales at the current time and over the next six months.
The underlying strength in the housing market helped  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, to report a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and same-store sales on Tuesday. 
Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) have remained a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy and higher wages drive new home sales and a rise in the value of existing houses spurs remodeling activity. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, rose 0.4 percent to a pace of 835,000 units last month, failing to recoup all of March's 5.1 percent decline. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 9.2 percent to a pace of 337,000 units. Multi-family starts have declined for four straight months, suggesting that rental increases have probably peaked.
Homebuilders are failing to take advantage of a chronic shortage of properties for sale amid complaints about expensive building materials and shortages of lots and labor.

""Homebuilding still requires manual labor as a key input into the production process,"" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. ""While the need for manual labor may be changing or declining in other industries, it's very hard to build a home without construction workers.""

The share of home loans in foreclosure was 1.39 percent in the first three months of 2017, down 14 basis points from the fourth quarter and 35 basis points lower than one year ago, the Washington-based industry group said.
“In addition, nearly all states had a decrease in the percentage of loans in foreclosure in the first quarter,"" MBA’s vice president of industry analysis Marina Walsh said in a statement.
Other measures on homeowners' creditworthiness generally improved in the first quarter, MBA said.
The delinquency rate for mortgages on one- to four-unit homes decreased to 4.71 percent in the first quarter, down 9 basis points from the fourth quarter and 6 basis points lower from a year earlier.
The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started was 0.30 percent in the first quarter, up 2 basis points from the previous quarter, but down 5 basis points from one year ago. This was the first rise in foreclosure starts since the fourth quarter of 2014, MBA said.
The year-over-year declines in late payments and foreclosure actions on ""conventional"" mortgages that are guaranteed by  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) and ones backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) stemmed from ongoing job growth and signs of rising wages, according to MBA.
""These fundamentals have helped to support the performance of all loan types – whether FHA, VA or conventional loans,"" Walsh said.

The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed its economic sentiment index rose to 20.6 from 19.5 points in the previous month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a rise to 22.0.
The positive sentiment reading came as the economy picked up speed in the first quarter of 2017. Companies invested more, consumers and the state continued to spend and exports soared despite the threat of rising protectionism.
Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, grew by 0.6 percent in the quarter from the quarter before, when it expanded 0.4 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said last Friday.
""The latest figures on gross domestic product confirm that the German economy is in good shape,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""The prospects for the euro zone as a whole are gradually improving, further strengthening the economic environment for German exports,"" he added.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions rose to 83.9 points from 80.1 in April. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast which predicted a reading of 82.0.
The upbeat ZEW report is the latest in a batch of solid data that are likely to help Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservatives burnish their economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election, when she will seek a fourth term.
Merkel received a boost on Sunday when her party won a regional election in the populous western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to one in five German voters and often seen as an indicator of national electoral trends.
The result put Merkel on course to retain power, welcome news for investors who regard her as an anchor of stability.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone increased its trade surplus with the rest of the world in March with both exports and imports rising markedly, in a sign that global commerce has so far not been hampered by protectionist calls.
The European Union statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday the 19-country currency area recorded a 30.9 billion euro ($34.1 billion) surplus in March in its goods trade balance with states outside the bloc, according to data not adjusted for seasonal factors.
The March surplus is nearly double that of February when the bloc has a positive balance of 17.8 billion euros, and also higher than a year earlier when the surplus was 28.2 billion euros.
The 19-country bloc, driven by Germany, expanded its exports by 13 percent in March on a yearly basis to a total value of 202.3 billion euros, unadjusted figures show.
Imports to the bloc also increased by 14 percent, although from a lower basis, showing that trade flows have not been affected by growing protectionist calls, such as from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Exports of the 28 EU countries to the United States in the first quarter increased by 11 percent compared with the same quarter last year.
Imports from the U.S. rose a more modest 4 percent, resulting in an expanded EU trade surplus with the U.S. totaling 30.6 billion euros from 23.6 billion euros recorded in the first quarter of 2016.
The EU increased its exports to all major trade partners in the first quarter of this year, with a 28 percent surge in sales to Russia and 22 percent increase in exports to China.
Imports from China grew only 3 percent, reducing the EU trade deficit with Beijing to 41.7 billion euros from 47.3 billion euros a year ago.
Figures adjusted for seasonal factors showed the euro zone surplus was 23.1 billion euros in March from 18.8 billion euros in February, with a 1.4 percent increase in exports on the month and a 1.1 percent drop in imports.

885,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",UK inflation jumps more than expected in April to hit highest since 2013,"LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation rose to its highest level since September 2013 last month, according to official data on Tuesday that underlined a growing squeeze on households ahead of the June 8 national election.
Consumer prices increased in April by 2.7 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly above economists' expectation for a 2.6 percent annual rise in a Reuters poll.
Inflation has accelerated in Britain in recent months, pushed up by a weakening of the pound since last year's decision by voters to leave the European Union, and by the rise in oil prices which has fueled inflation in other countries too.
Last week Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned this year would be challenging for consumers, saying that wages are about to fall in real, inflation-adjusted terms.
But with little sign of an overheating domestic economy, all but one of the BoE's eight policymakers voted last week to keep rates on hold.
The latest inflation figures were boosted most of all by rising airfares during the Easter holidays, which were in March last year. Rising clothing prices, higher car tax and electricity also pushed up consumer prices.
Many economists say the impact of the fall in sterling on consumer prices will be felt more strongly in the coming months, and the central bank expects inflation to peak at nearly 3 percent by the end of this year.
Excluding oil prices and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose to 2.4 percent, the strongest rate since March 2013 and above economists' expectations for it to rise to 2.2 percent.
Services prices - which the BoE view as a guide to domestic inflation pressures - rose by 3.0 percent, the biggest jump since September 2013, though this was affected by higher air fares.
Factory output prices - a guide to future consumer price pressures - increased 3.6 percent, unchanged from the previous month and above forecasts of a 3.4 percent annual increase in the Reuters poll.
Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose at the weakest annual pace since November, up 16.6 percent.
The ONS said house prices in March rose at their weakest rate since October 2013, up 4.1 percent on the year.

Prices in London alone grew just 1.5 percent, the weakest since March 2012.

Registrations dropped to 1.23 million cars last month in the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said, down from 1.32 million a year earlier. 
The decline in April registrations, the first monthly drop this year, limited the four-month increase to 4.5 percent to 5.49 million cars, ACEA said.
This year Easter was in April, leading to more depressed sales figures when compared with a year earlier, ACEA said.
Registrations of VW, the biggest selling car brand in Europe, fell by 14 percent in April, while  Renault  (PA:RENA), the next best selling brand, saw sales decline 3.3 percent, statistics showed. Sales at Vauxhall and Opel fell 13.1 percent.
Nearly every auto brand posted falling sales, with the exception of Toyota (T:7203), which saw sales rise by 5.4 percent, and Kia, which saw sales increase by 8.1 percent.
The main reason European sales fell is because the region's two largest markets, Germany and the United Kingdom, saw registrations drop 8 percent and 19.8 percent respectively, ACEA figures showed.
Among the large markets, only Spain saw sales rise, posting a 1.1 percent gain, while deliveries in France and Italy fell by 6 percent and 4.6 percent respectively, statistics based on national registration figures published earlier this month showed.

""These are very strong figures, above all forecasts ... One can assume that the economy will grow around 2 percent this year, which is the best pace in years for Finland, and above the euro zone average,"" said economist Juhana Brotherus from Hypo Bank.
Economists noted, however, that growth in March cooled down from January and February where figures were boosted by a peak in construction revenue, a one-off ship delivery and an exceptionally weak comparison period in exports.
""The economy may grow fast momentarily, but in longer term, there are no prerequisites for growth of 3 percent with the ageing population, low productivity and global economic landscape,"" Brotherus said.
So far, latest official growth forecasts by banks and the government vary from 1.2 to 1.8 percent for 2017 and from 1.0 to 2.0 percent for 2018. OLUSECON Reuters US Online Report Economy 20170516T073347+0000"

The National Association of Home Builders and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said on Monday their index of builder confidence in newly built, single-family homes climbed to 70 points from 68 in April. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the reading to be unchanged in May from April.
In March, the index reached 71 which was the highest since June 2005 during the height of the prior housing boom.
“This report shows that builders’ optimism in the housing market is solidifying, even as they deal with higher building material costs and shortages of lots and labor,” NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald, said in a statement.
Some analysts cautioned the rise in mortgage rates this year would limit a pickup in home construction.
""While we expect a slight moderation in housing activity in the near term owing to higher mortgage rates, the picture for 2017-18 remains one of modest trend improvement,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Blerina Uruci wrote in a research note.
The NAHB index is seen as a proxy on domestic housing starts.
The government will release its April housing starts report at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast builders likely broke ground at an annualized rate of 1.260 million units, faster than a 1.215 million unit pace in March. 
The survey's gauge on current single-family home sales rose to 76 points from 74 in April, while its six-month sales outlook index increased to 79, which was the highest since June 2005, from 75.
On the other hand, the barometer on prospective buyers dipped to 51 in May from 52. 

On a regional basis, three of the four U.S. regions NAHB tracks, the Northeast, South and West, showed improved builder sentiment in May, but the Midwest recorded a decline.

The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions declined to -1.0 from +5.2 in April. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of +7.0 for May.
Analysts cautioned the index's downturn may be a harbinger of a possible deterioration in the manufacturing sector.
""We have been expecting some cooling in the manufacturing sector following a solid start to the year, but if the Empire State survey’s orders index proves to be a reliable forward-looking indicator, the slowdown could be more severe than we had been anticipating,"" J.P. Morgan economist Daniel Silver wrote in a research note.
The New York Fed index reached +18.7 in February, which was the highest since September 2014, propelled by hopes that Donald Trump's capture of the White House together with a Republican-controlled Congress would result in tax reform, infrastructure spending and looser regulations which would boost the economy.
That optimism on fiscal stimulus from Washington has diminished in recent weeks as the administration and leading Republican lawmakers have been slow in making progress on these major economic legislations.
The New York Fed survey's component on new orders, a proxy on future business activity, also sagged into the red to -4.4, the weakest level since September from +7.0 in April.
The employment gauge slipped to +11.9 from +13.9, while its six-month outlook index softened to +39.3 from +39.9.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Resales of Canadian homes fell 1.7 percent in April from record highs in March as new listings spiked, the Canadian Real Estate Association said on Monday in a report that suggested a long-awaited slowdown in housing had begun.
The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 7.5 percent from April 2016, while home prices surged 19.8 percent from a year ago, according to the group's home price index.
Sales declined in close to 70 percent of markets, led by Toronto, where skyrocketing home prices had sparked fears of a bubble and prompted the provincial government to introduce new measures in April to rein in the market.
“Home buyers and sellers both reacted to the recent Ontario government policy announcement aimed at cooling housing markets in and around Toronto,” CREA Chief Economist Gregory Klump said in a statement.
He said the number of new listings spiked to record levels in and around Toronto and far-flung suburbs, where a severe shortage of listings had helped drive prices higher.
""It suggests these housing markets have started to cool,"" Klump said.
New listings rose 36 percent in the Greater Toronto Area and were up 10 percent nationally, the report showed, helping to ease the national sales-to-new listings ratio to 60.1 percent in April from 67.3 percent in March. 
A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is considered balanced, and Canada's housing market had been firmly in seller's market territory for months. 
There were 4.2 months of inventory at the end of April, up slightly from 4.1 months in March, CREA said.
Sales rose in Vancouver, which has mostly cooled since a foreign buyers tax was introduced last August, but remained down from record levels before the tax. 
While sales slowed, prices continued to rise at a double-digit pace, according to the group's Home Price Index, which is used to ease the distortion caused by the expensive Toronto and Vancouver markets compared to the rest of the country.

The actual national average price was up 10.4 percent at C$559,317 ($410,749) compared to a year earlier, the report showed.

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index fell to -1.0 this month from a reading of 5.2 in April. Analysts had expected the index to inch up to 7.0 in May.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
The new orders index dropped to -4.4, suggesting a small decline in orders, and the shipments index edged down to 10.6, indicating that shipments increased at a slightly slower pace than in April.
Labor market indicators pointed to a modest increase in both employment and hours worked, and input prices and selling prices rose at a more moderate pace.
Indexes assessing the six-month outlook were close to last month’s levels, and continued to convey a high degree of optimism about future conditions.
The Empire State index is of interest to traders primarily because it is seen as an early forecast of the national Institute for Supply management factory survey.
USD/JPY was at 113.45 from 113.55 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0973 from around 1.0968 earlier, while GBP/USD was at 1.2925 from 1.2922.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 98.74, compared to 98.78 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open. The Dow futures pointed to an increase of 0.2%, the S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.1%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,234.70 a troy ounce, compared to $1,234.00 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $49.54 a barrel from $49.52 earlier.

896,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2017 07:11AM ET</span>",UK employers plan smallest pay rises since 2013: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers plan to increase pay at the weakest rate since 2013, a survey showed on Monday, offering poor prospects for British households already strained by higher inflation since last year's Brexit vote.
Employers on average expected to raise basic pay awards in the year ahead by 1.0 percent, down from 1.5 percent in the previous quarter's survey, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said.
Last week Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that households faced a challenging time, as wage growth was set to turn negative in inflation-adjusted terms.
Rising inflation, fueled by rising energy costs and the pound's post Brexit vote plunge, almost completely canceled out the growth in pay of British workers during the three months to February, official data showed last month.
Living standards are a hot political topic ahead of a June 8 national election. Prime Minister Theresa May will promise on Monday to extend British workers' rights in a push to win over supporters of the opposition Labour Party.
While the BoE's expectation for solid economic growth in the next few years hinges on wage growth picking up significantly, the CIPD survey showed no sign that employers are thinking about ratcheting up pay as yet.
Gerwyn Davies, labor market adviser at the CIPD, said weak pay partly reflected British businesses' long-standing difficulties at raising productivity, and said he expected living standards would fall for many employees this year.
""This could create higher levels of economic insecurity and could have serious implications for consumer spending, which has helped to support economic growth in recent months,"" .
Other indicators of future wage growth, like the monthly REC survey and the Bank of England's regional agents' report, have pointed to a dearth of upward pressure on pay.
The government capped annual basic pay rises for most public-sector workers at 1 percent in 2013, after a three-year pay freeze.
The CIPD said pay expectations for the private sector held steady at 2.0 percent, but weakened in the voluntary sector and were stuck at 1.0 percent in the public sector.
Still, the survey suggested employment will continue to increase in the second quarter, albeit at a slower rate than at the start of this year.
Official monthly labor market data are due on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect growth in average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, held steady at 2.2 percent in the three months to March.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy contracted in the first three months of the year but less than in the final quarter of 2016, flash estimates by its statistics service showed on Monday, as jitters over the conclusion of a bailout review hurt business confidence.
The data showed the economy shrank 0.1 percent in January-to-March compared to last year's final quarter when gross domestic product contracted by 1.2 percent.
The seasonally adjusted data also showed that the Greek economy contracted at an annual 0.5 percent pace in the first quarter, at a slower clip than in the fourth quarter of 2016, when it shrank by 1.1 percent.
""The weakness seen in the fourth quarter continued but at a softer pace in the first three months,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
""It's an encouraging sign given that up until February uncertainty over the successful conclusion of a bailout review remained high.""
Greece and its foreign creditors reached a deal on reforms in early May after six months of tense negotiations that hurt economic activity.
The leftist-led government hopes that legislating new austerity measures by May 18 will allow its euro zone partners to approve the deal when they meet on May 22 and to release a new tranche of bailout funds.
The government downwardly revised this year's growth projection to 1.8 percent from 2.7 percent previously when it unveiled its medium-term fiscal strategy on Sunday.
It expects the recovery to strengthen next year with GDP growing by 2.4 percent. Last week the EU Commission also cut its economic growth forecast for Greece to 2.1 from 2.7 percent.
Economists said the downward revisions rendered the forecasts more realistic.
""The Q1 flash estimates were broadly in line with expectations,"" said Eurobank's chief economist Platon Monokroussos.
""GDP growth dynamics are likely to strengthen in the months ahead on expectations for a bailout review deal and a strong tourism season. But full-year forecasts are biased to the downside due to the soft Q1 start and last year's carry-over.""

The statistics service is likely to revise the flash estimates when it releases provisional first quarter data on June 2.

898,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2017 02:29AM ET</span>",China's economy loses momentum as policymakers clamp down on debt risks,"By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's growth took a step back in April after a surprisingly strong start to the year, as factory output to investment to retail sales all tapered off as authorities clamped down on debt risks in an effort to stave off a potentially damaging hit to the economy.
Waking up to the systemic threat posed by cheap credit-fueled stimulus since the 2008-9 global financial crisis, Beijing has continued to tighten the screws on speculative financing over the past several months.
Data on Monday highlighted the broad economic impact of these regulatory curbs, with below-forecast factory output in April and fixed-asset investment in the first four months of the year reinforcing evidence of a weakening manufacturing sector and slowing momentum in the world's second-biggest economy.
""If anything (the slowdown) is even faster than we expected,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics in Singapore in an interview before the data was released.
However, ""we're still some way off from the economy weakening to the point where it will test the tolerance of policymakers...as the urgency to address some of these financial risk issues (is even greater),"" he said.
Factory output was up 6.5 percent in April from a year earlier, down from 7.6 percent in March, and fixed-asset investment rose 8.9 percent in the first four months of the year, off the 9.2 percent pace in Jan-March. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted factory output would grow by 7.1 percent in April, and tipped fixed asset investment to rise 9.1 percent in Jan-April.
Output growth slowed on tumbling steel and iron ore prices amid concern over rising inventories after China's mills cranked out as much metal as possible to drive factory production to its highest since December 2014.
However, on a volume basis, steel output hit a record in April, data Monday showed, stoking worries of a growing glut as demand remains flat even as China says it is ahead of schedule on capacity reduction targets.
Fixed asset investment in the manufacturing sector also slowed over Jan-April, with growth of 4.9 percent down from 5.8 percent in the first quarter. Infrastructure spending, however, continued to grow over 23 percent year-on-year in the same period, supported by Beijing's Belt and Road initiative to expand investment links with Asia, Africa and Europe.
PROPERTY COOLS 
Analysts say Beijing is keen to ensure steady economic growth ahead of the 19th Communist Party Congress later in the year. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles which analysts say may pose a threat to the Asian economic giant if not handed well.
China's central bank has been guiding short-term interest rates higher to help contain debt perils, though it is treading cautiously to avoid hurting economic growth. 
A red-hot property market, fueled by speculative investments, has been identified by analysts and policymakers as one of the biggest risks to growth.
Monday's data showed investment in property development picked up in April, although sales growth was significantly slower, suggesting investment in the sector remained robust even as intensified government controls to rein in the market began to take effect.
The area of property sold grew 7.7 percent year-on-year in April, the lowest since December 2015 and well short of the 14.7 percent increase in March. 
SOFTER CONSUMPTION
Retail sales rose 10.7 percent in April from a year earlier, weaker than March's 10.9 percent gain as home appliances and automobile sales growth slowed from March. 
At the same time, growth in the services sector slowed to 8.1 percent year-on-year, down from 8.3 percent growth in March and the slowest since December. 
""Slowing domestic consumption growth and softer external demand appear to have driven the slowdown in China at the start of the second quarter,"" Capital Economics' Evans-Pritchard said in a note following the data release. 
The country's first quarter economic growth came in at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent, the quickest since 2015 on higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom.
China has cut its economic growth target to around 6.5 percent this year to give policymakers more room to push through painful reforms and contain financial risks after years of debt-fueled stimulus.
But with the ambitious new Silk Road global development initiative and the Xiong'an ""satellite"" capital plan, analysts don't expect China to stray too far from the investment-led growth model.
Indeed, Chinese President Xi Jinping's Xi on Sunday pledged an additional $124 billion for the Belt and Road initiative. 
""Growth will continue to be underpinned by a strong infrastructure pipeline which also echoes the Belt and Road initiative and urbanization projects like Xiong'an,"" ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang wrote in a note. 

""China seems to have returned to an investment-driven growth strategy.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy expanded at its fastest quarterly pace in four years in the first quarter boosted by recovering exports, but monetary policy will likely remain loose to cushion still-subdued investment activity.
The government raised its export outlook for 2017, suggesting the recovery was gaining traction, but Southeast Asia's second-largest economy faces rising global trade protectionism and capital outflow risks as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates again this year.
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, aided also by household holding and tourism, the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) said on Monday.
The pace was slightly faster than the 1.2 percent forecast in a Reuters poll and the 0.5 percent growth in the previous quarter, which was revised up from 0.4 percent.
From a year earlier, growth was 3.3 percent, also slightly better than a median forecast of 3.2 percent, and the 3.0 percent in the final quarter of last year.
""We expect growth to pick up a little further in the coming quarters, helped by robust external demand, supportive fiscal and monetary policies, and the current state of relative political calm,"" Krystal Tan of Capital Economics wrote.
The planning agency narrowed its 2017 economic growth forecast to 3.3-3.8 percent from 3.0-4.0 percent projected earlier. It raised its export growth outlook to 3.6 percent from 2.9 percent. Exports, worth about two-thirds of the economy, are recovering after years of decline.
""Growth in exports was more a result of price effects than volume effects, supported by higher commodity prices,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research at Kasikornbank.
Thailand's economic growth has lagged other regional peers since 2014, when the army seized power to end months of street protests. The junta has ramped up spending and investment in a bid to lift domestic activity. But large infrastructure projects have been slow getting off the ground.
Exports in the first quarter jumped 6.6 percent from a year earlier and household spending increased 3.2 percent while overall public and private investment rose 1.7 percent, NESDB data showed.
NESDB chief Porametee Vimolsiri, also a rate-setting committee member, said private investment should recover in the second half of the year and that monetary policy should continue to be accommodative.
The central bank has left its benchmark interest rate <THCBIR=ECI> unchanged at 1.50 percent since April 2015. It next reviews policy on May 24, when most economists expect no change.

Economist Barnabas Gan of OCBC Bank in Singapore, however, said the strong growth data and potentially higher U.S. rates later this year may serve as an impetus for the Thai central bank to raise rates by 25 basis points later this year.

Growth in property investment, which mainly focuses on residential but also includes commercial and office space, accelerated to 9.6 percent in April from a year earlier, compared to 9.4 percent in March, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Real estate investment is a major driver of the economy affecting more than 40 other sectors. But worries over the potential bursting of price bubbles in China's biggest cities have led to a flurry of government cooling measures in recent months as buyer demand appeared to be more resilient than expected. 
The area of property sold grew 15.7 percent in January-April from the same period a year earlier, down from 19.5 percent in the first three months of the year, the NBS said.
In April alone, sales grew 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2015 and well short of the 14.7 percent increase in March.
New construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developer confidence and correspondingly volatile, rose 11.1 percent in the first four months of the year, moderating from a 11.6 percent rise in the first three months, the bureau said. 
Prices in China's sizzling property market accelerated in March on a monthly basis, shaking off the impact of recent cooling measures introduced to dampen speculative demand.
Home prices in China's biggest cities were likely to rebound if government curbs were relaxed, a senior official from the country's top economic planner was quoted as saying in late April, suggesting authorities are in no mood to lift restrictions soon.
Some 1.7 trillion yuan ($247 billion) in property loans were issued in the first quarter of 2017, central bank data showed, reflecting robust demand in the sector. 
But analysts say China's hot property market appeared to have peaked and investment usually lags behind sales trends. Regulators intensified the crackdown on speculators by rolling out more draconian measures in big cities from late March.
China's liquidity conditions have also been tightened in the past few weeks, driven mainly by fortified regulatory efforts at financial deleveraging since late March. Various Chinese cities also adopted more lending restrictions to curb credit risks. 

The rate of inventory destocking appeared to be quickening in response to robust demand in recent months. Growth in inventory floor area in the first four months was 7.2 percent lower than one year earlier, compared with a fall of 6.4 percent in the January-to-March period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased broadly in April while consumer prices rebounded, pointing to a pickup in economic growth and a gradual rise in inflation that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates next month.
The reports on Friday added to labor market data in suggesting the near stall in economic activity in the first quarter was an anomaly. But a moderation in year-on-year inflation led financial markets to dial down expectations of at least two more rate increases this year.
""The economy picked it up a notch from the slow start earlier this year, but the inflation fires are not burning brightly and this will likely keep the Fed on just a gradual pace for interest rate hikes later this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in March. Sales rose 4.5 percent in April on a year-on-year basis.
Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.6 percent last month. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales gained 0.2 percent after advancing 0.7 percent in March.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, held back by the weakest increase in consumer spending in more than seven years. The Atlanta Fed estimates GDP will rise at a 3.6 percent pace in the second quarter.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent after dropping 0.3 percent in March. The rise in prices suggested that March's decline, which was the first in 13 months, was an aberration.
In the 12 months through April, the CPI increased 2.2 percent. While that was a slowdown from March's 2.4 percent increase, it still exceeded the 1.7 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years.
Financial markets are pricing in more than a 70 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's June 13-14 policy meeting, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch program. But the likelihood the U.S. central bank will raise rates twice before the end of the year fell after Friday's data.
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March and has forecast two more hikes this year.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose and the U.S. dollar (DXY) weakened against a basket of currencies after the release of Friday's data. U.S. stocks were trading mostly lower, pulled down by weak financial and industrial sectors.
'COMPETITIVE PRESSURES'
Gasoline prices jumped 1.2 percent in April after falling 6.2 percent in March. Food prices rose 0.2 percent as prices for fresh vegetables recorded their biggest increase since February 2011.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent last month, reversing March's 0.1 percent dip. The monthly core CPI was restrained by declines in the prices of wireless phone services, medical care, motor vehicles and apparel.
Rental costs increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in March. The core CPI increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, the smallest gain since October 2015, after rising 2.0 percent in March. Still, April's increase was above the 1.8 percent average annual increase over the past decade.
""To some extent, this new weakness in price inflation is due to competitive pressures rather than weak demand, so the Fed can afford to discount it,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Consumer spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, marked by an unemployment rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. A third report on Friday showed consumer sentiment rose in early May as the outlook for wages improved.
Motor vehicle sales increased 0.7 percent in April after three straight months of decreases.
There were hefty gains in sales at building material and electronics and appliance stores.
But sales at clothing stores fell 0.5 percent. Department store retailers have been hurt by declining traffic in shopping malls and increased competition from online retailers, led by Amazon.com (O:AMZN).
Retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) said on Friday its net loss widened to $180 million, or 58 cents per share, in the first quarter. On Thursday, Macy's Inc (N:M) reported a 4.6 percent drop in first-quarter sales.

Sales at online retailers jumped 1.4 percent in April.

The Commerce Department said business inventories increased 0.2 percent after a similar gain in February.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories increased 0.5 percent in March instead of the 0.4 percent increase reported in an advance report published last month. Retail inventories rose 0.3 percent in February.
Motor vehicle inventories increased 0.9 percent after jumping 1.0 percent in the prior month amid declining sales.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, increased 0.3 percent instead of the 0.2 percent increase reported last month.
They fell 0.1 percent in February.
Inventory investment subtracted 0.93 percentage point from GDP in the first quarter, helping to hold down economic growth to a 0.7 percent annualized pace, the weakest performance in three years.
Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for the two previous quarters.
Business sales were unchanged in March after rising 0.2 percent in February.

At March's sales pace, it would take 1.35 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from February.

The rise in prices suggested that March's drop, which was the first in 13 months, was an aberration.
In the 12 months through April, the CPI increased 2.2 percent.
While that was a slowdown from March's 2.4 percent increase, the year-on-year gain in the CPI was still larger than the 1.7 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent last month and advancing 2.3 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in March. The monthly core CPI was restrained by declines in the price of wireless phone services, medical care, motor vehicles and apparel.
The core CPI increased 1.9 percent year-on-year after rising 2.0 percent in March. April's increase was above the 1.8 percent
average annual increase over the past decade.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.6 percent.
Still, April's increase in consumer prices added to a tightening labor market and rising producer inflation in suggesting that the U.S. central bank could raise borrowing costs at its June 13-14 policy meeting.
The Fed increased its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March and has forecast two more rate hikes

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices gained 0.2% in April from a month earlier, in line with expectations and compared to a 0.3% decline in the prior month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.2% last month, below forecasts for a 2.3% increase and easing from the 2.4% advance seen in March.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, compared to estimates for a 0.2% increase and March’s 0.1% drop.
Core CPI increased at an annualized rate of 1.9% in April, below the consensus forecast of no change from March’s reading of 2.0%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 0.4% in April from the prior month, below forecasts for a gain of 0.6%. March retail sales increased 0.1%, whose figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% drop.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in April, below consensus expectations for a 0.5% advance. Core sales in the prior month were revised to a 0.3% advance from the prior flat reading.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc fell by 0.1 percent from February, but rose by 1.9 percent year-on-year.
Both figures were lower than market expectations of increases of 0.3 percent in the month and of 2.3 percent from a year earlier.
The unexpected fall is, however, unlikely to change the growth outlook for the bloc at the start of the year, with preliminary estimates showing a healthy 0.5 percent rise in the first quarter.
This is mostly because the March drop was offset by upwardly revised data for February, when output dropped only by 0.1 percent instead of a previously estimated 0.3 percent fall. On the year, production went up by 1.4 percent in February, more than the 1.2 percent rise estimated by Eurostat a month ago.
The March monthly output decrease was due to a 3.2 percent decline in energy production, the only indicator that recorded a drop.
Output went up by 2.1 percent for non-durable consumer goods, such as canned food and clothing, after a 1.3 percent drop in February.
Factories also produced more durable consumer goods for a second consecutive month, with a rise of 0.9 percent, in a sign that firms expected consumers to spend more on expensive products, such as fridges and cars.
Output of intermediate goods also went up by 0.3 percent, while production of capital goods, such as machinery, increased by 0.2 percent.

Non-farm private-sector payrolls rose by 49,400 or 0.3 percent in the first quarter, after rising an upwardly revised 67,300 or 0.4 percent in the previous quarter, INSEE said in a first estimate for the first three months of 2017.
The increase brought the overall level to 16.228 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008 just before the global financial crisis began taking its toll on the French economy.
The improvement was driven by the services sector, where 56,200 net new jobs helped offset the destruction of 4,800 in the industrial sector and 2,000 in construction.
The steady creation of new jobs, almost exclusively in services, since the second quarter of 2015, is gradually helping heal France's labor market after huge job losses during the financial crisis.
However so far the increase has not been enough to bring unemployment substantially lower, partly because the number of people in the job market has also been rising.

926,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2017 05:17AM ET</span>","German economic growth picks up speed, good news for Merkel","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy defied increased political risks and picked up speed in the first quarter of 2017 as companies invested more, consumers and the state continued to spend and exports soared despite the threat of rising protectionism.
Europe's biggest economy grew by 0.6 percent in the quarter from the quarter before, when it expanded 0.4 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.
That was the strongest quarterly growth rate since the first quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7 percent. It was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
The figures are the latest in a batch of solid data that are likely to help Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-right CDU/CSU bloc to burnish their economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election, when she will seek a fourth term.
Merkel's conservatives have already widened their lead in opinion polls over the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who are junior partners in the current coalition and want to replace Merkel with their chancellor candidate, Martin Schulz.
""A boom without end in Germany ... and despite all the risks,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger said, calling it a good sign that the upswing was based on a broad foundation.
""However, it should be noted that the economy would be humming less without the support of interest rates, which are too low for Germany,"" he added, in reference to the European Central Bank's ultra-loose monetary policy.
The Federal Statistics Office said investments in buildings and equipment grew strongly, partly due to a mild winter, while households and state authorities increased their expenditures slightly at the beginning of the year.
Trade also gained momentum and supported growth as exports grew more than imports, it said. On the year, gross domestic product grew 1.7 percent seasonally unadjusted, also in line with the consensus forecast.
'DOPING COCKTAIL'
""The economy continues to benefit from a doping cocktail of low interest rates, favourable oil prices and an export-boosting exchange rate,"" DIHK managing director Martin Wansleben said.
He added that numerous risks, such as U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist threats and the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations, had not slowed growth so far.
""Companies are increasing their spending on machinery and equipment in order to seize the opportunities of digitisation, remain internationally competitive and drive innovation.""
The BGA trade and wholesale association said Germany's economic engine was running smoothly, supporting overall growth in the euro zone.
""Unemployment is low, publics finances are sound, tax revenues are soaring - and countries like France, Italy and Spain also benefit from our success thanks to rising imports of intermediate goods,"" BGA head Anton Boerner said.
The data also underlines the strength of the German economy compared with its peers.
The French economy, the second-largest in the euro zone, grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, slowing from 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2016, preliminary data showed.
For Italy, the third-biggest economy in the 19-member bloc, the national central bank has projected quarterly growth of 0.2 percent. Preliminary data are due next Tuesday.
The Spanish economy powered ahead, however, with a stronger-than-expected growth rate of 0.8 percent in the first quarter, above the euro zone average of 0.5 percent.

Outside the euro zone, Britain's economy slowed to 0.3 percent in the first three months of 2017 from 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter.

""For Malaysia, the growth momentum since the second half of 2016 is expected to strengthen in the first quarter of 2017, and to be sustained for the rest of the year,"" the central bank said in a statement.
All 10 economists polled by Reuters had correctly predicted Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) would hold its overnight rate .
A slim minority expected the bank might have to raise rates later in the year to keep inflation in check, and due to potential capital-outflow pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve's tightenings. 
""BNM had an easy decision today: inflation is high but likely peaked and the economy is recovering, although far from roaring with a vengeance,"" said Trinh Nguyen, Hong Kong-based senior economist for investment bank Natixis.
""The central bank is going to keep this easy monetary policy stance in H1 2017 to support the fragile economic upturn."" 
BNM said growth will mainly be driven by domestic demand amid continued wage and employment gains, and the implementation of new and on-going investment projects.
Malaysia's economy grew 4.2 percent in 2016, its slowest pace since contracting in 2009, on poor global demand for oil and gas and commodity exports.
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, however, ended a year of tepid activity on a high as resurgent exports boosted growth by 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
BNM said the ringgit currency  - which hit a near 19-year low of 4.4980 to the dollar on Jan. 4 - has continued to stabilize.
The ringgit was up at 4.3460 in mid-afternoon trade on Friday. 
HIGH INFLATION
Inflation hit an eight-year high of 5.1 percent in March,
BNM, which said headline inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent in the first quarter, doesn't expect price pressures to hurt growth. It is maintaining its full year 2017 growth forecast of 4.3-4.8 percent.
""The higher headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year,"" the central bank said.
Controlling inflation and rising living costs is a challenge to Prime Minister Najib Razak, as he prepares to call early polls, possibly this year.
Echoing this week's warning by the International Monetary Fund, BNM said global growth faces risks from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, and commodity price volatility.
""These risks could also reignite financial market volatility,"" the central bank said.

Central government spending rose 3 percent in April from a year earlier while local government spending grew 3.9 percent, the finance ministry said on Friday.
The slowdown in spending was mainly due to significant expenditure earlier, the ministry said in a statement on its website.
Government spending in January-April rose 16.3 percent from a year earlier, it said.
Government-led stimulus has been a major driver of economic growth over the past years, but the pump-priming has also been accompanied by runaway credit growth and has created a mountain of debt.
Authorities have stepped up efforts in the last several months to curb debt and housing risks, and a raft of recent data has showed signs of cooling in the economy, which expanded a solid 6.9 percent in the first quarter.
Fiscal revenue increased 11.8 percent in the first four months and was up 7.8 percent in April from a year earlier, slowing from March's 12.2 percent rise, the ministry said.
China has kept its budget deficit at 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2017, the same as last year, and pledged to clamp down on risks associated with local government debt.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week while producer prices rebounded strongly in April, pointing to a tightening labor market and rising inflation that could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June.
Labor market strength was also underscored by a sharp drop in the number of Americans on unemployment rolls to a 28-1/2-year low in the final week of April.
""The best labor market in nearly 30 years should tell Fed officials that additional monetary stimulus is not required. We expect them to put another rate hike notch on their belts at the upcoming June meeting,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 236,000 for the week ended May 6, the Labor Department said on Thursday, confounding economists' expectations for a rise to 245,000. 
It was the 114th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold which is associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The labor market is close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 61,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended April 29, the lowest level since November 1988.
Labor market momentum, also marked by a sharp rebound in job growth in April, has left financial markets anticipating further monetary policy tightening from the Fed's June 13-14 meeting.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries briefly fell on the data, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note (US2YT=RR) rising to a near two-month high. 
Stocks on Wall Street declined as a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly profit and sales at department store Macy's (N:M) hurt consumer discretionary shares. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
BROAD-BASED PPI RISE 
The U.S. central bank increased its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March and has forecast two more rate hikes this year. The economy created 211,000 job in April after adding only 79,000 positions in March.
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.5 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in March. 
The PPI increased 2.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the biggest gain since February 2012, after advancing 2.3 percent in March. Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2 percent and gaining 2.2 percent from a year ago.
Producer prices are firming in part as the drag from a strong dollar fades. Prices for final demand services rose 0.4 percent in April, accounting for almost two-thirds of the increase in the PPI last month. 
They had dipped 0.1 percent in March. The rise in the cost of services last month was driven by a 6.6 percent surge in prices for securities brokerage, dealing, investment advice and related services.
Prices for goods increased 0.5 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in March. Energy prices rose 0.8 percent, with the cost of gasoline jumping 3.9 percent. Energy prices declined 2.9 percent in March. 
Food prices increased 0.9 percent after a similar increase in March. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services surged a record 0.7 percent in April. The so-called core PPI edged up 0.1 percent in March.
The core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through April, the biggest gain since August 2013, after the revamping of the PPI series. It advanced 1.7 percent in March.
""The core reading for producer prices shows the Fed could reach their inflation target sooner than previously thought,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.

The cost of healthcare services were unchanged after nudging up 0.1 percent in March. Those healthcare costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index.

The increase matched estimates from analysts in a Reuters poll. Compared with March 2016, prices climbed by 3.3 percent, largely reflecting continued strength in Toronto.
Prices in Toronto, which accounts for 25.49 percent of the entire Canadian market, edged up by 0.2 percent in March.

Vancouver prices posted their first price increase in five months, jumping by 0.7 percent on better market conditions. Vancouver is the largest city in the Pacific province of British Columbia, where the government imposed a 15 percent property transfer tax on foreign real estate buyers last August.

The price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern and which account for one-third of new housing.

""We estimate that growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the three months to April 2017, from 0.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,"" Rebecca Piggott, a research fellow at NIESR, said.
""Growth in the service sector has remained subdued, consistent with softer consumer spending growth. We expect the squeeze on household real incomes to continue as inflation accelerates throughout the year, reaching almost 3.5 percent by year end.""

Pigott said the Bank of England - which kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday - was likely to continue to tolerate the rise in inflation which has been driven in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit vote.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% last month, higher than the forecast for a 0.2% advance and compared to the 0.1% decline seen in March.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.5% in April, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.2% and following a 2.3% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, advanced by 0.4% in April, higher than forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior month’s unchanged reading.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.9% last month, in line with forecasts and compared to forecasts for a 1.7% increase and a gain of 1.6% in March.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-1 to keep rates on hold at a record low of 0.25%, in line with economists’ expectations.
Kristin Forbes, who is due to leave the BoE in June, cast the sole vote in favor of raising borrowing costs to 0.5%. The other seven members of the MPC opted to keep rates at 0.25%.
The committee voted unanimously to make no changes to its bond-buying stimulus program, in line with economists’ expectations.
The MPC was one member short, with Charlotte Hogg still to be replaced after resigning last month following her failure to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the BoE.
The bank trimmed its forecast for growth for this year, saying it now expected economic growth of 1.9%, down from 2.0% three months ago. It raised its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.7% up from 1.6% in February.
The bank now expects inflation to be 2.7% this quarter, up from the 2.4% rate it forecast in February. It said inflation would continue to rise further above its 2% target in the coming months, “peaking a little below 3% in the fourth quarter.""

The data for April, compiled by research firm Romir, cast doubt over the pace of the recovery in the Russian economy where consumer demand remains the main growth driver.
Russian consumers have borne the brunt of Russia's economic crisis as the weaker rouble drove inflation higher and ate into their purchasing power.
Inflation has fallen recently -- it was at 4.1 percent year-on-year in March, but the latest survey suggests consumer-facing sectors will continue to struggle.
""A general reduction in spending with an unchanged average bill speaks to the fact that Russians have returned to savings mode,"" Romir said in a statement.
Russia's official statistics service, Rosstat, is yet to publish data for April.
Rosstat recorded a decline in retail sales in March <RURSLY=ECI> of 0.4 percent year-on-year, nonetheless the best retail sales reading since December 2014.

Romir's survey uses data from 30,000 people in 180 Russian towns and cities with a population of over 100,000.

The Office for National Statistics also said Britain's trade deficit widened by more than expected, a further setback for hopes that the fall in the value of the pound since the European Union membership referendum would help rebalance the economy.
Industrial output fell by a monthly 0.5 percent - a sharper decline than expected by economists taking part in a Reuters poll - and output in February was revised lower.
The manufacturing sector, which is part of overall industrial output, saw output fall by 0.6 percent, compared with economists' expectations of no change.
For the first quarter as a whole, industrial output only inched up by 0.1 percent and manufacturing growth slowed to 0.3 percent.
Britain's economy has slowed this year after it initially withstood the shock of the decision by voters to leave the European Union in a referendum in June.
The slowdown and uncertainty about Britain's future relationship with the EU have added to expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their record low possibly for another two years. The BoE is due to announce its latest thinking on Britain's economy at 1100 GMT on Thursday.
Consumers, who are the main drivers of growth, have reined in their spending as inflation rises quickly, pushed up by the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound.
Some surveys have suggested that manufacturers started the year well, potentially offsetting some of the slowdown in consumer spending. But that optimism has not yet been reflected in official data.
The ONS said Thursday's figures implied no change to its preliminary estimate that Britain's economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, less than half the pace of growth at the end of 2016.
Despite the weaker start to the year for the economy, British Prime Minister Theresa May is widely expected to win comfortably a national election she has called for June 8.
Separate data from the ONS showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 13.441 billion pounds, bigger than the median forecast of 11.8 billion pounds in the Reuters poll of economists.
That took the total trade deficit - including Britain's surplus in services - for the first quarter to 10.540 billion pounds, more than double the shortfall in the fourth quarter.
Growth in exports of goods, measured in volume terms, slowed to 0.2 percent in the first quarter while import volumes jumped by 3.3 percent.
An ONS official said the widening deficit was fueled by imports of machinery and cars and by rising oil imports.
The ONS also released figures for construction output in March, which fell 0.7 percent on the month and rose 2.4 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.

Vehicle sales in China, the world's largest auto market, fell 2.2 percent to 2.1 million in April, compared to a 4 percent rise in March, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers'(CAAM) showed. The drop was the sharpest since sales fell 5 percent in August 2015, data showed.
In the first four months of the year, sales grew 4 percent, slower than the 5 percent increase forecast by the CAAM for all of 2017.
""Demand was weak and this caused stock piles in April,"" said Chen Shihua, a CAAM spokesman.
The purchase tax for cars with engines of 1.6 liter capacity or below climbed to 7.5 percent this year from 5 percent in 2016 after the government stepped in to stimulate slumping sales. The tax will rise to the normal 10 percent rate next year.
Industry executives and analysts had warned that the tax would hurt sales in early 2017.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account balance posted a stronger-than-expected surplus in March on solid income from overseas investments, maintaining a run of uninterrupted monthly surpluses that has continued for almost three years.
The surplus of 2.91 trillion yen ($25.45 billion) marked the 33rd straight month in the black, finance ministry data showed on Thursday, and beat the median forecast for a surplus of 2.643 trillion yen in a Reuters poll of economists.
Export-reliant Japan's persistent current account surpluses could elevate the thorny issue of trade imbalances with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has pledged to rework the United States' current agreements with its major trading partners.
""Usually, the current account balance shouldn't have that big of an impact, but you just never know with Trump,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""It's hard to read what, if any, effect this might have on Trump's policies (with Japan).""
The trade surplus shrank in March to 865.5 billion yen, but logged the second straight month in the black.
Income from overseas investment, boosted by a pick-up in overseas economy, also helped support the current account surplus. The primary income balance in March stood at 2.2 trillion yen on increased profits from foreign direct investment.
Japan's trade and current account surpluses have taken on critical importance as Trump pursues an ""America First"" platform, via which he has pledged to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with big exporters such as Japan.
A strong current account surplus and a large trade surplus with the United States kept Japan on the U.S. Treasury's currency watchlist released last month.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that Washington could no longer sustain inflated trade deficits with its trading partners, according to a statement issued last week by the department.
However, Japan's finance minister has said he had no discussion on trade deficits when he spoke with Ross last week.
Japan's economy has sustained a modest recovery that kicked off when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his ""Abenomics"" package of aggressive monetary, fiscal stimulus measures and structural reforms.
 A recent rebound in overseas demand has helped boost exports and output, pushing up business confidence to its highest in a year and a half.

Japan's March trade data showed exports rose at the fastest pace in more than two years as increased shipments of car parts and steel signaled that expanding overseas demand could help boost the country's notoriously slow economic growth.

For the full-text-statement, see:
Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 1.75 percent.
Global economic growth has increased and become more broad-based over recent months. However, major challenges remain with on-going surplus capacity and extensive political uncertainty.
Stronger global demand has helped to raise commodity prices over the past year, which has led to some increase in headline inflation across New Zealand’s trading partners. However, the level of core inflation has generally remained low. Monetary policy is expected to remain stimulatory in the advanced economies, but less so going forward.
The trade-weighted exchange rate has fallen by around 5 percent since February, partly in response to global developments and reduced interest rate differentials. This is encouraging and, if sustained, will help to rebalance the growth outlook towards the tradables sector.
GDP growth in the second half of 2016 was weaker than expected. Nevertheless, the growth outlook remains positive, supported by on-going accommodative monetary policy, strong population growth, and high levels of household spending and construction activity.
House price inflation has moderated further, especially in Auckland. The slowing in house price inflation partly reflects loan-to-value ratio restrictions and tighter lending conditions. This moderation is projected to continue, although there is a risk of resurgence given the continuing imbalance between supply and demand.
The increase in headline inflation in the March quarter was mainly due to higher tradables inflation, particularly petrol and food prices. These effects are temporary and may lead to some variability in headline inflation over the year ahead. Non-tradables and wage inflation remain moderate but are expected to increase gradually. This will bring future headline inflation to the midpoint of the target band over the medium term. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at around 2 percent.
Developments since the February Monetary Policy Statement on balance are considered to be neutral for the stance of monetary policy.
Monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period. Numerous uncertainties remain and policy may need to adjust accordingly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. mortgage demand to buy a home climbed to its strongest level over 1-1/2 years last week even as most mortgage rates edged higher, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.
The recent pickup in mortgage application activity for home purchase reinforced the view of underlying strength in the housing sector. An improving labor market and steady wage gains have offset the rise in interest rates since Donald Trump's U.S. presidential win in November and tight inventories nationwide, analysts said.
The Washington-based industry group said its index of mortgage applications to buy a home, a proxy for future home sales, increased 1.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis to 250.3 points in the week ended May 5. 
This was the highest level for this measure since 257.4 in the week of Oct. 2, 2015, MBA data showed.
""Home sales should be picking up as we are seeing with the purchase mortgage applications. We are going to see both new and existing home sales trending higher in the coming months,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were unchanged at 4.23 percent last week, while average mortgage rates on other types of 30-year loans MBA track were 0.03 percentage point to 0.04 percentage point higher than the prior week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
MBA said its seasonally adjusted index on conforming loan activity to buy a home rose to 316.9, which was the highest since April 2009.
Thirty-year mortgage rates rose in step with higher Treasury yield last week.
Meanwhile, MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan rose 3.3 percent to 1,345.5. 
Increases in weekly purchase and refinancing application volumes lifted MBA's seasonally adjusted index on overall mortgage activity to 415.7 points, the strongest level in eight weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices increased more than expected in April amid rising costs for petroleum products and a range of other goods, which could help boost domestic inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on course for further interest rate hikes.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday that import prices jumped 0.5 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in March. It was the fifth straight monthly increase and beat economists' expectations for a 0.2 percent advance.
""Higher import prices today helps build the case for another rate hike at the June Fed meeting as the deflation threat has long passed for this economic cycle,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
In the 12 months through April, import prices rose 4.1 percent after increasing 4.3 percent in March. Prices shot up 4.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in February, the biggest gain in five years. They are rising as the drags from a strong dollar and weak global import prices fade.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid investor caution after President Donald Trump on Tuesday abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey.
In April, prices for imported petroleum rebounded 1.6 percent after declining 0.4 percent in March. Import prices excluding petroleum gained 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since July 2016, after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month. 
Import prices excluding petroleum have now risen for four straight months, in part reflecting the dollar's 3 percent decline against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year.
Import prices excluding petroleum rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months through April, the largest increase since March 2012. The steady rise in underlying import prices could over time put upward pressure on consumer inflation.
""With job gains rebounding to decent levels, only some sudden deceleration in inflation might slow the Fed from its appointed round of rate hikes,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""Well, it doesn't look like inflation is going to decelerate anytime soon."" 
The U.S. central bank raised its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year.
Prices for imported capital goods rose for a third straight month in April, while the cost of imported motor vehicles surged 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in five years. Imported food prices increased 0.3 percent. 
The cost of goods imported from China dipped 0.1 percent last month, leading to a 1.2 percent decline on a year-on-year basis. Prices have not risen on a yearly basis since October 2014.
The report also showed export prices increased 0.2 percent in April after rising 0.1 percent in March. Prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year after increasing 3.4 percent in March.

Prices for agricultural exports advanced 0.3 percent last month as a record 37.9 percent jump in vegetable prices offset falling prices for soybeans, corn and wheat. In the 12 months through April, agricultural export prices rose 4.6 percent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's April producer price inflation cooled more than expected in a sign manufacturing activity may be losing momentum along with other sectors of the economy as domestic demand remains muted and the government cracks down on financial risks.
Prices for raw materials fell in April from the previous month, pressured by fears that domestic demand will not be strong enough to absorb surging factory output that rose the most in more than two years in March.
A renaissance in China's steel industry has been a major driver of the world's second-largest economy in recent quarters, helping generate the strongest profit growth in years and adding to a reflationary pulse across the global manufacturing sector.
But China's reflation cycle in producer prices has probably peaked, and will trend down further, which could drag on China's economic growth in the second half of the year, said Betty Wang, senior China economist for ANZ in Hong Kong.
""The recovery momentum in the economy that emerged in the second half of last year was mainly driven by producer price inflation rather than any changes from a fundamental perspective,"" Wang said.
The soft April inflation data, combined with slightly slower growth in manufacturing activity, reinforces analysts' views that China's economic expansion remains solid but is starting to moderate after a surprisingly strong start to the year.
First-quarter economic growth came in at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent, which could give the economy enough of a tailwind to hit Beijing's full-year target even if growth starts to fade in coming quarters as many analysts expect.
With growth comfortably above this year's target of around 6.5 percent, Chinese policymakers have shifted focus to reining in financial risks, which ANZ's Wang said will not change based on trends in producer and consumer prices.
""Deleveraging remains the policy focus, regardless of the PPI or CPI trend. We don't think PPI or CPI will have any significant impact on the current policy direction,"" said Wang.
The producer price index (PPI) in April rose 6.4 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday - cooling for the second month in a row. It was slower than economists' expectations for a 6.9 percent rise and easing further from the previous month's gain of 7.6 percent.
Analysts said the rally in producer prices may have peaked as a torrid rally in China's commodities markets showed signs of correcting. Iron ore and steel hit multi-month lows on China's future markets in April amid concern over rising inventories.
Capital Economics said in a report that producer prices were set to fall again in May given that the rout in industrial commodity prices had deepened.
""Further ahead, producer price inflation should continue to wane as policy tightening weighs on economic activity...hopes for a sustained reflation in China are fading.""
On a month-on-month basis, producer prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the first drop since June, led by declines in iron and steel smelting and processing.
Iron and steel processing prices fell 3.1 percent month-on-month in April, compared with a 2.3 percent rise in March, while oil and natural gas prices also fell after rising the previous months.
In March, China's PPI cooled for the first time in seven months as commodities prices tumbled, pressured by fears that Chinese steel production is outweighing demand and threatening a glut of the metal later this year.
Factory gate prices had only turned positive on a year-on-year basis last September, after falling for nearly five years, leaving many industrial firms saddled with idle capacity and less cash flow to service their debts.
The consumer price index (CPI) in April rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said, up from a 0.9 percent rise in March and slightly above analysts' forecasts.
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index (CPI), fell 3.5 percent.
Core inflation inched up to 2.1 percent, with costs for health care rising 5.7 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted April consumer price inflation would edge up to 1.1 percent but remain well within the central bank's comfort zone, giving it room to continue with a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening without hurting economic growth.
China's annual inflation is to average 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.3 percent in 2018, according to a Reuters poll of over 75 economists.
Beijing is targeting consumer inflation of 3 percent this year, unchanged from 2016.
Chinese President Xi Jinping called last month for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

Auto inventories increased 1.9 percent. Wholesale stocks of electrical goods surged 2.3 percent, the biggest gain since January 2015. Professional equipment inventories rose 1.0 percent in March.

Residential building permits slumped 8.4 percent due to a 20.9 percent drop in construction plans for multifamily buildings, which include apartments, condominiums and townhouses. The biggest declines were in Ontario and British Columbia, which have both had strong housing markets.
By contrast, plans to build single-family homes increased 3.0 percent, led by Ontario. A lack of supply has been partly blamed for the surge in home prices in Toronto.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production fell by less than expected in March and trade proved resilient, data showed on Tuesday, supporting robust growth expectations for the first quarter.
The reports followed by a day data showing Germany industrial orders rose for the second consecutive month in March, the first time since 2015.
Germany's quarterly economic growth, to be released on Friday, is now expected to pick up to 0.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year.
Industrial output edged down by 0.4 percent on the month, Tuesday's data from the Economy Ministry showed. This was better than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a drop of 0.6 percent.
The decline was driven by a 2.5 percent fall in energy output. Manufacturing production was down 0.5 percent while construction output rose 1.5 percent.
The February reading was revised down to a rise of 1.8 percent from a previously reported increase of 2.2 percent. In January, industrial production rose by 1.3 percent.
In the first quarter as a whole, industrial production rose 1.4 percent on the quarter, the ministry said.
The Economy Ministry said the industrial upswing in the first quarter had momentum. ""Industrial orders and sentiment indicators suggest a continuation of this positive trend,"" it said.
""All in all, despite the small drop in March, industrial production should have returned as a growth driver for the German economy,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
While construction remains a strong source of economic growth, industrial production and investments are set to finally catch up with the rest of the economy, he added.
Separate data released from the Federal Statistics Office showed that seasonally adjusted exports rose by 0.4 percent on the month to hit a record high of 105.4 billion euros. This came in better than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.2 percent.
Imports jumped by 2.4 percent also to hit the highest value recorded in a month of 85.8 billion euros. This was much stronger than a predicted increase of 1.0 percent.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.6 billion euros ($21.41 billion) from a revised 21.2 billion euros in February, below the Reuters consensus forecast of 20.9 billion euros.
""Germany is clearly benefitting at the moment from the revival of the global economy. And Germany still seems to have the right products, such as cars and machines, which are in demand all over the world,"" Sal. Oppenheim analyst Ulrike Kastens said. ""But these good figures will increase the pressure on Germany to reduce the high trade and current account surpluses.""
The overall robust readouts were the latest in a batch of solid economic figures and will help center-right Chancellor Angela Merkel burnish her economic credentials ahead of a Sept. 24 federal election, when she will seek a fourth term.
The figures also underline the strength of the economy compared to its peers. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has urged Merkel's conservatives to adopt a less rigid stance in fiscal policy towards France after the election of the pro-reform centrist Emmanuel Macron as president.

The wages figures back recent data showing household spending fell more than expected and core consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace in March, suggesting an exit from the central bank's radical quantitative easing program remains distant.
Inflation-adjusted real wages dropped 0.8 percent in March from a year earlier to mark their biggest rate of decline since June 2015, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday.
In nominal terms, wage earners' cash earnings fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in March, also notching the biggest rate of decrease since June 2015.
The data underscores the fragile and patchy nature of Japan's economic recovery. It also bodes ill for Abe, who has repeatedly urged companies to lift worker compensation to foster sustainable growth in the world's third-largest economy through a virtuous cycle of increased household spending, higher business investment and production.
The drop in March nominal cash earnings and real wages partly reflected a pullback from the same period a year earlier, when wage growth was solid, a labor ministry official said. In March 2016, nominal cash earnings rose 1.5 percent on-year and real wages increased 1.6 percent.
""We need to look at the data for April onward. We can't say by looking at just this month that the trend (in wage growth) has shifted,"" the official said.
Businesses have been reluctant to raise wages despite a tight labor market. An overwhelming majority of Japanese companies said they will raise wages at a slower pace than they did last year, a Reuters poll found.
Regular pay, which determines base salaries, dipped an annual 0.1 percent, falling for the first time since May last year.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, fell 1.7 percent in March from a year earlier.
Special payments, such as bonuses, fell 3.6 percent in March on-year, also marking the largest drop since June 2015.
Special payments are generally small, so even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes.

Total retail sales showed their strongest year-on-year growth in six years in April, but the jump largely reflected the timing of the Easter holiday which fell in March last year but in April in 2017, the British Retail Consortium said.
Rising prices for goods in shops - pushed up in many cases by a fall in the value of the pound - were also a factor behind the 6.3 percent increase in the value of sales, it said.
""Looking to the longer-term signs of a slowdown, the outlook isn't as rosy,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.
Consumers were focusing increasingly on saving money by buying cheaper, own-label brands from supermarkets and were being more cautious about non-food spending, she said.
On a like-for-like basis - which excludes new store openings - sales were up by 5.6 percent in April compared with the same month last year, the BRC said.
Britain's economy initially held up well to the shock of last June's referendum decision to leave the EU.
But inflation is rising quickly and wage growth has weakened, raising questions about how long consumers can continue to drive growth going forward.
In the first three months of this year, the economy expanded at half the pace of the last quarter of 2016, an awkward economic backdrop for Prime Minister Theresa May who nonetheless seems headed for victory in a national election on June 8.
Credit card firm Barclaycard painted a similar picture to BRC, saying sales were up an annual 5.5 percent in April, but two thirds of respondents in its survey said they were focusing on value for money. It reported a 16.6 percent rise in spending in discount stores.
Barclaycard said a rise of 11.4 percent of spending on essential items - the strongest growth seen since Barclaycard began compiling data in 2012 - was partly due to Easter and by spending on fuel, which jumped 14.7 percent.
Separately on Tuesday, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said employers saw the sharpest fall in the availability of workers to fill their vacancies in 16 months.
Recruitment companies reported a drop in the number of European Union nationals available to work in sectors such as food manufacturing and healthcare, REC said.
""The weakening pound and lack of clarity about future immigration rules is putting off some EU nationals from taking up roles in the UK,"" REC Chief Executive Kevin Green said.
Official data published in February showed that a steady rise in the number of EU migrants working in Britain stalled at the end of 2016, raising concerns among employers that they would struggle to fill vacancies.

The REC survey also showed the slowest increase in permanent placements by recruitment firms in seven months and growth in starting wages edged down to a four month low. By contrast hirings and pay for temporary workers picked up speed.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation rate in April likely eased to its lowest level in nearly 10 years, which could help prod the central bank to make another steep interest rate cut this month, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. 
The IPCA benchmark consumer price index was seen rising 4.10 percent in the 12 months through the end of April compared with a 4.41 percent increase in the year to the middle of the month, according to the median estimate of 26 economists surveyed. The data is due to be released on Wednesday.
Brazilian annual inflation has tumbled from a 12-year peak of 10.7 percent in January 2016 amid slack consumer demand stemming from a severe recession and the highest unemployment on record.
President Michel Temer has hailed the drop in inflation as evidence that his austerity agenda was putting Latin America's largest economy on a solid footing for recovery.
As inflationary pressures have eased, the central bank has steadily cut its benchmark interest rate from 14.25 percent in October. 
Last month, it slashed it by 100 basis points, taking it to 11.25 percent. It was the deepest cut to the rate in nearly eight years.
""The (inflation) numbers should strengthen the case for another 100 basis point cut this month,"" said Leonardo Costa, an economist with the São Paulo-based consultancy Rosenberg & Associados. 
On Monday, a central bank survey of economists forecast a central bank interest rate of 8.5 percent and 4 percent annual inflation by December.
In the month of April, consumer prices were expected to have increased 0.16 percent from March, slowing from a 0.25 percent rise in the previous month, according to the median of 28 forecasts in the Reuters poll. 
Forecasts for the monthly inflation rate ranged between 0.12 percent and 0.27 percent, while estimates for the 12-month rate varied between 4.07 percent and 4.22 percent.
Housing and transportation prices probably fell in April, while education costs slowed their increase, according to economists in the Reuters poll. 

A one-off cut in electricity rates also likely contributed to last month's anticipated inflation slowdown, as the government reversed a tariff surcharge related to the Angra 3 nuclear power plant, economists said. The central bank, however, said last month that this drop, however sizable, should not have relevant implications for monetary policy.

The survey of consumer expectations, one of several gauges of prices for the U.S. central bank, showed median inflation expectations for one year ahead edged up to 2.8 percent in April, from 2.7 percent in March. The three-year measure was 2.9 percent, compared to 2.7 percent a month earlier. 
The bump, which the New York Fed said was driven by those with lower income and education, keeps the price measures roughly in a range since late last year.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice since December in large part on expectations that inflation will keep edging higher.
The survey also showed median household spending growth expectations dropped to 2.6 percent last month, from 3.3 percent in March. It was the lowest level since the New York Fed began measuring in mid-2013.

The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of 1,200 household heads.

BERLIN (Reuters) - High demand from abroad boosted German industrial orders in March, data showed on Monday, a second-in-a-row rise analysts saw as a sign the sector is overcoming past volatility and will contribute to growth in coming months.
Contracts for ""Made in Germany"" goods were up by 1 percent on the month, the Economy Ministry said, the first time since November 2015 that new orders increased for two months in a row.
""Combined with buoyant confidence indicators today's new orders data suggest that industrial production could finally gather some momentum,"" ING Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said in a note to clients.
""There is increasing evidence that contrary to previous cycles industrial production could be the lagging factor of the current positive economic expansion,"" he added.
The March figure was on a par with the Reuters consensus forecast and followed an upwardly revised rise of 3.5 percent in February. In January orders fell by 6.8 percent.
A breakdown of the March data showed domestic demand fell by 3.8 percent and foreign orders were up by 4.8 percent, with bookings from euro zone countries rising by 6.8 percent.
The euro zone has been revived by the European Central Bank's expansive monetary policy, and that recovery is good news for German exporters. 
""Demand for exports is becoming buoyant, supported above all by a positive development in the euro zone,"" said Sophia Krietenbrink of the DIHK Chambers of Commerce.
Highlighting the importance of the euro zone to Germany, German business associations and economists on Monday welcomed the election of pro-European Union politician Emmanuel Macron as president in France, Germany's second most important trading partner after China.
""There is a big relief in the engineering industry that the pro-European camp has prevailed in France,"" said Carl Martin Welcker, president of the VDMA engineering association.
""With Macron, Germany has won a partner to advance necessary reforms together in the EU.""
The BDI industry association also welcomed Macron's victory over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who had threatened to pull France out of the EU.
Germany wants France and other euro zone economies to implement painful reforms that would make them more competitive. Euro zone peers want Germany to boost investments, which would reduce it big current account surplus.
The German economy is expected to grow 1.5 percent this year. Quarterly growth is expected to nearly double to 0.7 percent in the first quarter from 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year. 

Preliminary first quarter growth data is due on Friday.

Beijing (Reuters) - China's import growth slowed faster than expected in April, as inbound shipments of commodities such as iron ore and copper weakened, while export growth more than halved, in line with a general cooling in demand for electronic gadgets.
China's April imports rose 11.9 percent, cooling from March's 20.3 percent rise, official data showed on Monday, and missing analysts' expectations for an 18 percent rise.
Exports rose 8.0 percent from a year earlier, slowing from a 16.4 percent rise in the previous month and short of expectations of 10.4 percent.
While the data shows trade remained robust at the beginning of the second quarter, analysts say the spurt in China's economic growth seen in the first three months of the year may be as good as it gets as policymakers seek to tighten speculative investment, especially in the property sector.
""Looking ahead, we expect export growth to hold up well given the relatively bright outlook for the global economy this year,"" Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""Growth in inbound shipments will continue to face headwinds, however. In particular, policy tightening will further weigh on domestic demand in coming quarters.""
April's numbers left the country with a trade surplus of $38.05 billion, which compared with forecasts for $35.50 billion, and above $23.93 billion in March. The April trade figures are preliminary, with revised data due on May 23. 
China's imports of crude oil, iron ore and copper all fell by volume compared with March, with the data in line with a recent survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector showing April expansion was the slowest in six months.
Despite the slowdown, imports year-to-date are still up 20.8 percent by value, compared with 8.1 percent growth for exports over the first four months, though analysts say imports could slow further this year.
While China's economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, policymakers have moved to reduce financial risks in the economy and stamp out speculative activity in the property market.
Commodity imports have also been hit by falling prices, with iron ore and steel hitting multi-month lows on China's future markets in April amid concern over rising inventories. China's producer price inflation slowed in March for the first time in seven months, with price gains expected to continue to cool.
Exports of electronics and machinery products increased 2 percent year-on-year in April, customs data showed, slowing from 12.3 percent growth in March. 
FRICTION
China's surplus with the United States widened in April, meaning pressure from the U.S. for action on the trade imbalance is not likely to go away anytime soon.
The surplus with the U.S. was $21.34 billion in April, up from $17.74 billion in March and higher than the year-ago period, according to data from China's customs bureau. 
Exports to the United States, China's largest export market, rose 11.7 percent in April from a year earlier while imports from the U.S. rose 1.5 percent. 
China's large trade surplus with the United States has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.
While the U.S. Treasury Department did not label China a currency manipulator in its most recent report on currency manipulation, the Trump administration has sought other fronts in which to tackle its large trade deficit with Beijing.
Last month, Trump launched a trade probe against China and other exporters of cheap steel into the U.S. market.
And the U.S. Commerce Department said last Tuesday it would open investigations into possible dumping and subsidization of imports of tool chests and cabinets from China and Vietnam.
As Trump moves to put America's interest first and pull out of multilateral trade agreements, China has positioned itself as a supporter of free trade.
Finance leaders of Japan, China and South Korea last week agreed to resist all forms of protectionism in a trilateral meeting, taking a stronger stand than major G20 economies against the protectionist policies advocated by Trump.
While trade friction between China and some key trading partners remains, an overall improvement in global growth means shipments from the world's largest exporter will likely remain strong this year. 
China's imports and exports are expected to stabilize and improve in the near future, the Ministry of Commerce said last week in its quarterly report on trends in the country's foreign trade.

Foreign trade is expected to face a better environment in 2017 compared with the past two years, the commerce ministry report said.

996,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2017 08:00PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth rebounds sharply, unemployment rate falls to 4.4 percent","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in April and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.4 percent, near a 10-year low, pointing to a tightening labor market that likely seals the case for an interest rate increase next month despite moderate wage growth.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 211,000 jobs last month after a paltry gain of 79,000 in March, the Labor Department said on Friday. April's job growth, which was broad-based, surpassed this year's monthly average of 185,000.
There were hefty increases in leisure and hospitality, healthcare and social assistance as well as business and professional services payrolls.
The drop of one-tenth of a percentage point in the jobless rate took it to its lowest level since May 2007 and well below the most recent Federal Reserve median forecast for full employment.
""These developments should keep the Fed firmly on track to hike rates again in June and should motivate a hawkish shift in the interest rate forecasts they will release at that meeting,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The hiring rebound supports the U.S. central bank's contention that the pedestrian 0.7 percent annualized economic growth pace in the first quarter was likely ""transitory,"" and its optimism that economic activity would expand at a ""moderate"" pace.
The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it expected labor market conditions would ""strengthen somewhat further."" It raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year.
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 83 percent probability of a 25-basis-point rate increase at the Fed's June 13-14 policy meeting, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch program.
Prices of benchmark U.S. Treasuries rose modestly on Friday, while U.S. stocks closed higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) ending at a record high close. The dollar (DXY) fell marginally against a basket of currencies as investors turned their attention to the second round of France's presidential election on Sunday.
WAGE GROWTH LAGS
The U.S. economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
Republican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has vowed to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation.
Trump later hailed the numbers in a tweet: ""Great jobs report today - It is all beginning to work!""
In April, average hourly earnings rose 7 cents, or 0.3 percent. However, downward revisions to previous months lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.5 percent, the smallest gain since August 2016, from 2.6 percent in March.
But there are signs wage growth is accelerating as labor market slack diminishes. A government report last week showed private-sector wages recorded their biggest gain in 10 years in the first quarter.
With the labor market expected to hit a level consistent with full employment this year, payroll gains could slow amid growing anecdotal evidence that firms are struggling to find qualified workers. That could also boost wages.
""While there is still some labor market slack, it is diminishing rapidly. This is likely to put upward pressure on wages,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio.
A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people whowant to work but have given up searching and those workingpart-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.6 percent, the lowest level since November 2007.
The employment-to-population ratio rose one-tenth of percentage point to an eight-year high of 60.2 percent. This measure has risen for four straight months.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell to 62.9 percent from an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. It has rebounded from a multi-decade low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, and economists see limited room for further improvement as the pool of discouraged workers shrinks.
Construction payrolls rose by 5,000 last month and manufacturing payrolls increased by 6,000. Leisure and hospitality payrolls jumped by 55,000 in April. Professional and business services payrolls rose by 39,000. Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 36,800.
Retail payrolls gained 6,300 after two straight months of declines. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), Macy's Inc (N:M) and Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations.
Government payrolls jumped by 17,000 last month as an increase in hiring by local governments offset a decline in federal government employment.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 211,000 in April, compared to the rise of 79,000 a month earlier that was revised from the initial increase of 98,000. The data beat the consensus estimate for the creation of 185,000 jobs.

Additionally, the private sector created more of the new job contracts than expected in April with a total of 194,000, compared to consensus expectations for 185,000. March’s number was revised down to 77,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 89,000.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2017 03:21AM ET</span>",Indonesia's first-quarter GDP growth edges up on higher exports,"By Nilufar Rizki and Hidayat Setiaji
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's economic growth picked up a touch in the first quarter on firmer export prices of some commodities and stronger demand in major trading partners, though analysts were split on how far this momentum will carry through to the rest of the year. 
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 5.01 percent in the January-March period on an annual basis, the statistics bureau said on Friday, matching a Reuters poll and up slightly from 4.94 percent in the preceding quarter.
The resource-rich country has struggled through years of slowing growth as a plunge in commodity prices hurt everything from exports to investment and people's purchasing power. 
The recovery in prices of some of Indonesia's main commodities, such as palm oil and coal, helped economic growth pick up to 5.02 percent last year, from 4.79 percent in 2015.
In the first quarter, exports of goods and services rose more than 8 percent. The head of the statistics bureau Suhariyanto attributed this to rising prices of commodities such as tea and shrimp. Demand was also supported by slightly better economic growth in China, the United States and Singapore - Indonesia's major trading partners.
""This is promising and in line with growth in our export partners,"" Suhariyanto told a briefing.
Consultancy Capital Economics described the first-quarter performance as disappointing and Natwest Markets said it was sub-potential.
But  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and local brokerage Samuel Sekuritas were more upbeat and suggested it pointed to a better reading in coming quarters.
""It was an external driven recovery in line with our expectation. We see growth improving in the future as the government spends more,"" said Standard Chartered economist Aldian Taloputra, who expects export gains to feed through to investment and consumption. 
Standard Chartered expects the economy to grow 5.3 percent this year.
Capital Economics maintained its view that growth will likely remain stuck at around 5 percent over the next couple of years, with senior Asia economist Gareth Leather citing relatively depressed commodity prices and soft credit growth.
During the first three months, growth of private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Indonesia's gross domestic product, slowed slightly, while investment remained sluggish.
But after lower state spending in the second half of 2016 had dragged on growth, the government increased spending in the first quarter.
Indonesia's finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters last month there would be no more spending cuts this year as revenue-collection was on track and 2017 GDP growth was likely to top the official target of 5.1 percent.
Meanwhile, the mining sector swung back to contraction after growing for a few quarters, due to a decline in production at big miners like PT Freeport Indonesia and Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, as well as lower oil and gas output.
Improving growth in other major sectors like agriculture and manufacturing helped compensate for the mining contraction.
Most economists in a Reuters poll on monetary policy believe the central bank is unlikely to support the economy with more rate cuts this year, having cut six times last year.

""The momentum to cut is constrained by rising inflation,"" said Myrtal Gunarto, Maybank Indonesia's economist. The central bank next meets for a policy review on May 17-18.

Exports in March rose 24.1 percent from a year earlier, beating economists' forecast of a 19.2 percent rise, but were down slightly from the 26.5 percent increase recorded in February, the fastest annual pace in nearly seven years. 
Data from the International Trade and Industry Ministry showed a new milestone in export performance, with shipments topping 80 billion ringgit ($18.46 billion) for the first time. 
Exports of manufactured products grew 22.1 percent year-on-year, the data showed, while shipments of mining goods jumped 36.1 percent on higher volumes and prices of crude oil and liquefied natural gas.

March imports jumped 39.4 percent from a year earlier, the highest annual increase in seven years, and up from the 27.7 percent increase recorded the previous month. 
The trade surplus in March narrowed to 5.4 billion ringgit ($1.25 billion), from February's 8.7 billion ringgit. 
Exports to China jumped 40.3 percent from a year earlier, due to higher shipments of petroleum products, electrical and electronic products, rubber and chemicals.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2017 12:37PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; productivity drops in first quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell sharply last week and the number of Americans on unemployment rolls hit a 17-year low, pointing to a tightening labor market that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
Diminishing job market slack has left companies scrambling for workers as they seek to shore up weak productivity, leading to a rise in labor costs. Other data on Thursday showed worker productivity falling in the first quarter.
""The tightening labor market is raising costs but firms are failing to improve productivity to offset those increases,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There simply is no reserve army of the unemployed or underemployed to call on and hours worked are already fairly high."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 for the week ended April 29, the Labor Department said. The decline unwound most of the prior two weeks' increases, which economists had blamed on volatility arising from the different timings of the Easter holidays and spring breaks.
The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it expected labor market conditions would ""strengthen somewhat further."" Officials at the U.S. central bank also viewed the pedestrian 0.7 percent annualized economic growth pace in the first quarter as likely ""transitory"" and expected economic activity to expand at a ""moderate"" pace. 
Most economists expect a rate hike in June. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 113 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 23,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended April 22, the lowest level since April 2000. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street also were lower. 
LOW LAYOFFS
Last week's claims report has no bearing on April's employment report due on Friday as it falls outside the survey period. Claims were low in April compared to March. A separate report from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday showed U.S.-based employers announced 36,602 job cuts in April, down 15 percent from March. 
The layoffs were concentrated in the retail sector, which has been hit by store closures amid stiff competition from online retailers. According to a Reuters survey of economists, job growth likely rebounded 185,000 following March's paltry 98,000 gain, which was the smallest in 10 months. 
In another report, the Labor Department said productivity decreased at a 0.6 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the weakest in a year, after rising at a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. It increased at a 1.1 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Productivity has increased at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent over the last five years, well below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016. Weak productivity suggests economic growth is likely to remain moderate.
""The (Trump) administration is looking for 3 percent trend real GDP growth and, given the demographic effects of an aging population on the workforce, such an outcome would require productivity growth to be significantly above its long-run trend for a decade,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
With productivity soft, unit labor costs jumped at a 3.0 percent pace in the first quarter after rising at a 1.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. They increased at a 2.8 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed the trade gap dipped 0.1 percent to $43.7 billion in March as both imports and exports fell, signaling slackening domestic and global demand. 

In another report, the department said new orders for U.S.-made goods increased for a fourth straight month in March and orders for capital equipment were stronger than previously reported, suggesting a sustained recovery in the manufacturing sector.

Lower interest rates, an expected economic rebound, higher consumption and political reforms were listed by Markit as drivers of higher confidence among service providers.
Brazil's central bank slashed interest rates from 14.25 percent last year to 11.25 percent last month and is expected to keep cutting to 8.5 percent by December as inflation subsides.
In Congress, lawmakers are expected to approve easier labor rules and stricter limits to pension spending in coming months.

Improving activity helped service providers reduce the pace of job cuts to the slowest since August 2015, Markit added. Incoming new work grew for a third straight month.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap dipped 0.1 percent to $43.7 billion. February's trade deficit was revised up to $43.8 billion from $43.6 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap rising to $44.5 billion in March.

President Donald Trump told Reuters that he was ""psyched"" to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, but changed his mind after their leaders asked for it to be renegotiated instead.
NAFTA which was signed in 1994 by the United States, Canada and Mexico removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by just 10,000 to 247,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended April 22 unexpectedly fell to 1.964 million from 1.987 million in the preceding week which was revised down from an initial reading of 1.988 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.000 million.
The four-week moving average was 243,000, a rise of 750 from the previous week's revised reading of 242,250.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The restrictions, on flights from predominantly Middle East countries, were brought in by U.S. and British authorities in late March.
However, traffic growth at the Middle East carriers slowed to 4.9 percent in March, against 9.5 percent in February as the low oil price took its toll on demand.
""This is related more to developments seen last year, while any impacts from the laptop ban will be visible from April results onward,"" IATA said in a statement.

Globally, capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 6.1 percent, slower than demand. That meant load factors - a measure of how full planes are - increased 0.5 percentage points to 80.4 percent, which IATA said was a record for the month of March.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2017 05:50AM ET</span>","UK services firms surprise with bounce, homebuyers cautious","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy picked up some steam in April after slowing in early 2017, a closely-watched survey suggested on Thursday, welcome news for Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of a national election in just over a month's time.
But separate figures from the Bank of England showed caution on the part of house-buyers in March, adding to signs of a slowdown in the housing market as rising inflation squeezes consumers.
The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of Britain's giant services industry unexpectedly rose to a four-month high of 55.8 in April, above all the forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The reading was the second strongest since mid-2015, a good backdrop for May and her Conservative Party who are trying to convince voters that the opposition Labour Party cannot be trusted to run the economy after the June 8 election.
At the same time, the survey included some warning signs for the economy, which has so far coped with the shock of last June's Brexit vote much better than expected by the Bank of England and private-sector economists before the referendum.
Prices charged by service firms rose at the fastest pace since July 2008 and company executives reined in their optimism about the year ahead for a third month in a row.
Taken with PMIs for manufacturing and construction published this week, the April survey suggested the economy was growing at a quarterly pace of 0.6 percent at the start of the second quarter, Markit said, double the pace of the first quarter.
IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said that kind of momentum was unlikely to last as households increasingly felt the pinch from rising inflation.
""We expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses,"" Williamson said.
However, he said growth of at least 0.4 percent growth was possible for the second quarter as a whole.
The BoE data painted a mixed picture of how consumers are coping with the rise in inflation triggered by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote and by rising global oil prices.
Consumer credit in the 12 months to March grew by 10.2 percent, the weakest increase since July of last year. But on the month it picked up a bit up of speed to rise by 1.624 billion pounds ($2.09 billion), more than the increase of 1.3 billion pounds expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
British clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) lowered its full-year profit guidance on Thursday after cash-strapped shoppers stayed away from its stores in the first quarter.
The Bank of England's top policymakers will pay close attention to Thursday's readings of the economy as they prepare for next week's monetary policy announcement.
The BoE is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low throughout this year and possibly until 2019 as it steers the British economy through the uncertainty linked to the exit from the European Union.

One rate-setter voted last month for a rate increase, however, and others said they might follow suit soon if there were signs that economy was maintaining its momentum of 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses started the second quarter by turning out their best performance in six years, according to a survey on Thursday which suggested the
bloc's economic recovery is broadly based and sustainable.
Activity expanded slightly faster than earlier predicted and survey compiler IHS Markit said the data was consistent with a GDP growth rate of 0.7 percent. Official numbers on Friday showed the bloc far outpaced the United States last quarter.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), regarded as a good guide to growth, rose to a six-year high of 56.8 in April from March's 56.4. An earlier flash reading had suggested a shallower rise to 56.7.
""The PMI surveys portray an economy that is growing at an
encouragingly robust pace and that risks are moving from the downside to a more balanced situation,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Earlier PMI surveys covering the bloc's four biggest
economies showed growth remained strong in Germany and France and accelerated in Spain and Italy.
Pointing to continued solid expansion this month, new
business growth in April was only slightly weaker than the six-year high set in March. The euro zone composite sub-index dipped to 55.9 from 56.2.
Matching an impressive performance reported by manufacturers earlier this week, firms in the bloc's dominant service industry also said growth was at a six-year high. [EUR/PMIM]
The services PMI rose to 56.4 from 56.0. That beat the flash estimate of 56.2 and was the highest since April 2011.
The increase in activity came despite firms raising prices again, albeit at a weaker rate than in March. The services output price sub-index dipped to 51.7 from 52.2, which was a near six-year high.
Official data on Friday showed inflation rose more than
expected in April, returning to the European Central Bank's target, but the ECB kept its policy stance steady last week, even leaving the door open to more easing.
But with growth and inflation stronger, pressure is mounting on the ECB to start dialling back its lavish stimulus.
""The encouraging picture from the survey data is likely to help raise many forecasters' expectations of euro zone economic growth in 2017, and will also no doubt add to speculation that ECB rhetoric will turn increasingly hawkish,"" Williamson said.

The Investec Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)climbed to 61.1 in April from 59.1 in March, its highest
level since last June, the month in which neighboring Britain voted to leave the European Union.
The manufacturing PMI for March, released earlier this week, rose to a three-month high of 55.0 as new export orders came in at the fastest pace in almost two years.
""Taken together, this week's reports suggest that economic activity in Ireland picked up at the beginning of Q2,"" Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O'Sullivan said.
Growth in Ireland's services and manufacturing sectors
slowed after the shock Brexit vote, and readings have been volatile since.
But Ireland last year remained the best performing economy in the EU for the third year in a row. Services have not fallen below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since June 2012, when Ireland was halfway through a three-year international bailout.
New orders in the services sector increased in April, but
new export orders were the lowest since December, the survey showed. New export orders in the period were driven by Europe and North America, the authors said.
""Irish services companies remain strongly optimistic, with more than 10 times as many firms expecting to record growth in activity over the coming 12 months as opposed to those who anticipate a decline,"" O'Sullivan added.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.8 last month from a reading of 55.0 in March. That was its ninth consecutive month of expansion and its highest level since December 2016.
Analysts had expected the index to inch up to 54.5.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Apart from the sharpest rise in business activity since December, Markit indicated that new work and employment levels also expanded at the fastest pace so far in 2017.
With regard to inflation, the research group said that average prices charged saw their fastest increase since July 2008.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson pointed out the service sector data combines with the positive surveys for both the manufacturing and construction sectors pointed to economic growth of 0.6% at the start of the second quarter.
“While we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there’s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter,” he said.
Williamson noted with regard to inflation that the price increases were widely attributed to the need to past increased costs, widely related to more expensive imports via the weaker pound, on to consumers.
This expert interpreted the data as leading to a further increase in consumer price inflation.
“The strengthening of growth and the upturn in prices will bolster calls for higher interest rates,” Williamson remarked.
“But weak growth in the consumer sector remains a concern, and is something which could intensify in coming months as consumer prices rise further,” he concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2888 from around 1.2891 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8474 from 0.8465 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 145.44 compared to 145.42 previously.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.5 from March's 52.2, the fourth monthly decline in a row and suggesting the sector grew at its weakest pace since May 2016.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI also pointed to a loss of growth momentum for the month, falling to 51.2, its lowest since June 2016, from 52.1 in March.
The findings echoed a similar trend of slowing growth seen in China's official factory and services surveys on Sunday, though the Caixin surveys have a smaller sample size and largely focus on small- and medium-sized firms.
Analysts have predicted China's economy would slowly lose steam in coming months after a strong first quarter, when it expanded by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent.
Momentum is expected to cool as authorities step up their battle to cool the overheated property sector and as the central bank and other regulators tighten credit conditions to rein in rising financial risks.
""A turning point in growth appeared to have emerged at the beginning of the second quarter. Investors should be cautious about downward risks in the economy,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group in a note accompanying the data.
Some business people also have told Reuters recently that they are worried about more limited access to credit and higher borrowing costs this year.
BUSINESS LESS OPTIMISTIC
Services companies remained generally optimistic that business activity will increase over the next year, according to the Caixin survey. But the degree of positive sentiment slipped to a five-month low and job creation slowed to its lowest so far this year.
While the new business sub-component rebounded to 53.0 in April, the survey noted only 13 percent of companies surveyed reported higher new orders.
Cost pressures also eased somewhat, as input prices rose at a slower pace and firms continued to pass on some of the costs to customers.
China is counting on an increase in domestic consumption and new technologies to diversify its economic growth model from its traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth while emphasizing the strength of the labor market, in a sign it was still on track for two more rate rises this year.
In a bullish statement following the end of a two-day policy meeting, the central bank also said consumer spending continued to be solid, business investment had firmed and inflation has been ""running close"" to the Fed's target.
""The committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory,"" the Fed said in a unanimous statement.
The labor market continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed and ""the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid,"" policymakers added.
The Fed raised its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point at its last meeting in March to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent.
Before this week's meeting most Fed policymakers had made it clear that in contrast to previous years the central bank feels more confident in its forecast of two more rate increases in 2017.
Wednesday's affirmation from the Fed that it was optimistic on economic growth and that its rate rise plans remained intact bolstered the dollar against the euro and yen and pushed Treasury yields slightly higher.
""They went out of their way to emphasize this is not something they see persisting and pretty much says to me that their two rate hikes are still on the table for the balance of the year,"" said Heidi Learner, chief economist at Savills Studley.
NORMALIZING RATES
The Fed is in its first tightening cycle in more than a decade after it spent years keeping rates near zero to nurse the economy back to health following the 2007-2009 recession.
Policymakers have been buoyed by recent economic data that showed a surge in business investment and the fastest wage growth in a decade. The unemployment rate also fell in March to near a 10-year low.
However, some officials had also said they wanted more data in hand before taking additional steps to normalize rates. Gross domestic product grew at a sluggish 0.7 percent annual pace in the first quarter as consumer spending almost stalled. Job growth also slowed sharply in March.
Economists have largely attributed the weak first-quarter GDP reading to recurring issues with the calculation of growth during the January-March period and linked the pullback in hiring to weather.
Policymakers are awaiting clarity on the size and scope of the tax cuts, infrastructure spending and regulatory changes that the Trump administration will be able to push through Congress. A stimulus package could speed up the pace of rate hikes.
Inflation had been edging higher, but the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, the smallest gain since last July. Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is below its target.
The Fed in its statement showed little concern about a softening in inflation, characterizing it as ""running close to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.""
The rate-setting committee is also gearing up to announce sometime this year when and how the Fed will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Wednesday's statement offered no new details.

Fed officials will hold their next policy meeting on June 13-14.

(Reuters) - U.S. companies hired workers at a slower but still-solid pace in April, while the domestic services sector grew more than expected, supporting the notion the economic expansion remains on track despite a weak first quarter, private data released on Wednesday showed.
An improving labor market and faster activity in services industries last month also buttressed traders' expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates further in the coming months.
""In short, more evidence that the underlying trend in growth is not suddenly slowing, as suggested by the GDP data. If anything, the trend appears to be up, not down,"" High Frequency Economics Chief U.S. Economist Jim O'Sullivan wrote in a research note.
Last week, the government said gross domestic product increased 0.7 percent in the first quarter, the weakest pace in three years.
Payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday private employers added 177,000 jobs last month. It was the smallest gain since the 62,000 increase last October but slightly above the 175,000 median forecast among economists polled by Reuters.
Private payroll gains for March were revised down to 255,000 from an originally reported 263,000 increase. 
ADP, which jointly developed its employment report with Moody's Analytics, said private employers face increasing difficulty finding qualified workers in a tightening labor market. 
The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the current range of 0.75-1.00 percent at its policy meeting that will conclude later Wednesday. 
Traders expect the Fed's policy-setting group will hike rates by a quarter point at its next meeting on June 13-14. 
U.S. financial markets brushed off the latest data as investors await the Fed's upcoming rate decision. Major stock indexes and U.S. bond yields were lower, while the dollar strengthened slightly.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. private payroll employment likely grew by 185,000 jobs in April, up from 89,000 in March, while the jobless rate likely ticked up to 4.6 percent from the 4.5 percent in March.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy started the year with robust growth that outstripped that of the United States and set the stage for a strong 2017, preliminary estimates showed on Wednesday.
The improving economy may weaken the euroskeptic parties that have gained ground in several European Union states over the past years, many of which have denounced the poor state of their economies and called for ditching the euro and returning to national currencies.
The gross domestic product of the 19-country euro zone bloc grew by 0.5 percent on the quarter in the first quarter, which translates to annualized growth of 1.8 percent in all of 2017, the European statistics agency Eurostat said.
The preliminary euro zone figure is much higher than the 0.7 percent annualized growth recorded in the United States in the same quarter, the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2014, according to U.S. estimates.
The weaker performance of the U.S. economy was a blow for the administration of Donald Trump, who has promised strong growth with a protectionist agenda.
The contrasting data from the U.S. and the euro zone may weaken the French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is calling for tariff barriers to protect the French economy. She faces free-trade supporter Emmanuel Macron in a May 7 runoff, which polls show Macron is likely to win.
In a further sign of a healthier recovery of the euro zone, Eurostat raised to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent its figures on growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-on-year estimate for the last quarter was also revised up, to 1.8 percent from the previous 1.7 percent.
Political risks, however, still represent a possible drag on euro zone growth. 
""The economy is proving to be resilient to uncertainty both abroad and at home. Bar a surprise at the French elections on Sunday, euro zone growth is set for a strong 2017,"" warned Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING.
Euroskeptic parties are also on the rise in Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, which may hold general elections in the coming months. No date is set, but they would come no later than next May.
Eurostat did not break down the components of the GDP growth, but economists expected it was led mostly by domestic consumption and business investment. 
Weaker domestic demand might reduce the pace of the expansion in the coming quarters as consumer prices rise.
""There remains the possibility that growth could be hampered by consumers being more reluctant to spend as their purchasing power is squeezed by overall higher inflation and limited wage growth in most countries,"" Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Markit said.
First estimates released in April show inflation in the 19-country currency bloc was 1.9 percent year-on-year in April, up from 1.5 percent in March and just short of the four-year high of 2.0 percent recorded in February.
But euro zone inflation figures continue to fluctuate. Data on industrial producer prices, also released by Eurostat on Wednesday, showed a marked slowdown in March.
Producer prices fell 0.3 percent in March and year-on-year growth slowed to 3.9 percent from February's 4.5 percent, which was the highest in more than five years.

""It seems that the slowdown in producer price inflation largely reflected energy effects, which should continue to bear down on producer and consumer price inflation over the rest of the year,"" said Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, noting that the ambivalent figures are likely to leave the European Central Bank's stimulus program unchanged this year.

Civil engineering grew at the fastest pace in just over a year and growth in house-building hit a four-month high.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit noted that this was the sharpest rise in total construction output so far in 2007 and attributed the improvement to civil engineering projects that registered their fastest rate of expansion in the past 13 months.
“April’s survey reveals a positive start to the second quarter of 2017, with a robust upturn in civil engineering activity helping to boost the construction industry,” Markit senior economist Tim Moore commented in the report.

Economists in a Reuters poll predicted a surplus of $7.03 billion, according to their median forecast, after a surplus of $4.862 billion in April 2016.
Brazil's hefty trade surplus has bolstered the country's currency despite a lingering political crisis and has fueled hopes of an imminent recovery after more than two years of deep recession. The real <BRL=> has gained 3 percent so far this year.
The government expects the trade surplus to set a new record this year, surpassing $55 billion, Trade Secretary Abrão Neto told journalists.
Exports totaled $17.686 billion and imports $10.717 billion. Exports rose 27.8 percent from a year earlier boosted by rising commodities prices, while imports grew 13.3 percent.
Average iron ore prices between January and April rose 127 percent from a year earlier, while oil gained 75 percent and poultry rose 19.3 percent, the trade ministry said.
Meat exports including beef, poultry and pork rose 0.2 percent from April 2016. Rising prices offset a 13-percent drop in volumes exported per day after a corruption scandal in the Brazilian meat industry led to temporary import bans last month.
Soybean exports rose 24 percent in April from a year ago, to $3.9 billion, amid a record harvest.

Brazil had a trade surplus of $21.387 billion between January and April, also a record for the period.

The Purchasing Managers' Index <BRPMIM=ECI> compiled by research firm Markit rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.1 in April from 49.6 in March. Readings above the 50 threshold indicate improving business conditions for manufacturers.
Output and new orders rose for a second straight month, encouraging companies to increase purchases of raw materials. The improvement was led by the domestic market as new export orders decreased, Markit said in a report.
Official data have also showed signs of a tentative recovery in industrial output, which returned to 2009 levels after a three-year-long downturn. The national statistics agency last month said the worst seemed to be over for the sector.
""Brazil's manufacturing industry kept itself in positive ground during April,"" Markit economist Pollyanna De Lima said.
""Even so, manufacturers seem a way off from operating at full capacity,"" she added, noting that manufacturers continued to cut jobs last month.

Economists forecast Brazil's industrial output to grow 1.4 percent and gross domestic product to expand 0.4 percent in 2017, according to a weekly central bank survey. Brazil's GDP fell more than 3 percent in each of the past two years.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturers began the second quarter at a blistering pace, increasing activity at the fastest rate for six years as demand remained strong despite rising prices, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone jumped to 56.7 in April from March's 56.2, reaching its highest level since April 2011. The figure was one tick down from a preliminary reading of 56.8.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday, also climbed further above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It registered a six-year high of 57.9, up from March's 57.5.
""Euro zone manufacturers reported buoyant business conditions in April, signaling an encouragingly solid start to the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The latest survey readings indicate that manufacturing is growing at an annual rate of approximately 4-5 percent, which should make a significant contribution to overall economic growth.""
Growth in the currency bloc will be steady but modest in the coming year, an April Reuters poll of economists showed, although that forecast was partly contingent on independent candidate Emmanuel Macron winning the French presidency next weekend.
Increasing demand came despite factories raising prices at the second-fastest rate in nearly six years. The output price index dipped last month to 55.4 from 55.6.
Signs that the years of ultra-loose monetary policy are paying off, with solid growth and inflationary pressures, will be welcomed by the European Central Bank.
Official data last week showed inflation rose more than expected in April, returning to the ECB's target, and a Reuters poll suggested the central bank's move would be to tighten policy.

The final reading was unchanged from a flash estimate published last month.
""Although growth of output, new orders and employment all eased, this was mostly offset by more evidence of supply chain pressures as input delivery times lengthened to the greatest extent in six years,"" IHS Markit economist Trevor Balchin said.
Input price inflation accelerated for a record ninth month running to reach the highest level in nearly six years, the survey showed. Panelists pointed to higher steel costs as a key source of inflationary pressure.
""Consequently, manufacturers increased their own prices at one of the fastest rates in six years,"" IHS Markit said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held rates steady for a ninth straight month on Tuesday in a widely expected decision as it balances the risk of rising household debt against subdued inflation and wages growth.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at a record low 1.5 percent, following easings in August and May last year. All 71 economists in a Reuters poll expected a steady outcome this week. [AU/INT]
The RBA sounded optimistic about the economy but retained its concerns about a ""mixed"" labor market. It added a new line in its statement, warning wages growth was expected to remain slow ""for a while yet"".
""That's the most pessimistic view on wages that we've seen from the RBA in a while,"" said Michael Blythe, an economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""It seems like they are confident that inflation is expected to remain low for sometime."" 
Australia's consumer price inflation tiptoed atop 2 percent last quarter for the first time since 2015 but the RBA's favored measures of underlying inflation stayed below its target band of 2-3 percent.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has on many occasions argued against the need for further stimulus, insisting any further cuts would be against the ""national interest"" as record-low cash rates have pushed households into a debt binge.
The Australian dollar  popped up briefly after the central bank statement, with investors focusing on some of the RBA's more upbeat assessments. It was last up 0.1 percent at $0.7534.
The RBA on Tuesday reiterated its expectation of economic growth of just above 3 percent over the next couple of years. Australia's A$1.7 trillion economy expanded at 2.4 percent through the year to December 2016 - ahead of most of its rich world peers.
HOUSING RISKS
Lowe is worried about ballooning housing debt at a time when wages are growing at a record low pace.
In Sydney and Melbourne - Australia's two most populous cities - home values are racing at a blistering 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
The surge in home prices in the major cities skidded to a halt in April, but the RBA made no reference to the slowdown in Tuesday's statement, repeating prices have been rising ""briskly"" in some markets. 
Australian regulators announced measures earlier this year to restrain lending to speculative property investors in a bid to cool the sizzling market and tighten lending standards. 
On the flip side, Lowe painted a rosy picture of the global economy, which has helped lift commodity prices and in turn boosted Australia's national income. 
He also said the forward-looking indicators on labor market pointed to growing employment. 
Data released last month showed Australia's jobless rate steadied at a 5.9 percent in March as employment surged the most in 1-1/2 years, far exceeding expectations.
However, a rate hike remains unlikely for now.
""It's too early for the RBA to think about raising rates given continuing low underlying inflation pressure, very high underemployment, record low wages growth and a still too high Australian dollar,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP.
""Signs that Sydney and Melbourne property markets may be starting to cool...add to the RBA's flexibility on rates.""

Futures market <0#YIB:> imply scant chance of a change to interest rates this year.

Britain's Brexit vote.
The Investec Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index rose to a three-month high of 55.0 from 53.6 in March, staying well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, which it almost fell into after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Ireland, the EU's fastest-growing economy, is widely seen as the member most at risk from Brexit due to its close trading links, but after the muted impact so far, Dublin last month raised its forecasts for economic growth for 2017 and 2018.
Some of the firms most vulnerable appear to be weathering the risks as the subindex measuring new export orders, which briefly contracted ahead of last June's referendum, rose to 58.5 from 56.2 in March, its highest level since July 2015.
""One of the key highlights is the new export orders index and firms continue to invest in providing additional resources to meet this rising client demand as evidenced by the expanding employment component,"" Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O'Sullivan said.
In contrast to the faster growth in hiring and purchases, sentiment among manufacturers softened to its lowest level since August. O'Sullivan said this was puzzling but that it could be due to seasonal issues as that sub-index is unadjusted.
""In any event, we reiterate our view that the outlook for Irish manufacturing firms remains positive, supported by the improving international backdrop,"" O'Sullivan said.

The Nikkei/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index <INPMI=ECI>, compiled by IHS Markit, held steady at March's 52.5 last month, its fourth month above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""Consumers were the key drivers of growth,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit. ""Buoyant domestic demand coupled with sustained growth of new orders from abroad boosted the upturn in total new business received by Indian manufacturers in April.""
A new orders sub-index rose to a six-month high of 53.8 last month from March's 53.6. Foreign demand also rose, although at a slower pace.
The increase in demand only provided a more modest lift to overall output and employment as higher prices of raw materials ate into firms' profits.
But despite rising cost burdens, factory gate prices barely rose as owners tried to sustain demand still recovering from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock move late last year to ban high-value currency notes that caused a huge disruption.
Decent economic growth and low inflation support the Reserve Bank of India's recent shift to neutral from an accommodative policy stance.
The central bank is expected to hold its policy rate steady at 6.25 percent at least until October next year, with the next move likely to be a cut, a Reuters poll conducted last month showed.

For the full-text statement, see:
Media ReleaseStatement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2017-09Date2 May 2017At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
There has been a broad-based pick-up in the global economy since last year. Labour markets have tightened further in many countries and forecasts for global growth have been revised up. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth is being supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, with the high level of debt continuing to present a medium-term risk. The improvement in the global economy has contributed to higher commodity prices, which are providing a significant boost to Australia’s national income. Australia’s terms of trade have increased, although some reversal of this is occurring.
Headline inflation rates have moved higher in most countries, partly reflecting the higher commodity prices. Core inflation remains low. Long-term bond yields are higher than last year, although in a historical context they remain low. Interest rates have increased in the United States and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively.
The Bank’s forecasts for the Australian economy are little changed. Growth is expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent. The economy is continuing its transition following the end of the mining investment boom, with the drag from the decline in mining investment coming to an end and exports of resources picking up. Growth in consumption is expected to remain moderate and broadly in line with incomes. Non-mining investment remains low as a share of GDP and a stronger pick-up would be welcome.
Indicators of the labour market remain mixed. The unemployment rate has moved a little higher over recent months, but employment growth has been a little stronger. The various forward-looking indicators still point to continued growth in employment over the period ahead. The unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually over time. Wage growth remains slow and this is likely to remain the case for a while yet.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. Lenders have announced increases in mortgage rates, particularly those paid by investors and on interest-only loans. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Inflation picked up to above 2 per cent in the March quarter in line with the Bank’s expectations. In underlying terms, inflation is running at around 1¾ per cent, a little higher than last year. A gradual further increase in underlying inflation is expected as the economy strengthens.
Conditions in the housing market continue to vary considerably around the country. Prices have been rising briskly in some markets and declining in others. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years.
Rent increases are the slowest for two decades. Growth in housing debt has outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. The recently announced supervisory measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2017 11:49PM ET</span>",China April factory growth slows to weakest in seven months: Caixin PMI,"By Yawen Chen and Nicholas Heath
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory sector lost momentum in April, with growth slowing to its weakest pace in seven months as domestic and export demand faltered and commodity prices fell, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
The findings echoed those in official manufacturing and service sector data on Sunday, reinforcing views that China's economic growth remains solid but is starting to moderate after a surprisingly strong start to the year.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.3 in April, missing economist forecasts' of 51.0 and a significant decline from March's 51.2.
The index remained above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, but only just, and grew at its slowest pace since September 2016.
The private factory survey suggested growth faded at a shaper pace than the official reading, but economists largely attributed the softening in both cases to a pullback in global commodity prices and signs of moderating in China's red-hot housing market after a flurry of government cooling measures. 
Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, said many companies had ""too strong"" a bullish view when global commodity prices began rallying late last year, but that trend is now changing, making firms more cautious about spending.
Coupled with more property tightening measures hitting the real estate sector -- a major driver for China's economy -- since March, market expectations may have started to reverse, she add.
The private survey showed production growth and total new orders rose at the slowest pace since last September, with both showing only slight improvement from the previous month.
Sharp falls in prices of iron ore, steel and other raw materials led to a sharp cooling in producer price inflation, which has helped some firms' such as steel mills and smelters post their strongest profits in years.
The official manufacturing PMI fell less sharply but still slid to a six-month low of 51.2 in April from March's near five-year high of 51.8, according to data at the weekend. Analysts had expected a reading of 51.6.
Growth in China's services sector slowed to 54.0 in April, from the previous month's 55.1, but remained robust. 
SLOW MODERATION EXPECTED, NOT SHARP COOLDOWN
China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in the first quarter, fueled by a construction boom. That is likely to give it enough of a tailwind to hit Beijing's full-year target of around 6.5 percent even if growth slowly fades in coming months as many analysts predict.
ANZ's Wang said the loss of momentum in the monthly activity surveys does not portend a growing risk of a hard landing at least in the short-term, noting the government in general still remain supportive of credit conditions for the real economy despite a crackdown in certain sectors such as real estate and interbank lending.
But analysts do expect growth to slow in the next quarters, estimating the softening seen in the surveys will eventually emerge in hard data such as investment.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, Singapore-based economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that the Caixin PMI fits with his view that underlying investment demand has weakened recently despite faster nominal growth in capital spending.
Those concerns, along with a tightening regulatory crackdown on riskier forms of lending and speculation, saw Chinese stocks post their worst month of the year in April.
Indeed, the degree of business confidence in April was the lowest so far this year, the survey noted, although companies generally expect output to increase over the next year.
Worries about operating costs and economic conditions weighed on confidence, though other survey respondents pointed to positives such as new product launches and a moderation in soaring input prices that have been squeezing profit margins for companies in the middle of supply chains.
Growth in total new orders slowed sharply to 50.9 from 52.7 in March, with the rate of expansion in new export orders also easing.
""The Chinese economy may be starting to embrace a downward trend in the near term as prices of industrial products decline and active restocking comes to an end,"" Zhong said. 
The pace of job shedding also intensified in April to a three-month high as a result of cost-reduction efforts and the non-replacement of voluntary leavers and retirees.

Compared with the official PMI, the Caixin/Markit survey tends to focus more on small- and mid-sized manufacturers. Both reports, however, suggested that smaller firms are under more pressure than their larger, state-backed peers.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell TO 52.2 from 52.9 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The index remained above the 50 threshold, which separates expansion from contraction, for the seventh consecutive month.
""A slightly softer trend in new business suggests that Q2 overall may not be quite as strong as the first quarter, but with jobs being created and confidence in the future sustained, the fundamentals for ongoing expansion remain in place,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the index.
The index for new business fell to 52.2 from 52.8 in March, while the business expectations index eased slightly to 55.0 from 55.4 in that month.
Services account for around two-thirds of Japan's gross domestic product, so expansion in the sector would support overall economic growth.
Japan's economy is seeing a modest recovery, although the improvement has been highly dependent on a rebound in exports.
Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at a stronger pace in April as export orders increased, a revised survey showed on Monday, suggesting firms' output remains on track to rise thanks to overseas demand.

The Final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 52.7, slightly below a preliminary 52.8 but still above the 52.4 notched in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001, but economists still expect an interest rate increase in June as the labor market tightens.
The weak reports on Monday came ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Economists said policymakers were likely to view the raft of soft data as temporary. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.
""We don't expect that will prevent the Fed from hiking interest rates again at the June meeting, at least not as long as employment growth rebounds in April and May,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to a four-month low of 54.8 in April from a reading of 57.2 in March. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM index had risen since last November, scaling a 2-1/2-year high in February, amid optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-business policy proposals.
It has declined in the last two months and some economists say the retreat probably reflects caution among business as they await implementation of the proposals. The Trump administration last week proposed a tax plan that includes cutting the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, but offered no details.
""The sugar high is wearing off,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Economics in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The manufacturing recovery is being supported by rising oil prices, which saw spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts surging at a record 449 percent rate in the first quarter.
Last month, nearly every sub-index of the ISM index fell. A measure of new orders received at factories tumbled to a five- month low. A gauge of factory employment dropped to its lowest level since October, which could pose a risk to an expected rebound in job growth in April.
U.S. stocks were little changed as gains in technology stocks, led by Apple (O:AAPL), countered the weak reports. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while the dollar held mostly steady against a basket of currencies.
INFLATION DIP SEEN TEMPORARY
The Fed lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March, in a nod to a strong labor market that is near full employment, and has forecast two more hikes this year.
The consumer spending data was included in last Friday's first-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 0.7 percent rate - the weakest performance in three years.
In March, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy slipped 0.1 percent, the first and largest drop since September 2001, after increasing 0.2 percent in February. The drop reflected declines in the prices of automobiles and mobile phone services.
In the 12 months through March, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since last July, after advancing 1.8 percent in February. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is below the central bank's 2 percent target.
""We view much of the weakness in March as driven by one-off factors and expect inflation to firm on a monthly basis in the very near term,"" said Rod Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""We continue to see services price pressures as firming further in the coming quarters.""
With price pressures subsiding, inflation-adjusted consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 percent in March, ending two straight months of decline. That bodes well for consumer spending in the second quarter.
Consumption will likely be supported by rising wages. Private sector wages recorded their biggest increase in 10 years in the first quarter.

In March, income gained 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in February. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain since December 2015. Savings increased to a one-year high of $849.1 billion from $819.0 billion in February.

The Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending slipped 0.2 percent. February's construction outlays were revised to show them surging 1.8 percent to a record $1.22 trillion instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent rise.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.4 percent in March. Construction spending advanced 3.6 percent from a year ago.
In March, private construction spending was unchanged after jumping 1.7 percent in February. Private construction outlays had increased for five consecutive months.
Investment in residential construction rose 1.2 percent.
Investment in homebuilding has now increased for six straight months. Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 1.3 percent in March after rising 0.8 percent in February.
Investment in residential and nonresidential structures such as oil and gas wells was one of the economy's few bright spots in the first quarter.
The government reported on Friday that gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, constrained by weak consumer spending
and a slowdown in the pace of inventory investment.
Investment in public construction projects fell 0.9 percent in March after surging 2.3 percent in February. Outlays on state and local government construction projects declined 1.4 percent in March after leaping 2.5 percent in February.

Federal government construction spending vaulted 4.5 percent after declining for two straight months.

(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms stalled in March, as business owners remained cautious about investing amid policy uncertainty, data released on Monday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index for March registered 134, down 1 percent from last March. The index was up 4 percent from February, which had four fewer working days.
Movements in the index typically correspond with changes in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead. The U.S. economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the first quarter, figures released on Friday showed, the slowest in three years.
Bets that U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tax cuts will boost corporate profits have lifted U.S. equities since his November election, but small businesses appear to be keeping their powder dry, said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder.
""They didn't get sucked into all the euphoria of public markets; they are just, 'Wake me up when we are there,'"" Phelan said in an interview. ""There's not going to be any kind of enthusiasm.""
Borrowing by healthcare companies was down 13 percent in the month, he said, probably reflecting worries about prospects for other Trump policies, including a so-far unsuccessful bid to repeal and replace the Obamacare healthcare law.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Meanwhile, a separate barometer of small companies' financial health suggests companies are not avoiding new debts because of troubles paying off old ones. The share of loans more than 30 days past due was 1.68 percent in March, unchanged from February, PayNet data showed.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2017 10:30PM ET</span>","South Korea April export growth hits near six-year high, trade surplus with U.S. falls","By Christine Kim and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports rose at a much faster-than-expected pace in April, surging for a sixth straight month helped by robust demand for high-tech memory chips and adding confirmation to perceptions of broad recovery in the global economy.
Exports to the United States rose in April but South Korea's trade surplus with that country declined on an annual basis over the same period, Monday's data showed, potentially easing concerns Washington may impose protectionist measures that could hurt South Korea's economy - Asia's fourth-largest.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week in an interview with Reuters that he was seeking to change a free trade deal with South Korea or scrap it entirely.
Preliminary data showed April's exports soared 24.2 percent from a year earlier to $51.01 billion, while imports surged 16.6 percent to $37.75 billion to create a $13.25 billion trade surplus, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.
Exports rose at the fastest pace since August 2011 when they gained 25.5 percent.
Shipments to the United States rose 3.9 percent on-year in April, rebounding from a 5.0 percent fall in March, the official breakdown showed. South Korea's trade surplus with the United States was $1.68 billion in April, down from $2.52 billion a year before.
Machinery, oil products and household electronics were the main drivers of exports to the United States last month.
""If this trend continues, South Korea will have likely escaped one of the criteria for currency manipulator designation,"" said An Ki-tae, an economist at NH Investment & Securities, adding the trade surplus with the United States was likely to fall below $20 billion this year if it kept declining at the current tempo.
""The controversy over trade with the United States will probably fade at this rate,"" he said.
A U.S. trade and customs enforcement law enacted last year set out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a ""material"" global current account surplus, a ""significant"" bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets.
South Korea is currently in the process of reducing its trade surplus with the United States, Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho said on Sunday.
Meanwhile, exports to China rose 10.2 percent on-year in April versus a 12.1 percent gain in March. Last month's gain was thanks to the booming construction sector and capital expenditure in China, the data showed.
The trade ministry said it was aiming to diversify South Korea's export destinations to reduce reliance on markets such as the United States and China, given persistent downside risks.
Overall, semiconductor chip and flat display panel exports boosted headline export performance in April, jumping 56.9 percent and 10.2 percent on-year respectively. Ship exports also lent a hand, soaring 102.9 percent.
With the general downturn in the shipbuilding industry, every ship delivery results in spikes in data, but even without the ship deliveries, exports would still have risen 16.8 percent on-year in April, the trade ministry said.
""It will be difficult for exports to maintain growth in the 20-percent range, we'll likely see growth slow a bit in the second half of the year as the base effects subside from crude oil products which drove export growth in the first quarter,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at HI Investment & Securities.
South Korean financial markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.
The average export value per working day was $2.27 billion in April, compared to $2.04 billion in March, according to Reuters calculations.
Exports have been gaining since November last year, bolstering economic growth in the first quarter. Central bank data last week showed first-quarter gross domestic product growth was a faster-than-expected 0.9 percent, the quickest in three quarters.

Last week, the trade ministry upgraded its export outlook for the year to between 6 and 7 percent growth from 2.9 percent seen previously.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>","Japan final April PMI shows manufacturing activity accelerating, export orders solid","TOKYO, (Reuters) - - Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at a stronger pace in April than the previous month as export orders increased, a revised survey showed on Monday, suggesting firms' output remains on track to rise thanks to overseas demand.
The Final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 52.7, slightly below a preliminary 52.8 but still above the 52.4 notched in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the eighth consecutive month.
The final index for new export orders was 53.3, less than the flash reading of 53.9 but still growing faster than 51.9 in the previous month due to demand from Southeast Asia, the survey showed.
Interestingly, while input prices rose sharply due to higher raw material costs, panelists also sought to protect margins by raising their charges.
That's a welcome indicator for the Bank of Japan's goal of raising inflation to its 2 percent target, a task that has proven elusive as highlighted by Friday's data showing March consumer prices remained benign.
The output prices index in April, at 51.2 from 50.1 in March, was up for the fourth consecutive month and was at the highest in almost 2-1/2-years.
The survey also showed firms' output was up from March, albeit sightly below the preliminary results with the latest production increase driven by capital goods producers.
Industrial output fell more than expected in March as electronics and auto makers curbed production, government data showed last week, prompting some economists to question the strength of the industrial sector.

All the same, the PMI report for April suggests this decline could be temporary as overseas orders and output remained on a strong footing.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2017 11:22PM ET</span>",China April manufacturing growth slows faster than expected,"By Sue-Lin Wong and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April, an official survey showed on Sunday, as producer price inflation cooled and policymakers' efforts to reduce financial risks in the economy weighed on demand.
The National Bureau of Statistics' official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a six-month low of 51.2 in April from March's near five-year high of 51.8.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.6, the ninth straight month above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Demand weakened across the board with the biggest decline in the input price sub-index, which fell to 51.8, its slowest expansion since June last year, from 59.3 in March.
Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, said recent sharp declines in iron ore and onshore steel prices point to some of the pressures the country's manufacturers are facing.
""We believe that this on one hand reflects that there is little improvement in underlying demand,"" Zhou wrote in a note.
""On the other hand, the de-leveraging effort by the Chinese authorities, has started to work.""
Chinese steel and iron ore futures tumbled to multi-month lows earlier this month as market sentiment turned bearish on demand outlook and worries mounted about a glut of steel later this year.
The employment sub-index slipped to 49.2 from 50.0 in March while the raw materials inventories sub-index was unchanged at 48.3.
Growth in China's services sector slowed slightly to 54.0 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014.
China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and the nation's gravity-defying property boom.
But growth is expected to slow as authorities step up a battle to cool the property sector and as the central bank and banking regulator take steps to contain financial risks.
The People's Bank of China is expected to guide short-term interest rates higher, and step up its oversight of the financial sector, amid a crackdown on banks' shadow banking businesses.
Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles, which analysts say pose a threat to the world's second-largest economy if not managed properly.
President Xi Jinping last week called for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Some analysts believe China's economic growth may have peaked in the first quarter but that it's on track to hit a target of around 6.5 percent this year.
China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter despite robust property investment.

The private sector Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, will be published on May 2. The Caixin/Markit PMI is expected to come in at 51.0 for April, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down from 51.2 in March.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2017 10:49AM ET</span>",U.S. first-quarter growth weakest in three years as consumer spending falters,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less on inventories, in a potential setback to President Donald Trump's promise to boost growth.
Gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate also as the government cut back on defense spending, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2014.
The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 1.2 percent pace last quarter. The survey was, however, conducted before Thursday's advance data on the March goods trade deficit and inventories, which saw many economists lowering their first-quarter growth estimates.
The pedestrian first-quarter growth pace is, however, not a true picture of the economy's health. The labor market is near full employment and consumer confidence is near multi-year highs, suggesting that the mostly weather-induced sharp slowdown in consumer spending is probably temporary.
A measure of private domestic demand increased at a 2.2 percent rate last quarter. First-quarter GDP tends to underperform because of difficulties with the calculation of data that the government has acknowledged and is working to rectify.
Even without the seasonal quirk and temporary restraints, economists say it would be difficult for Trump to fulfill his pledge to raise annual GDP growth to 4 percent, without increases in productivity.
Trump is targeting infrastructure spending, tax cuts and deregulation to achieve his goal of faster economic growth. On Wednesday, the Trump administration proposed a tax plan that includes cutting the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, but offered no details.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked to a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009 and followed the fourth quarter's robust 3.5 percent growth rate.
The weakness in consumer spending is blamed on a mild winter, which undermined demand for heating and utilities production. Higher inflation, which saw the personal consumption expenditures index averaging 2.4 percent in the first quarter - the highest since the second quarter of 2011 - also weighed on consumer spending.
Government delays issuing income tax refunds to combat fraud also curbed consumer spending. But with savings rising to $814.2 billion from $778.9 billion in the fourth quarter, consumer spending is likely to pick up.
GDP ""NOISY""
Economists believe Federal Reserve officials are likely to view both the anemic consumer spending and GDP growth as temporary when they meet next week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has previously described quarterly GDP as ""noisy.""
The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates next week. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year.
After contributing to GDP growth for two straight quarters, inventory investment was a drag in the first quarter.
Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $10.3 billion in the last quarter, down from $49.6 billion in the October-December period. Inventories subtracted 0.93 percentage point from GDP growth, almost reversing the 1.0 percentage point contribution in the fourth quarter.
Government spending fell at a 1.7 percent rate as defense outlays declined at a 4.0 percent pace, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2014. State and local government investment also fell.
There was some good news in the first quarter. Business investment improved further, with spending on equipment jumping at a 9.1 percent rate thanks to rising gas and oil well drilling as oil prices continue their recovery from multi-year lows.
Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts surged at a record 449 percent rate after rising at a 23.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter, accounting for the rise in nonresidential structures investment.
Spending on nonresidential structures accelerated at a 22.1 percent pace in the first quarter after falling at a 1.9 percent rate in the prior period.

Investment in home building rose at a 13.7 percent rate. Exports rose at a 5.8 percent rate, outpacing the 4.1 percent rate of increase in imports. That left a smaller trade deficit, which had a neutral impact on GDP growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2017 as households and high streets felt the pinch from higher inflation, which has risen sharply since last year's Brexit vote.
With the country heading for an election on June 8, there were other signs on Friday of a slowdown as house prices fell for a second month and a measure of consumer confidence dipped.
The Office for National Statistics said growth in the overall economy weakened to a one-year low of 0.3 percent in the three months to March from 0.7 percent in late 2016.
That represented a bigger slowdown in the rate of quarterly gross domestic product growth than the drop to 0.4 percent economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Last year, Britain vied with Germany to be one of the fastest growing of the world's major advanced economies with annual growth of 1.8 percent, defying widespread predictions of recession after the vote to leave the European Union.
But Friday's figures are the clearest sign so far that the country is slowing after the Brexit vote and in the run-up to the early election called by Prime Minister Theresa May, who says she wants to strengthen her hand in exit talks as Britain prepares to leave the EU in 2019.
That said, weak retail data last week had caused some to expect a weaker number and the currency markets brushed off the new numbers ahead of a holiday weekend.
British finance minister Philip Hammond said the economy remained resilient, but the opposition Labour Party said the figures showed living standards were under threat.
Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, expects growth to slow further in the coming months to a quarterly rate of 0.2 percent as the squeeze from inflation intensifies.
""This weakness is likely to be blamed on Brexit. That is probably fair,"" Clarke said.
Consumer price inflation stood at 0.5 percent at the time of the June 2016 Brexit vote, but since then it has risen to its highest in nearly four years at 2.3 percent, and many economists expect it to hit 3 percent later in 2017 or early next year.
Sterling fell by around 15 percent against major currencies after the Brexit vote and this -- combined with higher global prices for oil and other commodities -- is behind most of the rise in inflation, eating into households' disposable income.
The ONS said the biggest drag to first-quarter growth came from retailers and hotels, which had been hurt by higher prices. Last week it said retail sales suffered their biggest quarterly fall since 2010.
Despite the pick-up in inflation, the Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent as it waits to see the full impact of Brexit on the country's economy.
SLOWDOWN
British growth last year relied heavily on consumer spending -- to the extent that household saving fell to a record low -- while the boost some exporters have felt from a weaker currency has yet to revive the economy as a whole.
Businesses ranging from coffee shops to carpet fitters have reported tougher trading conditions, though some cheaper clothing chains are doing well.
The ONS said GDP growth in year-on-year terms rose to 2.1 percent from 1.9 percent in the final three months of 2016, the strongest rate since the second quarter of 2015.
The BoE and the International Monetary Fund forecast growth of 2.0 percent this year before a modest slowdown in 2018. Most private-sector economists see weaker growth this year.

Britain's dominant services sector grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, the weakest rate in two years, after growth of 0.8 percent in late 2016, the ONS said. Industrial output also rose 0.3 percent while construction expanded by 0.2 percent.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank cut its key interest rate on Friday for the second time this year and hinted at more cuts to come as inflation, already at a post-Soviet low, continues to fall.
The central bank reduced the key rate  to 9.25 percent from 9.75 percent, a deeper cut than analysts and economists polled by Reuters beforehand predicted.
""Given the decision taken and moderately tight monetary policy sustained, the Bank of Russia forecasts that annual consumer price growth will reduce to 4 pct before the end of 2017 and will remain within this target level in 2018-2019,"" the bank said in a statement on its web site.
The central bank said it was sticking to its previous plan of making gradual rats cuts in the second and third quarters of this year.
Elvira Nabiullina, the central bank's governor, said last week that the bank would consider cutting rates by 25 or 50 basis points.
The rouble weakened swiftly to 57.19 versus the dollar before returning to a level of 57.04. .
Despite a slowdown in inflation to 4.2-4.3 percent in late April from levels of nearly 17 percent seen just over two years ago, the bank reiterated concerns about inflation and volatility on global markets.
When making further rate decisions, it said it would take into account its baseline scenario, which assumes a drop in oil prices to $40 per barrel by the end of the year. 

The central bank is set to hold its next rate-setting meeting on June 16.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 1.9 percent year-on-year, Eurostat estimated, up from 1.5 percent in March and just short of the four-year high of 2.0 percent recorded in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast April annualized inflation at 1.8 percent, but estimates released on Thursday showing sharper-than-expected price hikes in Germany had prepared markets for a potential stronger figure for the bloc.
The ECB has a medium-term target for inflation at close to but just below 2 percent.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank monitors closely, also rose to 1.2 percent year-on-year in April from 0.8 percent in March, above market expectations of 1.0 percent.
The core level was at its highest level since September 2013.
The estimated figures for April could increase pressure on the ECB to wind down its monetary stimulus. The central bank has slashed interest rates into negative territory and adopted a bond-buying program worth 2.3 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion) to counter the threat of deflation and revive growth in the 19-member currency bloc.
The ECB on Thursday stuck to its ultra-easy policy stance, but explicitly acknowledged the vigor of the euro zone economy, now on its best run since the global financial crisis.
Overall inflation was higher primarily because of a 7.5 percent rise in energy prices and of 2.2 percent for unprocessed food.
Prices for food, alcohol and tobacco went up by 1.5 percent in April, actually lower than the 1.8 percent figure for March.
In the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, prices rose by 1.8 percent in April, compared with 1.0 percent in March.

Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in April, above expectations for an increase of 1.8% and following a final reading of a 2.0% advance in the prior month.
According to Eurostat, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in April (7.5%, compared with 7.4% in March), followed by services (1.8%, compared with 1.0% in March), food, alcohol & tobacco (1.5%, compared with 1.8% in March) and non-energy industrial goods (0.3%, stable compared with March).
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in April from the same period a year ago, after a 0.7% gain in the prior month. Analysts had expected core inflation to increase by 1.0%.
After the European Central Bank (ECB) kept monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, ECB president Mario Draghi predicted that inflation would rise in April and that it will then “hover around current levels until the end of this year.”
The ECB’s inflation target is officially close to, but below, 2.0%.
Draghi also indicated that “measures of underlying inflation remain low and are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term.”
The ECB will not hold its next monetary policy meeting until June 8.

The ONS noted that the slower growth in the first quarter was mainly due to services, which grew by 0.3% compared with growth of 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The ONS also warned that “there were falls in several important consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation; this was due in part to prices increasing more than spending.”

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 257,000 for the week ended April 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 112 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245,000 last week.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and only claims for Louisiana had been estimated.
Claims, however, tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of the different timings of spring and Easter holidays, which often throws off the model the government uses to smooth the data of seasonal fluctuations. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 500 to 242,250 last week, the lowest level since February. 
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 10,000 to 1.99 million in the week ended April 15. 
It was the second straight week that the so-called continuing claims remained below 2 million. The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell 16,000 to 2.0 million, the lowest level since June 2000.
The continuing claims data covered the survey week for April's unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims fell 23,500 between the March and April survey periods, suggesting a further improvement in the unemployment rate after it dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.5 percent last month.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. business spending likely gained momentum in first quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods rose less than expected in March, but a second straight monthly increase in shipments suggested business investment accelerated in the first quarter amid a recovering energy sector.
While other data on Thursday showed a bigger-than-expected increase in first-time applications for unemployment benefits last week, the trend in claims remained consistent with tightening labor market conditions. 
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.2 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in February. Orders for these so-called core capital goods have now increased for six consecutive months.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.4 percent after jumping 1.1 percent in February. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
""Business investment appears to have some better momentum early in 2017 and, while growth is far from hot, we appear to be transitioning away from the declines that plagued much of 2016,"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
Economists had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5 percent last month. The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks were little changed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading mostly higher. 
March's small increase in core capital goods orders suggests moderate business investment growth in the second quarter. It also implies a moderation in the manufacturing sector activity after recent strong growth. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, could get a lift from President Donald Trump's proposed tax plan, announced on Wednesday, that includes cutting the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.
For now, manufacturing is being underpinned by the energy sector revival. Energy services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) said last Friday that U.S. oil rigs totaled 688 in the week ending April 21, the most in two years. U.S. drillers have added oil rigs for 14 straight weeks and shale production in May was set for its biggest monthly increase in more than two years.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 0.7 percent after surging 2.3 percent in February. 
Business spending on equipment is expected to have accelerated from the fourth-quarter's annualized 1.9 percent growth pace and will likely be one of the few bright spots when the government publishes its advance first-quarter GDP estimate on Friday. 
WEAK FIRST-QUARTER GDP
Other data from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the goods trade deficit widening 1.4 percent in March. Though retail inventories increased 0.4 percent last month, stocks of goods at wholesalers dipped 0.1 percent. 
In the wake of the data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 0.2 percent rate, which would be the weakest performance in three years. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
With the labor market near full employment, the anticipated slowdown in growth likely understates the health of the economy. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 257,000 for the week ended April 22. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 112 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245,000 last week. 
""Despite this week's rise, we believe that the labor market remains solid and see no pattern in the underlying state data to give us pause on that assessment,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.  
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 500 to 242,250 last week, the lowest level since February. 

Other data from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to buy previously owned homes fell 0.8 percent in March, suggesting a persistent shortage of properties could hurt sales for the rest of the spring season. Home resales hit a 10-year high in March.

The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending April 22 increased by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 257,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 243,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 245,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 242,250, down 500 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended April 15 rose to 1.988 million from 1.978 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch down to 2.005 million.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 08:10AM ET</span>","ECB keeps interest rates, guidance unchanged as expected","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank left its interest rates and policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday, keeping its unprecedented stimulus in place as inflation is still below its target, even if growth is finally accelerating.
Fighting negligible inflation for years, the ECB has kept its deposit rate in negative territory since 2014 and plans to buy 60 billion euros worth of bonds each month at least until December.
Meeting between the two rounds of the French presidential election, the ECB was expected to take a cautious stance, staying largely on the sidelines even after pro-euro centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron appeared to be in pole position to win next weekend.
The majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB President Mario Draghi to maintain the bank's bias for policy easing at least until June, when a small shift in tone is possible.
On Thursday, the ECB repeated its standard guidance that it expects its key interest rate to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of its asset purchases.
It also affirmed that its asset buys, which have been cut by a quarter to 60 billion euros this month, could be increased or extended if the outlook for the euro zone becomes less favorable.
The ECB kept its rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, at -0.40 percent.
The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, was unchanged at 0.00 percent while the rate on the marginal lending facility - or emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks - remains at 0.25 percent.

Markets now turn their attention to Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT, where he will provide the rationale for the decision to keep the policy stance unchanged.

1122,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 07:46AM ET</span>",ECB keeps interest rates unchanged as expected; markets await Draghi,"Investing.com – As markets expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) made no changes to its record-low interest rates and announced no new measures on Thursday.
Specifically, he ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.0%, in line with forecasts.
The central bank also held its deposit facility rate steady at -0.4% and its marginal lending rate remained at 0.25% as expected.
Additionally, the ECB also confirmed, as previously announced, that the size of its monthly quantitative easing program would continue at the new monthly pace of €60 billion ($65.4 billion) until the end of December 2017, “or beyond, if necessary”.
“The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” the statement repeated.
After the decision, traders looked ahead to ECB president Mario Draghi’s press conference at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
Market participants will pay close attention to any hints Draghi may give on future path of monetary policy with particular regard to the removal of accommodation, although most analysts believe that he will only note slight improvements to the economy and leave major changes until the June meeting that will be accompanied by updated economic forecasts.
After the announcement and ahead of Draghi, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0883 from around 1.0900 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8442 from 0.8449 earlier.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 05:19AM ET</span>","BOJ most upbeat on economy in nine years, but warns stimulus exit distant","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan offered its most optimistic assessment of the economy in nine years at its policy meeting on Thursday and described recent weakness in inflation as temporary, signaling confidence a sustained recovery will help achieve its ambitious price target.
The BOJ kept its policy unchanged, as expected, but Governor Haruhiko Kuroda conceded that public perceptions of future price rises remained subdued, suggesting the central bank will significantly lag its U.S. and European peers in exiting its massive stimulus program.
The optimism about the economy and caution over the inflation outlook show the BOJ prefers to maintain the status quo on monetary policy for the time being, analysts say.
""The inflation and growth projections, as well as the upgrade of its economic assessment, were all in line with market forecasts, so there was no surprise at this meeting,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""As long as the economy maintains its momentum, the BOJ will likely stand pat at least until next spring, when Kuroda serves out his term.""
The BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent.
It also kept intact a loose pledge to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($719 billion), defying market speculation the guidance could be removed to pave the way for an eventual withdrawal of stimulus.
""Japan's economy has been turning toward a moderate expansion,"" the BOJ said a quarterly review of its long-term economic and price projections, compared with the previous month's view that it was ""improving moderately as a trend.""
It was the first time since March 2008 the BOJ used the word ""expansion"" to describe the state of the economy, signaling its conviction that the recovery was gaining momentum and that it saw no need for additional stimulus.
Despite the rosy economic view, Kuroda reminded markets the central bank is nowhere near an exit from its massive stimulus.
""We expect inflation to accelerate toward 2 percent but currently, inflation is around zero percent,"" Kuroda told reporters after the policy meeting.
""Talking about a specific exit strategy now would cause undue confusion in markets,"" he said. ""The prerequisite for such debate to happen is for inflation to achieve 2 percent.""
Kuroda added that the BOJ had no automatic trigger for starting debate on exiting its ultra-loose monetary policy.
DOUBTS ABOUT INFLATION
In the quarterly review, the BOJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the year ending in March 2018, blaming weak services prices and cellphone bill discounts by carriers facing fierce price competition.
But it maintained its projection that inflation will reach 2 percent during the fiscal year ending in March 2019 on the view that a tightening job market would gradually push up wages.
Many analysts doubt inflation will accelerate as quickly as the BOJ projects, with slow wage growth keeping households from boosting spending.
""The BOJ upgraded its economic assessment, but this is due more to overseas demand. Japan's labor market is tight, but retailers still want to cut prices,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Kuroda voiced confidence that continued improvements in the economy will eventually boost wages and inflation, but conceded that progress has been slow.
""Overall, inflation expectations haven't shown clear signs of a pick-up. They have bottomed out but haven't rebounded yet, so we need to look at developments carefully,"" he said.
Japan's economy has shown signs of life, as exports rose the most in over two years in March and manufacturers' confidence hit the highest since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
But core consumer prices for February rose just 0.2 percent from a year earlier, as weak private consumption has discouraged companies from raising prices.
While a pioneer in deploying unorthodox stimulus, the BOJ is likely to lag behind its peers in withdrawing monetary support.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is already embarking on interest rate hikes, while the European Central Bank may send a small signal in June towards reducing stimulus.
Most analysts polled by Reuters expect the BOJ's next move to be a tightening of monetary policy, though many do not expect it to happen until next year at the earliest.
After more than three years of huge asset purchases failed to accelerate inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework last September to one aimed at capping long-term interest rates.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 12:41AM ET</span>",China March industrial profits soar 23.8 percent on building boom but pace slowing,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by China's industrial firms rose 23.8 percent in March from a year earlier, buoyed by a continued construction boom, though the pace of growth eased from multi-year highs seen in previous months.
Profits in March rose to 688.7 billion yuan ($99.9 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Thursday.
In the first quarter, industrial profits climbed 28.3 percent to 1.7 trillion yuan, slowing from growth of 31.5 percent in the first two months but still robust enough to suggest a further recovery in fixed asset investment in China in coming months.
Higher government infrastructure spending and a frenzied housing market have helped spur sales and prices of building materials, reviving profits for the country's long-ailing ""smokestack"" industries such as steel mills and smelters and giving them stronger cash flow to reduce a mountain of debt.
But firms further down the supply chain are seeing pressure on profit margins as they struggle to pass on higher input costs to consumers amid stiff competition.
""Purchasing prices are rising too quickly which is increasing pressure on companies that are trying to cut raw material costs,"" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data, adding that financial costs for businesses are also rising.
Indeed, profits of equipment manufacturers rose 6 percentage points from the pace in Jan-Feb, while profits for makers of consumer products were up just 0.5 percentage points.
Profits for miners and producers of other raw materials fell 0.9 and 9.5 percentage points, respectively, likely reflecting a recent tumble in China's highly speculative commodities futures markets.
Shares of material companies have recoiled from their highest level since the 2015 market crash, while infrastructure stocks have pulled back from multi-month highs, though both are still up solidly so far this year.
All 13 steel companies that published first-quarter results as of April 19 reported net profits had more than doubled, the China Securities Journal said last week, with Nanjing Iron and Steel posting a surge of 4,830 percent.
Fatter profits for steel mills could make Beijing's job tougher as it tries to reduce industrial overcapacity by closing more inefficient and heavily polluting plants.
China's largest oil and gas producer, PetroChina, said earlier this month that it expected a first-quarter profit of 5-6 billion yuan, down slightly from the preceding quarter, but a turnaround from a huge loss a year earlier.
COOLING GROWTH
Many analysts, however, believe producer price inflation in China is peaking, which could temper profitability later this year and rob the world's second-largest economy of some momentum.
Still, strong first-quarter profits, together with an increase of 14.1 percent in fiscal revenue, have set ""an excellent foundation"" for improved growth quality in 2017, Ning Jizhe, vice chairman at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told the People's Daily in an interview on Wednesday.
China's government has lowered its economic growth target to around 6.5 percent this year from a range of 6.5-7 percent last year and an actual rate of 6.7 percent.
First-quarter growth came in at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent, which could give the economy enough of a tailwind to hit Beijing's full-year target even if growth starts to fade in coming quarters as many analysts expect.
Policymakers in China are pushing a bullish message on the world's second-biggest economy, pointing to a slowdown in capital outflows and a stable yuan after a selloff last year stoked fears of instability.
Ning told the state-run newspaper that market watchers should not be too sensitive to minor fluctuations in the economic growth rate and should pay more attention to the quality of growth instead.
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund raised its 2017 growth projection for the Chinese economy to 6.6 percent from 6.5 percent.
Industrial firms' liabilities rose 6.6 percent from a year earlier as of end-March, unchanged from the pace seen in the first two months of 2017.
The profit data covers large enterprises with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.
Data on Wednesday showed profits at China's state-owned firms rose 37.3 percent in the first three months of 2017 from a year earlier.

Companies signed up for $8.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit in March, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Their borrowing rose 51 percent from February.
""The central bank's recent rate hike may, in part, be responsible for the spike in equipment demand as businesses seek to lock in fixed rate financing ahead of steadily increasing interest costs,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 74.5 percent in March, down slightly from 74.8 percent in February.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or subsidiaries of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index fell to 65.8 in April from 71.1 in March.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2017 01:05PM ET</span>",Consumer confidence slips; new home sales hit eight-month high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell from a more than 16-year high in April, but a surge in new home sales to an eight-month high last month suggested underlying strength in the economy despite an apparent sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter. 
The economy's healthy fundamentals were also underscored by other data on Tuesday showing the biggest year-on-year increase in house prices in 2-1/2 years in February. Though consumer confidence slipped this month, it remained at a very high level and many households expected to buy big-ticket items like cars. 
That would suggest an acceleration in consumer spending after a slowdown that likely helped restrain economic growth at the start of the of the year.
""The housing market continues to look quite good. Consumers also have more jobs and are getting higher wages, so they will likely increase their spending this year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 120.3 this month from 124.9 in March, which was the highest reading since December 2000. The index in April was the second highest reading since 2000. 
Consumers' assessment of labor market conditions were slightly less favorable than in March. Still, the survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the second-highest since 2001.
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. The survey also showed increases in the number of consumers planning to buy major appliances. 
The dip in confidence is likely related to last month's failed attempt by Republicans in the House of Representatives to pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 healthcare restructuring popularly known as Obamacare.
That failure stirred concerns in financial markets about the difficulties the Trump administration might have in implementing other policies, including its plan to cut taxes.
""Consumer confidence is starting to reflect the realities of governing, not the hopes that the swamp will be drained,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors inHolland, Pennsylvania. ""The failure to implement any real policy changes has made people a little more uncertain about what will actually get done.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on other issues, including negotiations for a short-term spending deal to avert a shutdown of the U.S. government early on Saturday.
The dollar fell to a 5-1/2-month low against the euro. U.S. stocks were trading sharply higher, with the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) hitting the 6,000 mark for the first time. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG HOUSING MARKET
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 5.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,00 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. New home sales were up 15.6 percent compared to March 2016. They have now increased for three straight months. 
A tightening labor market, marked by a 4.5 percent unemployment rate, is boosting employment opportunities for young Americans and helping to support the housing market.
The strength of the housing market suggests that signs of a sharp moderation in economic growth in the first quarter are an aberration.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter after increasing at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its advance first-quarter GDP estimate on Friday.
While the inventory of new homes on the market in March increased to the highest level since July 2009, it is less than half of what it was at its peak during the housing boom in 2006. 
""The country needs a lot more new home construction to alleviate the supply shortage versus a rising pace of household formations in the past couple years and a recent shift back in favor of homeownership from renting,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

Tight housing stock is pushing up prices. A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of house prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.9 percent in February from a year ago, the largest gain since July 2014, after advancing 5.7 percent in January.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 120.3 this month from a reading of 124.9 (revised from an initial 125.6) in March.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 122.5 in April.
The Present Situation Index decreased from 143.9 to 140.6 and the Expectations Index declined from 112.3 last month to 106.7.
“Consumer confidence declined in April after increasing sharply over the past two months, but still remains at strong levels,” Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
Franco noted that consumers assessed current business conditions and, to a lesser extent, the labor market less favorably than in March.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.9 percent in February on a year-over-year basis, after an unrevised 5.7 percent increase in January. February's result topped the estimate of a 5.7 percent increase from a Reuters poll of economists and was the biggest year-on-year increase since July 2014.
David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the low stock of existing homes for sale - currently just 3.8 months of supply at current sales rates - is bolstering the price increases.
""Housing affordability has declined since 2012 as the pressure of higher prices has been a larger factor than stable to lower mortgage rates,"" he said. 
On a monthly basis, prices in the 20 cities rose 0.7 percent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed, just shy of expectations for a 0.8 percent increase.

On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, prices increased 0.4 percent from January.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in April likely fell almost 2 percent from a year earlier, with consumer discounts remaining at levels high enough to threaten the industry's long-term health, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Tuesday.
The consultancies also lowered their full-year 2017 forecast for new vehicle sales to 17.5 million units, from a previous forecast of 17.6 million.
April U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.48 million units, a drop of nearly 2 percent from 1.51 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 13 selling days of the month. Automakers are expected to report April U.S. sales results on May 2.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 17.5 million vehicles, flat versus the same month in 2016.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to decline more than 0.2 percent in April.
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as the market has begun to saturate, automakers have been hiking incentives to entice consumers to buy.
Fears that the U.S. auto industry has peaked were stoked earlier this month when automakers released sales figures for March that came in at an annualized rate of around 16.6 million, below market expectations of 17.2 million units.
""While industry retail sales pace remains high, it is being powered by elevated levels of incentive spending which pose a serious threat to the long-term health of the industry,"" said Deirdre Borrego, senior vice president of automotive data and analytics at J.D. Power.
Excessive discounts can help sell new vehicles, but undermine resale prices.
The consultancies said consumer discounts averaged $3,499 per new vehicle sold, the highest ever for the month of April. The previous record was set in April 2009, during the height of the Great Recession. 
But the average vehicle price also hit a new record for the month of $31,380.
Inventory levels at major automakers have also become a concern as sales have apparently hit a peak.

The average number of days a new vehicle sits on a dealer's lot before being sold hit 70 in the first 13 days of April, the highest level for any month since July 2009.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2017 02:50AM ET</span>",China's unemployment rate falls below 4 percent at end of first quarter,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's registered urban unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time in years, in a hopeful sign slower economic growth is not creating the massive unemployment Beijing fears will sow social instability.
The social security ministry said on Tuesday that 3.34 million new jobs were created in the first quarter.
The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.97 percent at the end of the first quarter, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security spokesman Lu Aihong told a news conference.
China has kept employment generally stable even as economic growth has slowed to a 26-year low and the government shuts down outdated industrial capacity, though many analysts say the official figure is an unreliable indicator of nationwide employment conditions.
On an annual basis, the official unemployment rate was last below 4 percent in 2001, when it was 3.6 percent, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The rate ended 2016 at 4.02 percent after not budging from 4.1 percent from 2010-2015.
China's leadership has touted strong jobs growth even as the economy enters a ""new normal"" of slower growth. Premier Li Keqiang said in March that China added 13.14 million new urban jobs in 2016 and aims to add another 11 million this year while keeping the registered unemployment rate below 4.5 percent.
That target seems safe, as China's official unemployment rate - which only accounts for urban, registered residents, and not including rural and migrant workers - last topped 4.5 percent 37 years ago in 1980 when it was 4.9 percent.
There are, however, signs of employment challenges in some sectors of the economy.
Lu said that China would need to resettle about half a million workers that lose jobs in the coal and steel sectors this year and will speed up development of a ""black list"" system for firms with wage arrears.
China's cabinet said last week that risks of mass unemployment in some regions and sectors have increased and pledged more fiscal and monetary policy support to address the potential rise in the jobless rate.
Workers in China's northern industrial centers have complained of being underemployed and underpaid, though not technically unemployed, as their previous well-paying jobs have gone away during economic restructuring.
A private manufacturing survey of Chinese companies by IHS Markit and Caixin have shown a mixed employment picture, with factories still shedding jobs, but at a slower pace, while services companies have been adding workers since mid-2016.
A survey-based unemployment rate published by the statistics bureau had fallen slightly over the past year to under 5 percent at the end of March.

Inflation for the year through mid-April was 5.62 percent <MXCPHI=ECI>, the national statistics institute said on Monday.
The figure was the highest since June 2009, and above expectations of economists polled by Reuters for 5.58 percent.
Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens last week signaled on that the bank's cycle of monetary tightening might not be over.
The Banco de Mexico has raised the benchmark interest rate to 6.50 percent, its highest since 2009, with a string of 50-basis point hikes followed by a smaller increase, 25 points, in its last board meeting in late March.
The core price index <MXCPIC=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.76 percent in the 12-month period to mid-April, above the 4.61 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. The rate is at its highest since August 2009.
A deep slump in the peso last year has pressured inflation, but a recent rally in the currency could help contain pressures.
In the first half of April, consumer prices fell 0.15 percent <MXCPIF=ECI> as summer electricity subsidies kicked in, while the core price index <MXCPIH=ECI> climbed 0.26 percent.
A separate report from the statistics institute showed the pace of economic growth in February slipped to its slowest since last August.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale brightened more than expected in April, hitting its highest in nearly six years, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting Europe's largest economy is set to carry its robust upswing into the second quarter of this year.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 112.9 from an upwardly revised 112.4 in March.
The reading, the highest since July 2011, came in stronger than a Reuters consensus forecast for a value of 112.5.
""The German economy is growing strongly,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters that the German economy was not being influenced by political uncertainties such as the threat of rising protectionism, major elections in Europe and the course of Brexit negotiations.
The survey was conducted in the first half of April, meaning it did not include any reaction to the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday in which centrist Emmanuel Macron came in first, qualifying for a May 7 runoff alongside far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
Managers' assessments of the current business situation improved significantly while their outlook for the coming six months was a bit less optimistic, it showed.
Morale improved in construction, retailing and wholesaling whereas managers in manufacturing were somewhat less upbeat.
In construction, assessments of the current business situation rose to a new record high while expectations remained broadly positive and the order level was excellent, Ifo said.
GOLDEN CYCLE
""The Ifo index continued its recent surge in April, increasing for the third consecutive month, suggesting that Germany's golden cycle has entered yet another round,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""The only weak spot of the German economy remains rather sluggish investment,"" he noted, adding the government should focus on the import side of the trade surplus and further support domestic demand, preferably in the form of stimulating higher private and further increasing public investments.
Germany's gross domestic product grew by 1.9 percent last year, the strongest rate in five years, helped by a vibrant domestic economy which more than offset a drag from net trade.
Strong industrial output and export figures for January and February have suggested that the economy shifted into an even higher gear in the first quarter of 2017, helped by rising global demand for cars and machines.
Economists expect Germany's quarterly growth rate to clearly pick up in the January-March period after 0.4 percent in the final three months of 2016.
Germany's VDMA engineering association said earlier on Monday it could lift its growth forecast for this year if early signals of positive business sentiment persist and prove justified.
VDMA head Carl-Martin Welcker said higher demand from emerging markets such as Russia and India could lift German engineering production this year after a year of stagnation while China, the United States and Britain were sources of uncertainty.

The association, which represents thousands of companies with over a million workers and more than $200 billion in annual revenue between them, has forecast 1 percent growth this year in output and exports.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday that existing home sales increased 4.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.71 million units last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing 2.5 percent to a pace of 5.60 million units in March.
February's sales pace was revised slightly down to 5.47 million units. Sales were up 5.9 percent from March 2016, hitting their highest level since February 2007.
The housing recovery has been underpinned by falling unemployment and rising wages. The unemployment rate declined to 4.5 percent in March to near a 10-year low.
But demand is outstripping supply. While the number of homes on the market rose 5.8 percent to 1.83 million units last month, housing inventory was down 6.6 percent from a year ago.
Properties typically remained on the market for 34 days in March compared to 45 days in February, the NAR said.
At March's sales pace, it would take 3.8 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, unchanged from February. 
""We had a housing shortage last year and in the early parts of 2017 the housing shortage has intensified,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
Housing inventory has dropped for 22 straight months on a year-on-year basis.

With supply still tight, the median house price rose 6.8 percent from one year ago to $236,400 in March, the 61st consecutive month of year-on-year price increases.

The industry data showed that home resales increased by 4.4% in March to a seasonally adjusted 5.71 million units from 5.47 million units in the previous month. February’s data was revised slightly lower from an initial reading of 5.48 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 2.5% rise from February’s initial reading to 5.60 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
The report also showed that the median existing-home price in March was $236,400, up 6.8% from March 2016 ($221,400).
The report indicated that the existing-home sales took off in March to “their highest pace in over 10 years, and severe supply shortages resulted in the typical home coming off the market significantly faster than in February and a year ago.”
“The early returns so far this spring buying season look very promising as a rising number of households dipped their toes into the market and were successfully able to close on a home last month,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
""Although finding available properties to buy continues to be a strenuous task for many buyers, there was enough of a monthly increase in listings in March for sales to muster a strong gain,” he remarked, adding that “sales will go up as long as inventory does.""

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 52.5 in April, from the prior month’s reading of 52.8.
Analysts had expected the reading to recover to 53.0.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.8 in April from the prior month’s final reading of 53.3.
Analysts had expected an increase to 53.5.
The composite PMI, including activity in both sectors, slipped to 52.7 in April from the previous month’s reading of 53.0. That was its weakest reading since September 2016.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The PMI data suggest the US economy lost further momentum at the start of the second quarter,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
“The surveys are signaling a GDP growth rate of 1.1% after 1.7% in the first quarter,” he added.
Williamson pointed out that the manufacturing sector showed signs of growth slowing further from the two-year high reached at the beginning of the year, despite export orders lifting higher.
He also noted that the labor market continued to soften with a step-down in the pace of hiring consistent with the creation of around only 100,000 non-farm payrolls.
“The survey responses indicate that some froth has come off the economy since the post-election bounce seen at the end of last year,” Williamson explained.
“However, with inflows of new business picking up slightly in April and business optimism about the year ahead also brightening, there’s good reason to believe that growth could revive again in coming months,” he concluded.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economy bounded into the second quarter with strong broad-based growth, according to a survey showing businesses increased activity at the fastest rate for six years as new orders stayed robust.
Signs the bloc is on a sustainable growth path, along with inflationary pressures, will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has struggled for years to achieve either, despite ultra-loose monetary policy. Consumer confidence is also improving. 
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to growth, climbed to 56.7 from March's 56.4, its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
That matched the most optimistic forecaster in a Reuters poll in which the median prediction was a dip to 56.3.
""April's rise in the euro zone composite PMI adds to evidence that the economy is performing well,"" said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics.
IHS Markit said the latest PMI data, if maintained, pointed to second-quarter economic growth of 0.7 percent, well above the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll on Thursday. [ECILT/EU]
""There is a good outlook for the year - it looks like the upturn has legs. With numbers like these, people are going to start edging up their forecasts,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Earlier data from Germany showed its private sector grew at a slower pace this month as services shifted into a lower gear but factory activity remained high, suggesting Europe's biggest economy is carrying its upswing into the second quarter.
French business activity confounded expectations in April by growing at the fastest pace in nearly six years, showing no signs of cooling down just days before the most uncertain presidential election in years. 
Although no major survey sees her winning, far right and anti-European Union leader Marine Le Pen is polling strongly. None of the economists polled by Reuters this week said she would be best for French economic growth. http://reut.rs/2pBAZQr
""Even though on the eve of the first round of the French elections a good portion of caution is recommendable, evidence is piling up that the euro zone economy could become the positive growth surprise of the year,"" said ING chief economist Carsten Brzeski.
HIGH HIRING
Providing further evidence the recovery will continue, a sub-index measuring new business in the euro zone only dipped to 55.8 from March's six-year high of 56.2.
Firms in the bloc's dominant service industry increased activity faster this month, with its PMI rising to 56.2 from 56.0, a six-year high. That was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, where the median predicted no change.
To meet the growing demand, and indicating confidence about the months ahead, hiring remained vigorous. The employment index held steady at 54.4, its highest since November 2007.
Factories also had a good start to the quarter - the manufacturing PMI climbed to a six-year high of 56.8 from 56.2, surpassing all estimates in a Reuters poll. An index measuring output jumped to 58.0 from 57.5, the highest since April 2011.

Future output, which gauges what factories think they will produce, rose to 66.9 from 66.6. That matched the highest reading of the sub-index, started in July 2012, set in January.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.8 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, from a final 52.4 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the eighth consecutive month.
The flash index for new export orders rose to 53.9 from a final 51.9 in the previous month. The output component of the PMI index was a preliminary 53.6, up from 53.0 in March.
""April's PMI data signaled continued healthy growth of
Japans manufacturing sector, and the latest results were
again consistent with production rising at a quarterly rate
of around 2 percent,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS
Markit, which compiles the survey.
Companies also hired more workers, but price pressures continue to mount with input costs and output charges rising at stronger rates, Smith noted.
Japan's exports in March rose at the fastest pace in more than two years, government data showed on Thursday, underlining strength in external demand that is helping to offset stubbornly sluggish domestic demand.

Economists expect Japan's exports will continue to rise as global growth gains momentum, but concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges to adopt more protectionist trade policies are clouding the outlook.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2017 03:03PM ET</span>","Venezuela says inflation 274 percent last year, economists say far higher","By Girish Gupta and Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - Annual inflation in crisis-hit Venezuela last year reached 274 percent, according to data the central bank provided to the International Monetary Fund, although many economists believe the true figure is far more alarming. 
In the midst of a bruising economic crisis, the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro has not published inflation data for more than a year. 
Venezuelan consultancy Ecoanalitica says inflation was 525 percent last year and New York-based investment bank Torino Capital - using one popular food item as a proxy - put it at 453 percent. 
Maduro himself last year increased the minimum wage by 454 percent, saying the rise was to offset inflation.
The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for information. 
A wave of anti-government unrest is underway across the country. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets on Wednesday, only to be dispersed with tear gas and water cannons.
One factor for high inflation is Venezuela's soaring money supply, up more than 200 percent in the last year, its fastest rise since records began in 1940.
Purchasing power has eroded and salaries annihilated as a result. On the black market, $1,000 in savings when Maduro was elected in 2013 would now be worth less than $5. 
The bolivar currency fell further against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and is now at its lowest value ever against the dollar, down 99.5 percent since Maduro came to power.
Inflation is one facet of the OPEC member's crippling economic crisis, as it contributes to putting basic food products out of reach for millions. Maduro blames the problems on an ""economic war"" being waged against it by the U.S. government and opposition ""terrorists."" 
Many economists blame strict currency and price controls.

The IMF figure places Venezuela as the country with the second highest inflation in the world, after South Sudan which last year clocked inflation of 480 percent. The IMF did not receive Gross Domestic Product data from Venezuela's central bank.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2017 11:19AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; mid-Atlantic factory activity cools,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, but a drop in the number of Americans on unemployment rolls to a 17-year low suggested the labor market continues to tighten.
The labor market's strength was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region hired more workers this month and increased working hours, even as factory activity slowed from March's brisk pace.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended April 15, the Labor Department said. The increase followed three straight weeks of declines. 
Given that the labor market is near full employment with a 4.5 percent jobless rate and companies are reporting difficulties finding skilled workers, some economists see limited scope for claims to fall further.
""Layoffs remain low and employers feel no need to aggressively trim their payrolls. As labor market conditions tighten, the pool of available unemployed skilled workers continues to dry up,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 111 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 242,000 last week.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,250 to 243,000 last week. 
SHRINKING UNEMPLOYED POOL
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 49,000 to 1.98 million in the week ended April 8, the lowest reading since April 2000. 
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its index of current manufacturing activity fell to a still-high reading of 22.0 this month from 32.8 in March. The index has been positive for nine consecutive months. April's slowdown was driven by a pullback in the new orders and shipments measures.
Firms reported an increase in manufacturing employment and workweek this month. The current employment index rose 2.4 points to its highest level since May 2011. 
There was also a jump in manufacturers reporting intentions to boost capital spending this year. The capital expenditures expectations index rose to its highest level in just over 17 years.
""The continued increase bodes well for continued strength in capex spending in coming months,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks rose amid increased optimism around the first-quarter earnings season. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. 
The claims data covered the survey week for April nonfarm payrolls. Claims declined 17,000 between the March and April survey periods, suggesting that job growth likely picked up this month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since May 2016.
An acceleration in employment growth would confirm that March's moderation was weather-driven and underscore the economy's strong fundamentals despite signs that growth slowed to well below a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.

""The claims data support our view that temporary factors, mainly the weather restrained job growth in March and that we should see stronger results in the April data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers has risen for an eighth straight month to a level not seen since before the 2008 global financial crisis, a Reuters survey found, reflecting output and export gains led by overseas economic recovery.
The Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan - also showed confidence at service-sector firms hit a three-month high, a sign that the effects of an export-led economic recovery are spreading - albeit gradually.
The Reuters Tankan highlights the signs of life Japan's economy has shown in recent months as global demand has recovered, despite the weakness in private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy.
In the poll of 529 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between April 4-17 in which 261 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose one point to 26 in April, led by manufacturers of items such as food, metals and machinery.
It was the highest reading since August 2007, a year before the collapse of a U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis.
At plus 28, the service-sector gauge was up two points in April from March, led by wholesalers.
""Currencies are stable, which provides favorable conditions for exporters. The machine tools market also remains in an uptrend,"" a manager at a nonferrous metals producer wrote in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
But manufacturers and non-manufacturers expected conditions to worsen in the coming three months, highlighting their concerns about a strong yen, analysts say. Geopolitical risks such as North Korea's missile threats, and uncertainty over the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump weigh on the outlook.
""Rising sentiment despite the dollar's fall below 110 yen during the survey period underscores that underlying conditions are firm,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
""But deterioration in the outlook sentiment suggest that manufacturers are becoming cautious about a strong yen.""
The sentiment index was seen lower at 20 for manufacturers and 26 for non-manufacturers in July.
""Uncertainty is mounting overseas, with emerging markets and resource-producing economies undershooting, while protectionism is on the rise - as seen in Britain's vote to exit the European Union and the results of the U.S. presidential election,"" a manager at a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
The BOJ's last tankan out on April 3 showed big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high, and service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters.

The central bank survey also showed companies remained upbeat on their capital expenditure plans, offering hope the economic recovery will gather momentum in coming months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose in March at the fastest pace in more than two years as increased shipments of car parts and steel signaled that expanding overseas demand could help boost the country's notoriously slow economic growth.
Exports rose 12.0 percent in March from a year ago, more than the median estimate of 6.7 percent annual growth. The data also showed Japan's trade surplus with the United States narrowed, although this development is unlikely to wholly ease concerns about U.S. trade policy.
Japan's exports are expected to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum, but concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges to adopt more protectionist trade policies cloud the outlook for Japan's trade.
Exports to the United States rose 3.5 percent in March from a year ago due to higher shipments of car parts. That compares with a 0.4 percent annual increase in U.S.-bound exports in the previous month.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 8.1 percent in March from a year ago to 628.1 billion yen ($5.77 billion) on rising imports of liquefied natural gas and grains.
Exports to China rose 16.4 percent in March from a year ago, following a 28.2 percent annual surge in exports in February following the Lunar New Year.
Japan's exports to Asia rose 16.3 percent year-on-year in March after rising an annual 21.0 percent in the previous month.
The overall trade balance came to a surplus of 614.7 billion yen versus the median estimate for a 575.8 billion yen surplus.
On Tuesday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence put Japan on notice that Washington wants results ""in the near future"" from talks it hopes will open Japan's markets to U.S. goods.
Pence was speaking in Tokyo where he attended the first U.S.-Japan economic dialogue with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
The next meeting will be held in Washington before year's end, where the Trump administration could press for concessions on trade that could increase U.S. exports to Japan.

Eurostat confirmed inflation in March in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed down to 1.5 percent year-on-year from a four-year high of 2.0 percent recorded in February.
But core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank monitors closely, was revised up to 0.8 percent year-on-year in March from an earlier estimate of 0.7 percent.
The core figure remained, however, lower than the 0.9 percent recorded in February.
On a monthly basis, headline inflation was 0.8 percent in March, in line with market expectations, while core inflation was 1.2 percent higher, below the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 1.3 percent.
The revised core data may slightly strengthen the hand of those who support winding down the ECB monetary stimulus, although inflation remains below the central bank's target of inflation close but below 2 percent over the medium term.
The ECB has slashed interest rates into negative territory and adopted a bond-buying program worth 2.3 trillion euros ($2.46 trillion) to counter the threat of deflation and revive growth in the 19-member currency bloc.
Overall inflation was lower primarily because energy prices rose by only 7.4 percent year-on-year from 9.3 percent in February. In its earlier estimates, Eurostat said energy prices went up 7.3 percent in March.
The statistics office confirmed prices for food, alcohol and tobacco went up by 1.8 percent in March, from a 2.5 percent increase recorded the previous month.

The IPA Bellwether report forecast corporate ad spending would rise 0.6 percent in the current financial year, revising a previous forecast, made in October and reiterated in January, for a 0.7 percent decline.
The survey, conducted by IHS Markit on behalf of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said on balance a net 26.1 percent of UK companies indicated they would increase their advertising budgets in the 2017/18 financial year.
Growth in ad spending would stagnate in 2018 before trending upwards again in 2019 and 2020, the report said.
""The ... survey paints a picture of a solidly growing UK economy, with companies continuing to show a willingness to commit increased resources to marketing and capitalize on current positive sales trends,"" said IHS Markit's senior economist Paul Smith.
The report showed a net balance of 11.8 percent of companies increased their budgets in the first quarter, led by a jump in internet ad spending, which touched its highest level in just under four years.
The increase comes even as Google's YouTube (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), which dominate global online ad spending, face rising criticism for not sufficiently policing offensive posts and content. That has prompted some top client brands to pull ads in recent months.
""Despite the current, turbulent digital ecosphere, it is clear that marketers are attracted to the cost-effectiveness of digital advertising and its ability to reach and accurately target their consumers,"" said IPA's director general Paul Bainsfair.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell in March after unseasonably mild weather buoyed activity in February and manufacturing output dropped for the first time in seven months, further indications that economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter.
Coming on the heels of data last week showing the second monthly decline in retail sales in March as well a decrease in consumer prices, Tuesday's dour reports could reduce prospects of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in June.
""The economy seems to have hit a soft patch in the first quarter and Fed officials are likely to wait to see the rebound before raising rates again. The clouds from the outlook skies may not lift until late this summer,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Housing starts decreased 6.8 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units as the construction of single-family homes in the Midwest recorded its biggest decline in three years, the Commerce Department said. 
Economists had forecast homebuilding falling to a 1.25 million-unit pace last month. Housing starts were up 9.2 percent compared to March 2016.
In a separate report, the Fed said manufacturing production dropped 0.4 percent in March, weighed down by a 3.0 percent decline in the output of motor vehicles and parts.
That was the first and biggest decline in factory production since last August. The return of cold temperatures, however, resulted in a record 8.6 percent surge in utilities output, helping to lift industrial production 0.5 percent last month.
Manufacturing output rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter as the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, continues to recover after a prolonged drag from lower oil prices, a strong dollar and an inventory overhang.
WEAK FIRST-QUARTER GROWTH
Reports on consumer and construction spending as well as inventory investment suggest the economy slowed sharply in the first quarter after gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting GDP rising at a 0.5 percent rate in the first three months of the year, which would be the weakest performance in three years. The Fed lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. 
Tuesday's weak reports combined with other factors to push the dollar to a nearly three-week low against a basket of currencies and lift prices for U.S. government bonds. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower, also hurt by disappointing quarterly results from corporate heavyweights Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ).
Last month's decline in homebuilding was likely payback after the warm weather pulled forward construction in February.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, fell 6.2 percent to an 821,000 unit pace last month, retreating from a near 9-1/2-year high. Single-family starts in the Midwest, which was lashed by a storm last month, declined 35 percent. 
That was the largest drop since January 2014 and pushed starts to their lowest level since August 2015. Single-family building permits in the Midwest decreased 5.9 percent. 
Single-family starts also fell 5.5 percent in the West and were unchanged in the Northeast. They rose 3.2 percent in the South. Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 7.9 percent to a 394,000 unit pace. 
Still, housing remains on solid footing. Overall building permits increased 3.6 percent, driven by a 13.8 percent jump in the multi-family segment. 
Though single-family permits fell 1.1 percent last month, they were not too far from the more than nine-year high reached in February. A tightening labor market, which is generating steady wage growth, is underpinning the housing market.
""Mild winter weather in the first two months of the year pushed construction forward,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Homebuilding continues its gradual recovery."" 

The sector, however, remains constrained by a dearth of properties available for sale. Builders have failed to bridge the gap, citing a range of problems including shortages of labor and land as well as rising material prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in March as the construction of single-family homes in the Midwest recorded its biggest decline in three years, but an increase in building permits suggested the housing market recovery remained intact.
Housing starts decreased 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
February's starts were revised up to a 1.30 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.29 million-rate. 
Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity falling to a 1.25 million-unit pace last month. Homebuilding was up 9.2 percent compared to March 2016.
The dollar held at lower levels against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. government bonds were little changed. U.S. stock futures were lower. 
Unseasonably warm temperatures buoyed homebuilding in February, but temperatures dropped in March, with a storm lashing the Northeast and Midwest regions. Bad weather could have accounted for some of the drop in homebuilding last month.
Single-family homebuilding, which makes up the largest share of the residential housing market, fell 6.2 percent to an 821,000 unit pace last month, retreating from a near 9-1/2-year high.
Single-family starts in the Midwest declined 35 percent, the largest drop since January 2014, to their lowest level since August 2015. Single-family starts in the Northeast were unchanged. They rose 3.2 percent in the South, but fell 5.5 percent in the West. 
Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 7.9 percent to a 394,000 unit pace. 
Pointing to underlying strength in the housing market, building permits increased 3.6 percent, driven by a 13.8 percent surge in the multi-family segment. 
While single-family permits fell 1.1 percent last month, they were not too far from the more than nine-year high reached in February. A tightening labor market, which is generating steady wage growth is underpinning the housing market. 
The sector, however, remains constrained by a dearth of properties available for sale. Builders have failed to bridge the gap, citing a range of problems including shortages of labor and land as well as rising material prices. 

A survey on Monday showed homebuilders confidence slipped in April from a near 12-year high in March. Still, measures of current sales and sales expectations remained at lofty levels.

Data on Tuesday from the National Bureau of Statistics showed the industrial sector grew 6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.
For a table of GDP growth breakdown by sector, see:
On Monday, China reported first quarter growth of 6.9 percent, the quickest in six quarters.
Within the industrial sector, manufacturing grew 7.0 percent compared with the first quarter last year.
Analysts credited growth in exports, in contrast to a contraction in the first three months of 2016, for providing the pick-up in the first quarter.
""It looks to us like the acceleration in 1Q 2017 GDP growth came from electronics exports complementing the 4Q 2016 growth drivers, housing and infrastructure investment,"" Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, said in a note.
ANOTHER BRIGHT SPOT
The other bright spot was the retail and wholesale sector, which also expanded at the fastest pace since the end of 2014. In January-March, the annual growth pace was 7.4 percent, compared with 5.8 percent a year earlier, data showed.
However, growth in the construction industry slowed to 5.3 percent from 5.9 percent at the end of last year and has decelerated for four straight quarters, despite rising investment in infrastructure and the real estate industry.
The property sector grew 7.8 percent in the first quarter, up from 7.7 percent at the end of 2016, while growth in the finance industry rose to 4.4 percent from 3.8 percent.
NBS data showed housing starts picked up in March, growing nearly as fast as sales, which could be a warning sign for overheating in the sector, said Rosealea Yao at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.

""Construction growth is in double digits again, which is not consistent with underlying trends as housing demand has peaked,"" said Yao.

Members commenced their discussion of international developments by noting that conditions in the global economy had continued to improve over 2017. Survey measures of business conditions in both the manufacturing and services sectors were at high levels and growth in industrial production had increased further.
There had been a significant increase in the growth of global merchandise trade volumes. Data on merchandise imports suggested that stronger demand from east Asia (excluding Japan) and the United States had been an important source of this growth. At the same time, merchandise imports to some other emerging markets had stopped falling. Members noted that many economies had benefited from this increase in demand for traded goods; merchandise exports from Australia, much of Asia (excluding China) and other emerging economies had grown particularly strongly.
GDP growth was expected to be above potential over 2017 in all three major advanced economies, supported by accommodative monetary policies. As a result, spare capacity in the labour markets of these economies was likely to continue to decline.
Global inflation had increased, driven by the rise in oil prices over 2016. However, oil prices had been relatively stable since late 2016 and core inflation rates had remained low in most economies. This suggested that headline inflation could decline unless the reduction in spare capacity in the major advanced economies generated greater inflationary pressures.
The Chinese economy appeared to have strengthened over recent months, supported by accommodative financial conditions and increased public spending. Conditions in the residential property market had remained buoyant, although housing price growth had slowed sharply in those cities where policies to constrain speculative housing activity and price growth had been implemented. Growth in dwelling investment had increased over 2016 and growth in investment in the manufacturing sector had been stable since mid 2016. Members noted that growth in infrastructure investment had remained strong and had been significantly affected by policy settings in the past.
In the United States, household consumption was expected to be the key driver of expenditure growth, partly because of low borrowing costs and further improvements in labour market conditions and despite some indications that consumption growth had been weak at the start of 2017. In addition, investment intentions of the business sector had risen sharply. The risk of more protectionist policies remained, which could harm growth, but it was unclear what form these policies might take.
The prices of iron ore, oil and coking coal had declined since the previous meeting, but remained well above the lows of 2016. Other commodity prices had been little changed over the prior month. Members noted that the damage caused by Cyclone Debbie was likely to disrupt coking coal production in the Bowen Basin for a short time. Given that this is one of the largest coking coal-producing regions in the world (and accounts for around one-third of Australia's coal exports), short-term price increases were likely.
Members noted that iron ore production costs had declined significantly over the past five years and that Australian and Brazilian iron ore mines accounted for most of the lowest-cost iron ore production. Some Chinese producers had costs that were higher than the current iron ore price, partly because the quality of the iron ore deposits was relatively low. However, some of these mines remained open, possibly reflecting their vertical integration with steel mills, which were often state owned and accounted for a significant share of employment in particular regions.
Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that conditions in the labour market had been somewhat weaker than had been expected. The unemployment rate had increased to 5.9 per cent in February and measures of underemployment – which capture workers who are willing and available to work more hours – had remained high. Overall, the ongoing spare capacity in the labour market was contributing to low wage growth outcomes.
Employment had declined a little in February but had increased by around 1 per cent over the preceding year; all of this growth had been in part-time employment. Employment outcomes had been strongest in Victoria, which had also experienced an increase in population growth following a rise in migration from other states and overseas. In contrast, employment outcomes had been weaker in New South Wales; employment conditions appeared to have remained strong in metropolitan Sydney, but had been relatively weak in regional areas. Employment outcomes in Western Australia were no longer deteriorating. Members noted that the adjustment of the labour market to changes in the locations and industries that were driving employment growth had not significantly boosted measures of structural unemployment. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand at the state level had been consistent with outcomes in the labour force data and continued to imply that aggregate employment growth could rise over coming months. However, members noted that these forward-looking indicators had been suggesting more positive employment outcomes than had been realised for some time.
Overall, GDP was likely to have expanded at a moderate rate in the March quarter. Early indications were that supply disruptions following Cyclone Debbie in Queensland and the floods in northern New South Wales were likely to be concentrated in coal production and some specific crops. At the time of the meeting, the overall effect on consumer prices and domestic demand growth, including from repairs and rebuilding, was not expected to be large. Survey measures of business conditions and confidence had remained above average.
Members observed that most of the large projects associated with the expansion of iron ore and coal production capacity in Australia had been completed. The remaining decline in mining investment expected over the subsequent year or so would, members noted, largely reflect the completion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. Members discussed the high and rising supply of LNG into the Asian market over coming years and the implications for spot prices and Australian export volumes.
Indicators of household consumption had been a little weaker than expected in early 2017. The value of retail sales had fallen slightly in February, following average growth in January, and households' perceptions of their personal finances had declined to below-average levels. Retail price inflation had remained subdued, partly because competition had remained strong across the retail sector. Members noted that utilities prices were expected to put some upward pressure on retail costs, but that retail rents had been flat – or rising very marginally at most – across the major cities.
Conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary significantly by region. Housing price growth had been strongest in detached housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne and some indicators for the established housing markets in these cities had picked up in the preceding couple of months. In contrast, housing market conditions in Perth had remained weak, although there were signs that prices there may be stabilising. Vacancy rates had been increasing, particularly in Perth. Strong growth in the supply of new apartments was continuing to drive a wedge between price growth for apartments and detached houses in Melbourne and Brisbane. Private residential building approvals had rebounded in February; the large pipeline of work to be done was expected to support dwelling investment over the subsequent year or two.
Growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers had moderated slightly over the preceding six months, while growth in housing credit to investors had increased, although investor loan approvals had declined in February. Most of the increase in lending to investors had occurred in New South Wales and Victoria, which was consistent with the pattern of housing market activity. Members observed that the growth of housing credit to investors had initially moderated in response to the announcement by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) of a 10 per cent benchmark for investor credit growth in late 2014. In addition, the share of lending with high loan-to-valuation ratios had fallen. However, growth in investor credit had increased steadily since early 2016, despite the fact that banks had tightened lending standards and, on average, increased the margin between interest rates on investor housing loans and those on loans to owner-occupiers.
Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with the observation that conditions generally had been relatively stable over the preceding month.
Members noted that the increase in the US federal funds rate in March had been well anticipated. Despite two increases in the federal funds rate since late 2016, financial conditions in the United States had eased slightly, including via a depreciation of the US dollar, a decline in corporate bond yields and a rise in equity prices. At the March meeting, the assessment by members of the Federal Open Market Committee of the appropriate course for monetary policy was unchanged, with the median projection being for two further increases in the policy rate in 2017. Market pricing continued to suggest a slightly slower pace of tightening than the official projections.
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan had both left their policies unchanged in the prior month, while noting that domestic economic activity was improving. Market pricing implied that participants did not expect a further reduction in the ECB's deposit rate and, indeed, had some expectation of a small increase in the deposit rate by mid 2018.
There had been a marginal tightening in money market conditions in China in March, via another small increase in the cost of various lending facilities provided by the People's Bank of China. The renminbi had depreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, moving in line with the US dollar; this took it to its lowest level on a trade-weighted basis since 2014. Official reserve assets in China had stabilised around US$3 trillion and there appeared to have been some net private inflows of capital of late.
Conditions in sovereign bond markets had not changed noticeably over the prior month. The United Kingdom's formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union had had little effect on financial market prices in the United Kingdom, with both the value of the pound and gilt yields little changed.
In Australian financial markets, government bond yields had been little changed over the prior month. Australian equity prices had increased and were noticeably higher than a year earlier. Prices of resource companies had declined in the preceding few months while prices of shares in other sectors, particularly the financial sector, had increased over March.
The Australian dollar was broadly unchanged against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month, but had appreciated over the previous year.
Members discussed the recently announced increases in housing lending rates. The increases had been mainly in response to prudential measures introduced by APRA in 2014 to slow the growth in lending to housing investors and preceded measures announced by APRA in late March to restrain the growth of interest-only lending. Funding costs had not changed significantly. At the point that these latest increases were to come into effect, the cumulative increase since November would be an average of around 25 basis points for loans to investors with scheduled repayments of principal and interest, and only a slight increase for loans of this type to owner-occupiers. In addition, by April the four major banks all would have introduced higher interest rates for interest-only lending, with an average premium relative to principal and interest lending of around 15 basis points. As a result, investors with interest-only loans on variable rates would be facing benchmark interest rates similar to those that applied to the same product about three years earlier. Members noted that the margin between lending rates on principal and interest loans and interest-only loans had increased by more for owner-occupiers than for investors.
Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities by Australian financial entities had been strong in the preceding few months, although this represented a small share of total lending and remained well below pre-financial crisis levels.
Members noted that pricing in financial markets indicated no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the April meeting or over the remainder of the year.
Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the stability of the financial system.
Risks related to household debt and the housing market more generally had increased over the preceding six months. However, the nature of those risks differed across the country, according to the varying conditions and activity in local markets. Although credit to the household sector had been growing modestly relative to history, growth had been faster than income growth and the aggregate debt-to-income ratio for households had increased.
Nevertheless, indicators of financial stress in the household sector remained contained. Low interest rates and improved lending standards over recent years had been supporting households' ability to service debt, and households on average had continued to build repayment buffers. Members noted, however, that some households with home loans appeared to have little or no buffer of excess mortgage repayments and could be vulnerable if household income were lower than expected. This observation emphasised the importance of realistic assessments of household expenses and prudent lending standards for mitigating risks to both financial stability and macroeconomic outcomes.
Members discussed the recent actions taken by APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to support prudent lending practices. These actions had been focused particularly on interest-only lending, serviceability assessments and responsible lending practices. APRA's guidance had included limits on the share of interest-only loans in new housing loans and a requirement that banks impose strict limits on new interest-only lending at high loan-to-valuation ratios. Members recognised that the calibration of this guidance was not precise or straightforward. Developments needed to be kept under review and, depending on how the system responds to the various measures, members noted that the Council of Financial Regulators would consider further measures if needed.
Members observed that a number of factors make interest-only loans attractive in the Australian context. In particular, interest-only loans allow investors to take greatest advantage of particular features of the tax system, while the availability of offset accounts provides some owner-occupiers with opportunities to manage liquidity risks that might be associated with irregular income, for example.
Members noted that some banks had curtailed lending to some segments of the housing market, notably the Brisbane apartment market, where the supply of apartments was expected to increase significantly, raising the risks associated with oversupply. Reports of settlement failures had remained isolated. Members also noted the higher interest rates facing most investors, especially those with interest-only loans.
Developments in commercial property markets mirrored the geographic pattern seen in residential property markets. Conditions had been strengthening in Sydney and Melbourne but were weaker elsewhere. Valuations were generally high, however, and posed some risk to leveraged investors if prices were to decline sharply. Members were briefed on APRA's recent review of commercial property lending. This review revealed some instances of weak underwriting standards and poor monitoring of risk profiles among lenders; several Australian banks had since tightened their lending standards.
Members observed that, in contrast to the growing risks faced by the household sector, vulnerabilities in the non-financial business sector remained low. Outside Western Australia, business failure rates had declined. Profitability had been supported by higher earnings for resource-related firms, following the increase in commodity prices. Gearing ratios and other measures of the strength of businesses' balance sheets had generally been around their historical averages.
Members noted that the Australian banks continued to be well placed to manage the challenges they faced. The banks remained highly profitable in the second half of 2016 and the performance of their assets had been little changed. Their capital ratios and liquidity structures had strengthened over the prior year or so. Members noted that further increases in capital could be expected once APRA finalises its new standards to ensure that banks are 'unquestionably strong', and that banks were expected to be able to accumulate any required additional capital. The domestic banks had also taken steps to reduce the risk profile of their balance sheets, having divested some higher-risk and low-return assets in recent years. In addition, they had tended to slow the growth in their exposures to commercial property, particularly residential and land development lending. Some risks from their businesses in New Zealand had probably diminished, as global milk prices had risen, although risks related to housing markets in New Zealand remained.
Members observed that the nature of the risks to global financial stability had changed over the preceding six months as the economic outlook had improved and longer-term interest rates had risen. In particular, there was an increased risk that future portfolio adjustments could prove disruptive. Prices of some assets had reached high levels, which could reverse if interest rates rose particularly quickly or if the outlook for growth in some economies were reassessed. Risks related to some international political developments had also increased over the preceding six months, although markets had generally reacted in an orderly manner so far.
Members noted that longstanding vulnerabilities remained in some banking systems overseas. Performance of the European banking sector had remained weak, weighed down by high levels of non-performing loans, relatively high cost bases and other legacy issues. Low profitability impeded these banks' ability to improve their capital positions. Risks also remained elevated in China. Debt levels had continued to grow rapidly, particularly debt acquired through less regulated channels and possibly by higher-risk borrowers. Some measures of loan performance had deteriorated. Slowing growth in profits in some industries could impinge on some borrowers' capacity to service their debts.
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent data had provided more confidence that global growth was rising and that the pick-up was broadly based across both developed and emerging economies. Growth in both global trade and industrial production had increased and indicators of global consumer and business sentiment had been above average. Further reductions in spare capacity were expected in the major advanced economies. However, various policy, financial and geopolitical risks would still need to be closely watched.
Headline inflation had increased in most economies, mainly reflecting higher oil prices over the first part of 2016. Members noted that, while the effect of higher oil prices might dissipate, further reductions in spare capacity in the major advanced economies could be expected to see a lift in inflation.
The improvement in global economic conditions had contributed to higher commodity prices overall. This was expected to have provided a significant boost to Australia's national income in the March quarter. However, iron ore prices had fallen since late March, which suggested that the Australian terms of trade were still likely to decline in the period ahead from their recent highs.
Recent data suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow moderately at the beginning of 2017, supported by the low level of interest rates. Indicators of household consumption had been a little weaker than expected, which was consistent with softer conditions in the labour market. Although forward-looking indicators of labour demand continued to suggest an increase in employment growth over the period ahead, this had been true for some time without leading to an improvement in labour market conditions. Most measures of business confidence were at, or above, average and non-mining business investment had risen over the prior year in parts of the country less affected by the transition following the end of the mining investment boom. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had assisted the economy during this transition; an appreciating exchange rate would complicate the adjustment process.
Conditions in housing markets continued to vary considerably across the country. The established markets in Sydney and Melbourne appeared to have strengthened further, but housing prices had continued to fall in Perth. The additional supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the subsequent couple of years in the eastern capital cities was expected to put some downward pressure on growth in apartment prices and rents, particularly in Brisbane.
Growth in housing credit continued to outpace growth in household incomes, suggesting that the risks associated with the housing market and household balance sheets had been rising. Recently announced supervisory measures were designed to help mitigate these risks by reinforcing prudent lending standards and ensuring that loan serviceability was appropriate for current conditions. Less reliance on interest-only housing loans was also expected to increase the resilience of household balance sheets. However, it would take some time to assess fully the effects of the recent pricing changes and the increased supervisory attention.
Headline inflation was expected to pick up over 2017 to be above 2 per cent. However, the rise in underlying inflation was expected to be more gradual; wage growth and broader measures of labour cost pressures remained subdued and competition in the retail sector continued to be strong.
Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. The Board judged that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted careful monitoring over coming months.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell for a second straight month in March and consumer prices dropped for the first time in just over a year, underscoring the magnitude of the loss of economic growth momentum in the first quarter.
But with the labor market near full employment, Friday's weak reports failed to change views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again in June. Economists expect a rebound in both retail sales and monthly inflation. 
""For the Fed, the underlying momentum is more important in terms of policy decisions, and that looks to be strong, supported by a tightening labor market, rising incomes and high consumer confidence,"" said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month after a 0.3 percent decrease in February, which was the first and biggest decline in nearly a year. Compared to March last year retail sales increased 5.2 percent. 
Economists had forecast retail sales slipping 0.1 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5 percent last month after falling 0.2 percent in February. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Despite last month's rebound in core retail sales, consumer spending likely braked sharply in the first quarter after growing at a brisk 3.5 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016. The apparent slowdown in consumption is partly blamed on the late disbursement of income tax refunds by the government as it sought to combat fraud.
The Atlanta Fed lowered its first-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.5 percent rate, which would be the weakest performance in three years. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
With job growth averaging 178,000 per month in the first quarter, the anticipated slowdown in GDP likely understates the health of the economy. First-quarter GDP tends to be weaker because of calculation problems that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve.
Retail sales last month were undercut by a 1.2 percent tumble in receipts at auto dealerships. It was the third straight monthly drop in auto sales. Lower gasoline prices also undermined retail through a 1.0 percent drop in receipts at service stations.
POCKETS OF STRENGTH
A 1.5 percent plunge in sales at building material stores was also a drag. But electronics and appliances store sales recorded their biggest rise since June 2015. 
Receipts at clothing stores increased by the most in a year, despite declining mall traffic and increased competition from online retailers, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Retailers like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy's Inc are scaling back on brick-and-mortar operations.
U.S. financial markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dropped 0.3 percent in March, the first decline in 13 months and biggest decrease since January 2015 amid falling prices for gasoline and mobile phone services, which offset rising rents and food costs.
The CPI nudged up 0.1 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, the CPI rose 2.4 percent, slowing from February's 2.7 percent increase. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, fell 0.1 percent, the first and biggest drop since January 2010, after rising 0.2 percent in February. The year-on-year increase in the core CPI slowed to 2.0 percent, the smallest advance since November 2015, from 2.2 percent in February. 
""We don't think this is enough to cause the Fed to swerve from their stated desire to continue gradually increasing the funds rate, though it may embolden the doves' rhetoric,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is at 1.8 percent. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year. 

A 6.2 percent drop in gasoline prices was the biggest factor in the monthly decline in the CPI, which was also weighed down by a record 7.0 percent plunge in the cost of wireless telephone services.

The Commerce Department said on Friday business inventories rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in January.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories climbed 0.3 percent in February instead of the 0.4 percent increase reported in an advance report published last month. Retail inventories jumped 0.9 percent in January. 
Motor vehicle inventories advanced 1.0 percent after surging 2.5 percent the prior month amid declining sales. Retail
inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, were unchanged for a second consecutive month as reported in March. 
Inventory investment added one percentage point to the economy's 2.1 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth
quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth after a drag that lasted more than a year.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is estimating GDP increasing at a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is forecasting inventories subtracting about a full percentage point from first-quarter growth.
Business sales rose 0.2 percent in February after increasing 0.3 percent in January. At February's sales pace, it would take 1.35 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from January.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports were expected to rise for a fourth straight month in March thanks to solid global demand, while imports were seen likely to gain at their fastest in three years as oil prices rose, a Reuters poll found. 
Exports were seen likely to grow 6.7 percent in March from a year earlier after they surged 11.3 percent in February, the poll of 18 analysts showed. 
That gain was the most in more than two years and included a rebound from January's Lunar New Year slowdown.
A recovery in oil prices and a weak yen pushed Japan's imports up 10.4 percent from a year ago, the fastest increase since March 2014 when they rose an annual 18.2 percent.
This would result in trade surplus at 575.8 billion yen, a third straight month of surplus.
""We see exports remaining on a rising trend on the back of global economic recovery,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Research Institute. ""Exports for January-March likely surpassed that of the previous quarter.""
Demand for electronics components from Asian nations likely continued to bolster Japan's exports, analysts said. 
The finance ministry will publish the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday). 
Japan and the United States will start an economic dialogue on April 18, with Tokyo seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance.
The Trump administration's protectionist policy statements have worried Japanese leaders, given Japan's export-reliant economy.

Discussions at the dialogue next week will focus more on setting a ""framework"" for future talks rather than on specific industry issues, a White House official said.

Le Pen wants to drop the euro currency, a move that would throw the future of the European single currency into doubt, and vows to re-negotiate France's relationship with the European Union, promising a referendum on EU membership if those talks fail.
In an interview with newspaper Ouest-France, Le Pen described her 2.5 percent growth forecast by 2021 as ""extremely reasonable"". 
""From the moment I implement intelligent protectionism that will fight against unfair international competition, it will turn the economy around,"" Le Pen was quoted as saying, adding that growth will be accompanied by an increase in purchasing power.
France's economy, the second biggest in the euro zone, has not expanded at that rate since 2004. Hobbled by heavy regulation and high unemployment, French GDP growth in 2016 was an anemic 1.1 percent and is predicted to reach 1.5 percent this year.
Le Pen portrays herself as the champion of French workers, promising to protect them from what she has called ""anarchic globalization"". 
Among her policy pledges is a tax on French companies that hire foreign workers and a requirement that retailers stock a certain percentage of French products.
Le Pen also said in the interview that France would have the backing of member states including Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece when she re-negotiates EU treaties. 
The leader of the anti-immigration, euroskeptic party said EU members were suffering under the weight of Brussels bureaucracy.

Opinion polls project Le Pen winning the first round of voting on April 23 but losing in the second round a fortnight later, most likely to independent challenger Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister under outgoing President Francois Hollande.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment aid unexpectedly fell last week and consumer sentiment rose early this month amid continued optimism over household finances, suggesting a sharp slowdown in job growth in March was an aberration.
While other data on Thursday showed producer prices falling in March for the first time in seven months, prices recorded their biggest year-on-year increase in five years. The reports pointed to a steadily firming economy and could encourage the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates again in June.
""Today's reports are generally consistent with the Fed's narrative that the economy is close to full employment and some inflationary pressures are building,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended April 8, the Labor Department said. That was the third straight weekly decline in claims and left them near a 44-year low of 227,000 hit in February.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 110 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245,000 last week.
The low level of claims suggests that a sharp slowdown in job growth in March was a blip and the labor market is tightening. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May. 
""Temporarily higher mid-March readings probably in large part reflected weather drags that were apparent in the March employment report, and much stronger results in the first half of April are pointing to a reacceleration in payrolls in April,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
A separate survey from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index rising to a reading of 98.0 early this month from 96.9 in March. 
The survey's current economic conditions index jumped to its highest level since 2000, with an increase in the share of households reporting an improvement in their finances.
SPENDING MAY ACCELERATE
Strong consumer sentiment could suggest an acceleration in consumer spending in the second quarter after an apparent slowdown at the start of the year. A surge in confidence in late 2016 and early this year failed to translate into stronger spending.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as investors assessed comments by President Donald Trump to the Wall Street Journal late on Wednesday that the dollar was ""getting too strong"" and that he liked a ""low-interest rate policy.""
U.S. Treasury yields briefly fell to a five-month low, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point last month and has said it expected to increase borrowing costs at least twice more this year. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1 percent last month, the first decline since August. The PPI gained 0.3 percent in February. 
Despite last month's dip in prices, the PPI shot up 2.3 percent in the 12 months through March. That was the biggest increase since March 2012 and followed a 2.2 percent jump in February. 
A 0.1 percent dip in prices for final demand services accounted for three quarters of the drop in the PPI in March. Energy prices fell 2.9 percent, the first decline since August, with the cost of gasoline tumbling 8.3 percent. 
With oil prices rising in recent days and recovering nearly all of March's losses, monthly producer prices are likely to resume their upward trend. 
The dollar's 2.8 percent drop this year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners is also keeping the underlying trend in producer prices elevated.
Final demand goods less food and energy increased 0.4 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February.

The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary April consumer sentiment index rose to 98.0, up from a final March reading of 96.9. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 96.5.
""Consumer sentiment inched upward in early April mainly due to more favorable views of current economic conditions,"" the survey's chief economist Richard Curtin said in a statement.
Consumers' outlook on the economy improved following Republican Donald Trump's presidential win in November. Some consumers have hoped for more jobs and higher income due to tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser regulations that Trump pledged during his campaign. 
The survey's gauge on current economic conditions climbed to 115.2 in early April, which was the highest since November 2000. This compared with the March final reading of 113.2 and a forecast of 112.4.
Consumer sentiment is seen as a predictor of consumer spending which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. 
""The continued improvement in the headline index since November remains consistent with strong consumer sentiment, although this confidence has yet to translate into stronger activity for the household sector, with retail sales and personal consumption data for January and February coming in on the soft side,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Blerina Uruçi wrote in a research note. 
The survey's barometer on consumer expectations edged up to 86.9 from the March final figure of 86.5 and a forecast of 86.0.
There remained a sharp divide on the outlook on the economy based on political party affiliation, Curtin said.
Republicans in general anticipated better times ahead, while Democrats on average were gloomy. This resulted in a 50.5-point gap between the two groups' economic outlook, according to the latest University of Michigan survey.

Consumers' inflation outlook in a year and five years was unchanged from late March at 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.

With oil prices rising in recent days and recovering nearly all of March's losses on reports Saudi Arabia wants to extend production cuts enacted in January for another six months, monthly producer prices are likely to resume their upward trend.
Overall domestic price pressures are rising, with most consumer inflation measures now above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The increases reflect in part, an ebb the dollar's rally and strengthening domestic demand.

Core PPI increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months through March after advancing 1.8 percent in February.
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.1 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in February. Inpatient healthcare services gained 0.2 percent last month after a similar rise in February.
The cost of outpatient care increased 0.2 percent, while physician care rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged in February. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index.

Wholesale food prices increased 0.9 percent following a 0.3 percent rise in February.

Non-oil domestic exports were seen rising 10.4 percent year-on-year last month, a median forecast of 10 economists showed.
Singapore has been among a number of export-reliant regional economies to benefit from a general uptick in global demand in recent months, with the city state particularly enjoying strong sales of its tech products.
""We see this trade recovery in the region as well as globally continuing, particularly for the electronics segment. We are seeing a global turnaround in the global IT cycle, and that would continue to lend support exports of electronics, particularly semiconductors"", said ANZ economist Weiwen Ng.
The positive impulse saw exports growth in February hit their strongest in 5 years, with a sharp jump in shipments to China. 
Still, some analysts are more circumspect about the outlook and point to a low base from a year ago for the sizable jump in recent shipments.
Indeed, on a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, however, non-oil domestic exports were seen down 6.4 percent, the poll found.
""The numbers we saw end of last year and beginning of this year are exaggerated,"" said Mizuho Bank senior economist Vishnu Varathan. 
""From here on it is going to struggle to stay in the double digit region. It is going to converge to a mid single digit growth,"" Varathan added.

Washington's improving ties with Beijing were underscored when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Wednesday that he would not declare China a currency manipulator as he had pledged to do on his first day in office.
The comments were an about-face from Trump's campaign promises, which had rattled China and other Asian exporters, and came days after his first meeting with President Xi Jinping where he pressed China to help rein in North Korea.
China's exports rose at the fastest pace in a little more than two years in March, climbing 16.4 percent from a year earlier in a further sign that global demand is improving, the customs office reported on Thursday. 
""There are increased signs of warming up in the global economy"", which helped China's steady growth in the first quarter, Yan Pengcheng, a spokesman for the country's top economic planning agency, told a news conference.
Import growth remained strong at 20.3 percent, driven by the country's voracious appetite for oil, copper, iron ore, coal and soybeans, whose volumes all surged from February despite worries about rising inventories.
China's crude oil imports hit a record high of nearly 9.2 million barrels per day, overtaking the United States.
The stronger trade data reinforced the growing view that economic activity in China has remained resilient or is even picking up, adding oomph to a global manufacturing revival, though analysts say growth in imports could slow.
""Right now domestic demand is still quite stable and robust. But the ultimate driver actually is property investment (which) we expect to slow,"" Nomura economist Yang Zhao said. 
Zhao expects import growth will moderate to the high-single digits in the second quarter. 
Imports had surged 38 percent in February while exports unexpectedly dipped, but China's data in the first two months of the year can be heavily skewed by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, when many businesses shut for a week or more.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected March exports to have increased by 3.2 percent from a year earlier, a rebound from a 1.3 percent drop in February.
Imports had been forecast to rise 18.0 percent, after surging 38.1 percent in February.
China reported a trade surplus of $23.93 billion for March.
Analysts had expected the trade balance to return to a surplus of $10.0 billion in March, after it reported its first trade gap in three years in February.
SOLID FIRST QUARTER TRADE PERFORMANCE
China's exports in the first quarter of the year rose 8.2 percent from the same period last year, while imports surged by 24.0 percent. The first-quarter surplus was $65.61 billion.
Despite the strong readings, China's customs office said the trade situation remains complicated and that challenges facing exporters are not short-term. 
A shadow has fallen over the trade relationship between China and the United States, its largest export market, as Trump has railed against the massive trade imbalance between the two countries, which was $347 billion in favor of China last year. 
China's exports to the U.S. rose 19.7 percent in March on-year, while imports from the U.S. rose 15.1 percent. 
But China's trade surplus with U.S. remained high in the first quarter at $49.6 billion, down only slightly from $50.57 billion in the year-ago period.
Customs spokesman Huang Songping said on Thursday that better communication between China and the United States will benefit trade and investment between the two countries. 
Trump urged Xi to help reduce the gap at last week's meeting, with the countries agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing China's surplus with the United States.
""The risk of an explicit trade war has waned subsequent to the Trump-Xi summit,"" economists at ANZ said in a note.
But uncertainties remain, with rising tension on the Korean peninsula leading Trump to link trade negotiations to China's actions with regards to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Despite Trump's comments backing away from labeling China a currency manipulator, many analysts reckon the new administration is just beginning to flex its trade muscles with Beijing and other major trading partners. 
The U.S. launched a probe to determine whether imports of Chinese aluminum foil should be subject to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on March 27. 
China's economic growth remained stable in the first quarter of 2017, but it's too early to tell whether it can be sustained, the National Development and Reform Commision (NDRC) said on Thursday.
China will report first-quarter growth data on April 17, along with March industrial output, investment and retail sales.
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast China's economy likely grew by a solid 6.8 percent in the quarter, the same pace as the previous quarter, due to sustained government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying housing market which is feeding a months-long construction boom.
But it is widely expected to lose steam later in the year as the impact of earlier stimulus starts to fade and as local authorities step up their battle to rein in hot housing prices.

If sustained, stronger exports could cushion some of the impact from any softening in domestic demand.

The March reading marked the first slowdown in annual inflation in nearly a year. In February it rose to the highest level since August 2012 and it was the first time since September 2012 that it surpassed the European Central Bank's stability target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2017 02:23AM ET</span>","BOK holds rates, upgrades economic outlook with hawkish tone","By Christine Kim and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank raised its growth outlook for this year and kept interest rates unchanged at a record low for a 10th straight month on Thursday, while its governor shifted policy to a more hawkish stance.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate  steady at 1.25 percent, in line with forecasts from 21 analysts surveyed in a Reuters poll.
A majority of analysts see the central bank on hold for the rest of the year and some see tightening beginning next year. 
""Right now, I don't think the BOK is looking at a rate cut at all. In the second half of the year there may be talk of an extra budget, but to the BOK... rate cuts will not be on the table,"" said Oh Chang-sob, a fixed-income strategist at Korea Investment & Securities. 
In its quarterly revision of economic forecasts, the BOK raised its GDP growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent previously announced. Inflation this year is now seen at 1.9 percent, versus 1.8 percent announced in January.
BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the outlook was revised up on better-than-expected economic conditions from improving exports and a higher base thanks to fourth-quarter GDP growth that was revised up to 0.5 percent on-quarter from 0.4 percent.
""When considering the growth and inflation path going forward, it is true the need for rate cuts has diminished,"" said Lee. ""However we will keep an accommodative stance to support economic growth.""
Lee noted South Korea's economy could face downside risks at any time from something unexpected, while the outlook for the jobs market was ""not all positive."" [KRUNR=ECI]
The revised outlook would have been much higher, the BOK said later, had it not been for China taking retaliatory measures against the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile radar system in South Korea, which would slice 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth.
Chang Min, a director general at the BOK, told a media briefing the growth scenario could worsen or improve depending on the course of bilateral relations after South Korea's new president takes office following the May 9 election.
Market players boosted the won  after the governor's remarks, taking the currency to 1,129.2 per dollar as of 0550 GMT (01:50 a.m. EDT), up more than 1 percent versus its previous close.
Lee remained wary of geopolitical risks around North Korea, saying it was too early to say what effect they will have on the economy.
Foreign journalists visiting Pyongyang were told early on Thursday to prepare for ""a big and important event"", with tensions high over the possibility North Korea would test weapons even as a U.S. carrier group steamed toward the Korean peninsula.
Policymakers had fretted over whether South Korea would be named as a currency manipulator in a U.S. Treasury report, although on balance they are confident it is unlikely.A local currency trader said concerns over the report had ""completely eased"" after U.S. President Trump said in a media interview that China would not be named a currency manipulator.
Consumer price growth in South Korea picked up at the fastest pace in nearly five years in March as the prices of fresh food and services rose, signaling a rebound in domestic demand after months of weakening consumer sentiment amid a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of President Park Geun-hye.

Rising household debt remains an issue for the central bank, as previous interest rate cuts by the BOK have been identified as a key reason behind feverish borrowing. The BOK said on Thursday borrowing from non-bank institutions continued to grow rapidly.The central bank did not hold a rate-setting meeting in March as it has reduced the number of such meetings, starting this year, to eight from 12.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday import prices fell 0.2 percent last month, the largest drop since August, after a 0.4 percent increase in February. 
That lowered the year-on-year increase in import prices to 4.2 percent from 4.8 percent in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices slipping 0.2 percent last month. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report.
The drop in import prices is unlikely to be sustained with oil prices pushing higher in recent days amid rising geopolitical tensions following last week's U.S. missile strike on Syria and reports that Saudi Arabia wants to extend production cuts enacted in January for another six months.
Despite weak imported price pressures, domestic inflation is rising. Most consumer inflation measures have pushed above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. A report on Thursday is expected to show producer prices unchanged in March, but rising 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
Prices for imported petroleum fell 3.6 percent last month, the biggest drop since August, after increasing 1.3 percent in February. Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent the prior month. 
Import prices excluding petroleum have now increased for three straight months, in part reflecting an ebb in the dollar's rally. Prices for imported capital goods edged up 0.1 percent in March after rising 0.2 percent in February. 
Imported consumer goods prices excluding automobiles fell 0.2 percent last month after gaining 0.3 percent in February. The cost of imported food fell 0.7 percent last month after increasing 1.0 percent in February.
The report also showed export prices rose 0.2 percent
in March after advancing 0.3 percent the prior month. That lifted the year-on-year increase to 3.6 percent, the biggest rise since December 2011, from a 3.2 percent gain in February. 
Prices for agricultural exports increased 0.9 percent last
month, led by gains in meat and nut prices. Agricultural prices rose 5.3 percent in the 12 months to March, the largest increase since June 2013. 

Higher soybean prices accounted for the bulk of the year-on-year increase in agricultural export prices in March.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, pressured by fears that Chinese steel production is outweighing demand and threatening a glut of the metal later this year.
A renaissance in China's steel industry has been a major driver of the world's second-largest economy in recent quarters, helping generate the strongest profit growth in years and adding to a reflationary pulse across the global manufacturing sector.
But after cranking out as much metal as possible in recent months, Chinese steel mills are now starting to cut prices, threatening to snuff out a bull market that had pushed prices of some steel construction products to their highest since 2014.
China's steel sector has been under particular scrutiny by its major trading partners, with the Trump administration saying Beijing's support for such industries has led to over-production and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets.
Still, while China's producer price inflation has likely passed its peak, it is likely to remain high for a bit longer, keeping profits at a reasonable level, ANZ said in a note.
That should give China's central bank confidence to continue with gradual monetary policy tightening as it tries to coax companies to reduce high levels of debt, ANZ economists said, predicting further hikes in short-term interest rates this year.
China's producer price index (PPI) rose 7.6 percent in March from a year earlier, still elevated but in line with expectations and easing from 7.8 percent in February, a 9-year high, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a softer reading as a torrid rally in China's commodity markets showed signs of correcting, and on expectations that measures to cool the country's overheated housing market would eventually slow demand for steel and other building materials.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose just 0.3 percent, the smallest increase since September 2016 and half the pace seen in February.
China's factory gate prices had only turned positive on year-on-year basis last September, after falling for nearly five years, leaving many industrial firms saddled with idle capacity and less cash flow to service their debts.
CONSUMER INFLATION REMAINS BENIGN
China's consumer inflation rate has been far milder, edging up to 0.9 percent in March, from 0.8 percent in February.
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index (CPI), fell by 4.4 percent.
Non-food inflation inched up to 2.3 percent, with costs for health care, housing, transportation and communication all rising, suggesting stronger demand from an increasingly wealthy and rapidly aging population. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted March consumer inflation would edge up to 1.0 percent, but remain well within the central bank's comfort zone.
Still-modest consumer inflation and moderating producer prices will give policymakers room to continue with their campaign to reduce risks in the financial system after years of debt-fueled stimulus.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) last month completed its most rigorous quarterly inspection of the nation's banks to date to get a better idea of the problems it is facing.
The China Banking Regulatory Commision (CBRC) has told banks to conduct ""self inspections"" so it can understand the amount of leverage in the banking system and prevent lenders from hiding the true extent of sour loans, three sources told Reuters on Monday.
The PBOC has raised interest rates on money market and special short- and medium-term loans several times already this year to encourage companies to reduce debt.
ANZ expects another two 10-basis point hikes in the 7-day reserve repo rate and other medium-term rate hikes for the rest of the year, though analysts expect the PBOC to tread cautiously to avoid crimping economic growth. 
COMMODITY PRICES LOSING STEAM
Similar to previous months, much of the annual surge in producer inflation in March was largely driven by higher prices of raw materials for steelmaking products such as iron ore and coking coal, which are benefiting from a construction boom. 
But China's months-long commodities rally is showing signs of crumbling. Steel futures fell 5 percent on Friday, their steepest single-day drop in two months. 
Top listed steelmaker Baoshan Iron & Steel (SS:600019) (Baosteel) said on Monday it has cut prices for May delivery, ending a long streak of price hikes. Baosteel usually sets the tone for the industry.
Adding to easing producer inflation is a deceleration in global oil price growth, according to estimates by ING's chief Asia economist Tim Condon. China cut gasoline and diesel retail prices late last month by the most so far this year. 
The inflation readings will be followed by March trade data on Thursday, bank lending in coming days, and industrial output, retail sales and investment on April 17.

China's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) will also be released on the 17th, and is expected to show resilient growth at the start of 2017.

In a national survey that covered nearly 16,000 firms with fewer than 500 employees, more than 60 percent said they expect more revenue in 2017 than last year, and around 40 percent anticipated expanding their workforce.
A third of firms said they had added workers in 2016, with fewer than 20 percent saying they had reduced employment.
The findings on employment were ""a positive note"" in a report that detailed a broader picture of businesses struggling to get the financing needed to expand, said a Federal Reserve official who worked on the study but was not authorized to speak on the record.
Steady national job growth and a 4.5 percent unemployment level have convinced Federal Reserve policymakers that the economy is near full employment, or perhaps even slightly beyond it. Though job growth slowed in March, the small business survey is a sign that hiring may continue since smaller firms are responsible for the bulk of U.S. hiring.
The NY Fed began surveying small businesses in 2014 but the project has since expanded into a national effort covering all 12 regional Fed districts.
Participants in the online survey were not randomly selected, but the results were weighted by firm size, geography and other factors to make it more representative.
The focus was on credit to small firms, and the results cited struggles among businesses owners to find funding. Problems were particularly acute among firms with less than a million dollars in annual revenue, a group that made up 70 percent of the sample. Two-thirds said they faced a shortfall in financing, and a quarter said they had dipped into personal finances to fund their businesses.
The smallest firms also struggled to get credit from large banks as opposed to credit unions or community institutions: fewer than half the financing applications to larger banks were approved.
""These challenges are particularly salient for the U.S. macroeconomy,"" the survey report concluded, since newer, smaller firms are the ones more likely to grow fast.

The researchers did not offer policy or regulatory changes that might improve small firms' financing options.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 118,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. That was the highest level since July and lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.8 percent after holding steady at 3.7 percent for four straight months.
Hiring, however, slipped to 5.3 million from 5.4 million in January. The hiring rate dipped to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent the prior month.
""It shows you that there is one of the most gigantic skills mismatches out there across the country that we have ever seen in history,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

The U.S. labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent, below the most recent Federal Reserve median forecast for full employment.

In the release of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.743 million in February from 5.625 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.626 million. 
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to increase to just 5.655 million.
The report has garnered more attention despite the lag on the data, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has cited the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.
Following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0610 from around 1.0611 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.2439 compared to 1.2434 previously, while USD/JPY was at 110.28 from 110.30 earlier.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday that industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc fell by 0.3 percent from January, but rose by 1.2 percent year-on-year.
Both figures were lower than market expectations of increases of 0.1 percent in the month and of 2.0 percent from a year earlier.
January's output numbers were also cut to 0.3 percent month-on-month from an initially reported 0.9 percent and to 0.2 percent year-on-year from the 0.6 percent published a month ago.
The tepid production numbers contrast with bullish sentiment indicators.
According to the Markit purchasing manager index, regarded as a good guide to growth, euro zone businesses enjoyed their best quarter in six years at the start of 2017.
Investor sentiment in the euro zone improved more than expected in April to remain at the highest level in almost 10 years, data from the Frankfurt-based Sentix research group said on Monday.
The February output decrease was largely due to a 4.7 percent decline in energy production, perhaps reflecting mild weather, along with a 1.1 percent fall in output of non-durable consumer goods, a wide category including fresh vegetables and clothing.
Output of intermediate goods went up by 1.0 percent and of capital goods, such as machinery, by 0.9 percent. Durable consumer goods production was flat.
At national level, industrial production in Germany, the bloc's largest economy, grew by 0.8 percent, and in Italy by 1.0 percent. However, it fell in France and Spain, by 1.6 and 0.3 percent respectively.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 2.3% last month, in line with forecasts and the prior month’s reading. This remained the highest year on year level since September 2013.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose by 0.4% in March, compared to the prior month’s 0.7% advance and forecasts for a 0.3% gain.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.8% last month, lower than forecasts for a gain of 1.9% and the 2.0% advance in February.
The retail price index (RPI) increased 3.1% in March, after rising by 3.2% the previous month. Analysts had expected a gain of 3.2%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.3% in March, compared to a 1.1% advance in the prior month. Analysts had expected a 0.4% rise.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 3.4% in March, after rising by 3.5% the previous month. Economists had expected a gain of 3.5%.
Month-on-month, core RPI increased 0.3% last month, compared to February’s 1.1% rise.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.8% in March, below forecasts for a gain of 6.1% and following a 5.3% increase a month earlier. February’s data was revised from an initial 6.2% rise.
“Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, miscellaneous goods and services were the main upward contributors to change in the rate,” the ONS explained in the report.
“These were largely offset by a downward contribution from transport, particularly air fares and, to a lesser extent, motor fuels,” it added.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.2434 from around 1.2405 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8526 from 0.8540 earlier and GBP/JPY changed hands at 137.61, compared to 137.26 previously.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers are taking out debt at a far faster rate than their incomes or the economy are growing, and just as we may be hitting a peak in employment.
Add in rising interest rates courtesy of the Federal Reserve and you have the consumer sector - 70 percent of the U.S. economy - treading on thin and thinning ice.
U.S. consumers have run up over $1 trillion on credit cards, hitting a level not seen since January 2009 and up 6.2 percent from a year ago. For comparison, wages are up less than 3 percent and the economy is growing just under 2 percent a year.
Borrowers can only take on debt at twice the rate they increase the ability to service it for so long.
Student and auto loans are also at $1-trillion-plus levels and also growing about twice as fast as  wages or the economy.
To be sure, the percentage of disposable income the average household needs to service debt is hovering at about 10 percent, near all-time lows. So too are interest rates, and the thing about interest rate changes at very low levels is that small increases in absolute terms imply large increases in proportional ones.
Two important points about the backdrop:
Firstly, the Fed, happy to 'normalize' rates while it can, is likely to hike rates by a quarter percentage point twice more this year and, as indicated in the most recent interest-rate-setting meeting minutes, is also planning to begin the long and fraught process of unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Secondly, while labor market conditions are on par with their 2006-2007 peak, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital, momentum in the labor market is flagging. Friday’s jobs report showed payrolls expanding by just 98,000 in March, far less than expected, even as the jobless rate fell to just 4.5 percent.
Fed tightening, both balance sheet and interest rate variety, will both “only serve to strain liquidity conditions and raise debt service costs,” economist David Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff wrote in a note to clients.
“Nobody sees a recession coming, but history shows there is a 90 percent chance we see one in the coming year. Household debt loads are at cycle highs. Fed rate hikes mean interest costs will be absorbing funds that would otherwise be diverted to cyclical spending.”
The larger question is why workers in an economy with such low unemployment see the need to borrow aggressively, even if debt service levels indicate they have headroom.
A PROBLEM OF COMPOSITION
That’s because though many jobs have been created, they are not, by and large, jobs which allow for middle-class standards of living without spending above one’s income. The savings rate, at 5.5 percent, is well above the crazy 1.9 percent lows of 2005 but is hugely flattered by savings among the richest. Among the bottom 90 percent of Americans, the savings rate since the financial crisis has bumped along near zero, with the lion’s share made up by a 38 percent savings rate among the top 1 percent. (http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2016QJE.pdf)
This paints a picture of an economy badly out of balance. Those consumers taking on credit card debt, and auto debt, and student debt are not, by and large, doing so out of confidence and with prudence, but because of need. Wages simply have not risen enough for the typical household to make its way, and the fact that debt service has been kept artificially low only serves to underscore exactly how aberrant matters are.
This time, of course, won’t be like last time, and financial institutions are far less likely to be caught wrong-footed by a sudden downturn in the economy. That’s positive because we are far less likely, should we slide into recession, to face anything like a banking crisis. Banks are taking on less risk and monitoring the risks of their consumer-facing portfolios more closely.
This, though, means that banks will likely turn off the tap of credit availability more quickly, and with less provocation, then last time. Banks won’t be surprised by a recession, they will help cause it by tightening credit availability.
Data from the Federal Reserve’s survey of senior loan officers already shows a tightening is under way, with banks moving from making consumer debt easier to get to harder in the last six months. The last time we saw this pattern was 2008, and though the banks seem to be out in front of economic developments this time it will be of little comfort.
An economy this reliant on debt finance among a huge mass of households who can barely keep their heads above water is a risky proposition.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, showed that both year-ahead and three-year-ahead expectations fell to 2.7 percent, from 3 percent in February.
""Both declines were fairly broad-based, but largest among middle-aged and lower-educated household heads,"" the New York Fed said of the survey, which has been conducted since mid-2013. 
The measurements rose through December and January to their highest levels since mid-2015, before flattening in February and declining last month. Fed expectations for a gradual rise in inflation, after years below a target, have prompted policymakers to raise interest rates twice since December. [nL2N1GQ0M4]

The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group's euro zone index rose to 23.9 points, its highest level since August 2007. That exceeded the consensus forecast of 21.0 in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The index last month rose to 20.7 from 17.4 in February as concern dissipated that global political risks could end an economic upswing.
""The euro zone has emancipated itself from global tendencies, as the assessment for other world regions is by no means unequivocal,"" Sentix said in a statement.
""The euro zone continues to make further economic progress.
Before the important presidential election in France, the current situation index for the euro zone economy rose to the highest level since January 2008,"" it said.
France will elect a new president in a two-round ballot in April and May.
Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is expected to contest a run-off against far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Her plans to ditch the euro and hold a referendum on European Union membership have spooked many investors, who fear a ""Frexit"" after British voters chose last year to leave the EU.
Sentix said the current situation sub-index for the euro zone was 28.8, up from 23.8 in March.
An index tracking Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, rose to 35.3 in April from 34.1 in March.
""The strong euro zone, which has been fired up by an extremely expansive monetary policy, has not failed to leave its mark on the strongest euro economy,"" Sentix said, suggesting Germany was benefiting from a recovery in the currency bloc.
By contrast, the indices for the United States and Japan fell. Sentix linked the fall in the world's largest economy to U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The president talks a lot, but his messages are reaching investors increasingly less,"" Sentix wrote. ""Trump has become a killer of perspectives.""
U.S. stocks have risen to record highs since Trump's election after he vowed to remove some of the regulations introduced after the financial crisis and to boost spending on the military and infrastructure.
Sentix polled 1,035 investors on April 6 to 8.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account surplus stood at 2.81 trillion yen ($25.26 billion) in February, finance ministry data showed on Monday, the biggest surplus since March 2016.
The result, the 32nd straight month of current account surpluses, compares with economists' median forecast for a surplus of 2.62 trillion yen in a Reuters poll. This February's current account surplus was the largest on record for February.
The surplus reflected the trade balance rising as exports picked up pace after a Lunar New Year slowdown. The trade balance stood at 1.08 trillion yen in February, rebounding from a deficit of 853.4 billion yen the previous month.
Trade surpluses and currency valuations are in focus as U.S. President Donald Trump pursues an ""America First"" campaign in which he has accused big exporters such China, Germany and Japan of deliberately weakening their currencies to gain a competitive advantage.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso will hold their first round of economic talks in Tokyo next week to discuss issues ranging from macroeconomic policy, infrastructure investment and trade.
Nonetheless, in what appears to be a shift in emphasis, the Trump administration is touting a new term, ""currency misalignment,"" because it is seen as more significant than ""manipulation"" as a cause of trade deficits.
Income from overseas investment also helped boost the current account balance. The primary income account in February was 1.98 trillion yen, up from 1.27 trillion yen the previous month.
""It’s difficult to explain this month's current account surplus with just the (effects from) Lunar New Year,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.

""The income account is rising, too. There is upward pressure on current account balance.""

Payment card company Visa (N:V) said real-terms spending increased 0.9 percent year-on-year in the three months to March, the weakest calendar-quarter performance since late 2013 and down from 2.7 percent in the last quarter of 2016.
In March alone, spending dropped 0.7 percent compared with the previous month, after being flat in February.
The survey adds to a growing mass of indicators showing that rising inflation - caused in part by the pound's post-Brexit vote tumble - is crimping consumer spending, just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain's EU divorce talks.
""Our data suggests that consumer spending is beginning to slow from the strong levels seen in late 2016, as rising prices increasingly squeeze household purchasing power,"" said Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking at Thomson Reuters' London office on Friday, said he would keep a close eye on whether consumer demand weakens in line with the central bank's expectations.
Last week pension provider Scottish Friendly and the Social Market Foundation think tank said 46 percent of households plan to cut back on spending. More than half of these households blamed the rising cost of living.
The Office for National Statistics releases inflation data for March on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect consumer prices rose at a 2.3 percent annual pace, unchanged from February's rate.
Visa's monthly figures are based on spending on its credit and debit cards, which it says account for about a third of consumer spending in Britain. 

The figures are adjusted to strip out payments such as taxes that do not count as consumer spending, and to take account of the growing proportion of purchases made by card rather than with cash.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the embattled retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested labor market strength remained intact.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year.
In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007.
""The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn't reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000.
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent.
The dollar rose a three-week high against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose.
LABOR MARKET SLACK SHRINKING
Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, underscoring the labor market's strength, despite last month's stumble.
The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent.
But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June.
The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed's mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed's $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year.
New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a ""little pause"" in the central bank's rate hike plans.
""If today's decline in the unemployment rate doesn't reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March.
A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007.
The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent.
Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February.
Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations.

Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February's job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2017 10:19AM ET</span>","Canada job growth continues, unemployment rate edges higher","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian employers added a greater-than-expected 19,400 jobs in March and the unemployment rate edged up to 6.7 percent as more people sought work, Statistics Canada said on Friday in a report that suggested Canada's economy has finally turned the corner.
The surge in jobs, nearly quadruple analyst expectations, was the fourth straight monthly increase and adds to pressure on the Bank of Canada to sound more optimistic about the economy after a prolonged slump caused by low oil prices.
""While we share doubts about the sustainability of the recent pick-up in economic growth, the recent strength in employment will make it harder for the Bank of Canada to defend its dovishness on the economy and the need to keep interest rates low in the near future,"" David Madani, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.
Policymakers at the central bank are expected to keep interest rates on hold next week when they release their quarterly monetary policy report.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said last week the economy had a lot more room to grow, arguing it would be ""odd"" for policymakers to forget about downside risks just because some data had come in stronger than expected.
The jobs report looked strong even beyond the headline, with gains largely in full-time work and both manufacturing and construction adding employment. Statistics Canada said 18,400 full-time jobs and 1,000 part-time jobs were added.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 5,000 new positions and said the jobless rate would increase to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent in February.
The stronger-than-expected report strengthened the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart.
Still, there remain some signs of slack in the economy, with hourly wages of permanent employees up just 0.9 percent from March 2016. Muted wage pressure in the energy-producing province of Alberta, hard hit by the oil crash, was partly responsible.
Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, also noted the gains in self-employment give the report a softer tone.

""But from a very big picture standpoint the reality is employment just keeps chugging along. It seemed to break out of its funk some time around the middle part of last year and that trend looks to still be in place: that employment and the broader economy have broken out of a two-year lull,"" he said.

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent after falling 0.2 percent in January. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories increased 0.4 percent in February.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - also increased 0.4 percent in February.
A report this week showed inventories at factories increased 0.2 percent in February. Retail inventory data will be released next week. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) believes that inventories will subtract a full percentage point from first-quarter GDP.
Inventory investment added one percentage point to the economy's 2.1 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth after a drag that lasted more than a year.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP increasing at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter.

Sales at wholesalers increased 0.6 percent in February after rising 0.3 percent in January. At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.28 months to clear shelves, unchanged from January. The ratio has declined from 1.36 months in January and February last year, which was the highest since January 2009.

LONDON (Reuters) - Signs that Britain's economy is slowing as it prepares to leave the European Union hardened on Friday, as official data showed a surprise drop in industrial output and construction in February and a mixed performance for trade.
Sterling slid to a one-week low against the dollar after industrial output dipped 0.7 percent in February, worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which had pointed to a 0.2 percent increase. Output fell 0.3 percent in January.
A surprisingly large goods trade deficit - albeit distorted by imports of high-value goods like gold and aircraft - and a slump in construction added to evidence that Britain's economic growth rate peaked toward the end of last year.
Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that Friday's data suggested growth in the first three months of 2017 would slow to 0.5 percent from a robust 0.7 percent in the last three months of 2016.
There are already signs that rising inflation, caused in part by the pound's post-Brexit vote tumble, is crimping spending by consumers, the main drivers of the economy, just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain's EU divorce talks.
Underlining the caution among households, mortgage lender Halifax reported the weakest house price growth in nearly four years and a survey of recruiters showed staff were nervous about switching jobs ahead of Brexit.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking at Thomson Reuters' London office on Friday, said he would keep a close eye on whether consumer demand weakens in line with the central bank's expectations.
""Today's deluge of UK economic data was fairly disappointing and adds to the evidence that the economy has lost some momentum during Q1,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics.
The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggested manufacturing was not making up for a consumer spending slowdown as some economists had hoped following the pound's drop.
Output in manufacturing, a component of industrial output which accounts for about 10 percent of Britain's gross domestic product, unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent following a 1.0 percent fall in January, disappointing against forecasts for a 0.3 percent rise in the Reuters poll.
British manufacturing had a mixed performance in 2016, with economic growth driven mostly by the much larger services sector and consumer spending.
A closely-watched business survey on Monday showed British manufacturing lost some of its momentum in March, as export orders grew more slowly and demand for consumer goods faltered against a backdrop of rising inflation pressures.
Separate figures from the ONS showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to a five-month high of 12.461 billion pounds ($15.48 billion), compared with an upwardly revised 11.971 billion pounds in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 10.9 billion pounds.
The ONS also released figures for construction output in February, which slumped 1.7 percent on the month - the biggest drop in almost a year. 
The Reuters poll had pointed to stagnation on the month but output in February was dragged down by a 2.6 percent drop in housebuilding, the sharpest decline since mid-2015.
On the year, construction output rose just 0.5 percent in February - the weakest reading since March 2016 and a far cry from forecasts for a 1.9 percent rise.

""February's data shows that the construction sector has been one of the biggest losers from the Brexit vote,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. employers added the fewest number of workers in 10 months in March, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent pointed to a labor market that continues to tighten.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month as the retail sector shed employment for a second straight month, the Labor Department said on Friday, the fewest since last May. 
The economy enjoyed job gains in excess of 200,000 in January and February as unusually warm temperatures pulled forward hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction, leisure and hospitality. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast.
The unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.5 percent, the lowest level since May 2007. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent.
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The labor market is expected to hit full employment this year, which could 
drive faster wage growth.
The weak payrolls gain could raise concerns about the economy's health especially given signs that gross domestic product slowed to around a 1.0 percent annualized growth pace in the first quarter after rising at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March, which lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.7 percent.
Given rising inflation, the moderate job gains and gradual wage increases could still keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in June.
The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year. The Fed has said it would look at how to reduce its portfolio of bond holdings later this year.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. 
Economists attribute some of the improvement in the participation rate to President Donald Trump's electoral victory last November, which might have caused some unemployed Americans to believe their job prospects would improve. Trump has pledged to pursue pro-growth policies such as tax cuts and deregulation.
Construction jobs increased 6,000 after robust gains in January and February. Manufacturing employment gained 11,000 jobs as rising oil prices fuel demand for machinery. 
Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations.

Government payrolls increased 9,000 despite a freeze on the hiring of civilian workers.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose just 98,000 in March, compared to the rise of 219,000 a month earlier that was revised from the initial increase of 235,000. The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
On a positive note, the jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to 4.5%, from the prior 4.7%. Analysts had expected no change.
Average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.2%, compared to the prior increase of 0.3%, which was revised from a 0.2% advance. The reading was in line with consensus.
On an annualized basis, wages grew 2.7%.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer of the new job contracts than expected in March with a total of 89,000, compared to consensus expectations for 175,000. February’s number was revised down to 221,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 227,000.
Government payrolls increased by 9,000 last month, compared to the destruction of 2,000 public jobs created in February, revised from an initial gain of 8,000 positions.
The participation rate remained unchanged at 63.0% in March.
The U6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, decreased to 8.9% last month from February’s reading of 9.2%.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours remained unchanged at 34.3 in March after a downward revision to the previous month’s data. Analysts had forecast the number to remain unchanged from February’s initial reading of 34.4.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output surged in February and the trade surplus swelled as the engine room of Europe's largest economy fired on all cylinders to satisfy demand at home and abroad, assuaging angst about rising protectionism.
Describing an ""extraordinarily robust"" start to the year for industry, the Economy Ministry said output rose by 2.2 percent on the month, matching January's expansion. A Reuters poll had pointed to a dip of 0.1 percent in February.
Separate trade data showed a 0.8 percent rise in exports on the month in February, with imports falling 1.6 percent for a net expansion in Germany's trade surplus to 21.0 billion euros ($22.37 billion) from 18.9 billion euros in January.
""Today's reports on German industrial production and trade were both very strong,"" said JP Morgan economist Greg Fuzesi.
The robust German performance in February contrasted with an unexpected fall in British industrial output, adding to signs that British economic growth may have slowed as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. 
The German readings are the latest in a batch of strong indicators and will help Chancellor Angela Merkel burnish her economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election, when she will seek a fourth term.
In March, German business morale rose to its highest level in nearly six years, hardening indications that the German economy made a strong start to 2017, helped by rising global demand for cars and machinery.
Growth in services also accelerated further in March, pointing to healthy growth in the first quarter.. 
Yet analysts said the robust performance enjoyed by German industry at the start of this year may not last.
""All that glitters is not gold,"" said Stefan Kipar at BayernLB. He pointed to a 13.6 percent surge in construction in February - something he said would not be repeated in the coming months - as one reason to doubt the expansion was sustainable.
""Secondly, incoming orders are not so dynamic for an expansion in output to be a sure thing in the coming months.""
German industrial orders rose 3.4 percent on the month in February after a drop of 6.8 percent in January.
The German economy could yet be hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" protectionist rhetoric and political turbulence in Europe.

""The Brexit negotiations and a possible further weakening of the pound sterling, protectionist measures from the Trump administration and negative growth surprises from China pose a clear risk to the German economy,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production decreased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in February, worse than expectations for a gain of 0.2% and following a decline of 1.0% in the previous month, which was revised from an initial drop of 0.9%.
On an annualized basis, manufacturing production increased at rate of 3.3% in February, below forecasts for a 3.9% advance and after rising at a rate of 2.6% in January, which was revised from an initial 2.7% gain.
The report also showed that industrial production fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in February, compared to forecasts for a 0.2% increase and the 0.3% drop in the preceding month. January’s reading was revised from an initial 0.4% decline.
Year-on-year, industrial production gained 2.8% in February, below expectations for a 3.7% rise and following the 3.3% advance (initially 3.2%) registered a month earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households' inflation expectations have risen for the first time in nearly two years, a central bank survey showed, suggesting consumers are taking notice of a series of price increases for food and household products.
The percentage of households who expect prices to rise one year from now stood at 67.0 percent in March, up from a four-year low of 64.7 percent in December, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on people's livelihoods showed on Friday.
The last time the survey showed a growing number of households anticipating price hikes a year hence was in June 2015. 
In the latest survey, 79.3 percent expected inflation to pick up five years from now, compared with 77.6 percent in December.
Japan's core consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in February from a year earlier. It was the second straight month of rises after a year of declines, but the figure remained far below the BOJ's target of 2 percent.
Still, shoppers are beginning to see higher prices on supermarket shelves, for items from butter to dry seaweed, as a weaker yen makes imported materials more expensive and labor shortages hike logistics costs.
Cooking oil firm Nisshin Ollio Group (T:2602) raised prices this month and tissue paper firm Oji Nepia is planning increases from May.
While prices have risen, incomes have been largely unchanged since October after adjustment for inflation, despite the government's call for Japan Inc to accelerate wage increases to support economic recovery. Real wages were flat in February, a separate labor ministry survey showed on Friday.

The BOJ's latest survey was conducted between Feb. 8 and March 6 with responses from 2,174 people.

Tourism bodies have warned that travel to the United States could slow this year due to a perception that it is less welcoming to travelers than before.
""Although we remain concerned over the impact of any travel restrictions or closing of borders, we have not seen the attempted U.S. ban on travel from six countries translate into an identifiable traffic trend,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement on Thursday.
Middle Eastern carriers, among the most affected by the attempted travel restrictions, saw demand rise 9.5 percent in February, said IATA, which represents nearly 265 airlines accounting for 83 percent of global air traffic. 
De Juniac also repeated criticism of the way in which authorities brought in new restrictions on electronic devices larger than a smartphone from passenger cabins on flights from certain countries without first consulting the airline industry. 
""The introduction of restrictions on the carry-on of large electronic devices was a missed opportunity and the result was a measure that cannot stand-up to the scrutiny of public confidence in the long term,"" he said.

Overall, capacity in February increased 2.7 percent, leading to the load factor - a measure of how full planes are - rising 1.6 percentage points to 79.5 percent. IATA said that was the highest-ever level recorded for a February.
Falling fares have put pressure on airline earnings in recent months and IATA said it estimates fares have dropped by more than 10 percent in real terms over the last year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders picked up in February after plummeting the previous month and the Economy Ministry said an upturn in the sector was on the cards, although a rise in contracts for Germany's factories was weaker than expected.
Contracts rose 3.4 percent on the month, data from the Economy Ministry showed on Thursday. That missed the Reuters consensus forecast for a 4.0 percent increase but came after an upwardly revised drop of 6.8 percent in January.
The data comes after a survey that showed manufacturing growth reached its highest level in almost six years in March, driven by an increase in orders for intermediate goods, suggesting the sector will contribute to an economic expansion in the first quarter.
""The increase in orders was important - otherwise concerns about production would definitely have been warranted,"" said Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe.
""After all the zig-zagging around the turn of the year, the development of orders seems to have found its way again, but we still have the impression that sentiment indicators have sprinted too far ahead of the real trend,"" he said.
February's increase was driven by the strongest surge in domestic demand since May 2011, with companies in Germany ordering 8.1 percent more goods than they ordered in January, when they had significantly scaled back orders.
But foreign orders failed to contribute, with a breakdown showing bookings from the euro zone fell by 2.4 percent while non-euro zone contracts increased by 1.6 percent.
A breakdown of the February data showed demand for intermediate goods soared while appetite for consumer products rose and contracts for capital goods edged up.
The Economy Ministry said that in the less-volatile two-month comparison for January/February compared with November/December, orders declined by 2.4 percent, with domestic and foreign orders equally to blame. But it said it expected the industrial sector's performance to improve slightly.
Other recent data has shown unemployment falling, retail sales rising and growth in services accelerating, though engineering orders were flat in February as domestic orders dropped.

Forward-looking data has given reason for optimism too, with business morale hitting its highest level in nearly six years and investor morale improving despite the numerous risks that Germany's economy faces this year - unpredictable elections at home and in France, protectionist trade policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, and Britain's Brexit negotiations.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for March fell to 52.2 from February's 52.6, but remained above the 50-level that separates expansion from contraction.
The survey of largely medium- and small-sized firms showed activity at its lowest since September 2016.
The result contrasted with official surveys showing services PMI growth for March accelerating at the fastest pace in almost three years, and manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanding at the quickest rate in nearly 5 years last month.
In Thursday's private services survey subdued business demand pulled down the headline PMI index. There are concerns China's real estate sector - a big growth-driver for sectors from construction to banking - could become a drag on the broader economy as they were hit with fresh waves of housing policy curbs in mid-March.
The new business sub-component slipped 1.1 percentage points to 52.2 in March, the weakest demand for China's service providers since September 2016.
""Weaker increases in new business have clouded the economic outlook, and investors should watch closely for signs of a turning point in the second quarter,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group said in a note.
Lukewarm growth may also suggest consumers in the world's second-largest economy are cutting back on spending, highlighted by disappointing revenue reports at some of the nation's top consumer firms.
Retail sales growth was well below expectations in the first two months of the year as auto sales dipped.
Cost pressures also rose sharply as input prices soared to their highest point in more than four years, although firms were able to pass on part of the costs to customers with a modest increase in prices charged.
A number of companies linked rising cost to higher salary payments, the survey said.
While the overall readings in the private survey were far from alarming, the underlying results backed analysts' cautious view on the outlook for the economy.
In particular, economists believe the construction rally, largely driven by a furious property boom since last year, may have peaked. Indeed, official data on Friday showed new construction orders dropped to the lowest since August 2016.
On top of the stepped-up curbs on the property sector, Beijing has also started to tighten policy settings to temper risks from a rapid build-up in debt.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Thursday, reinforced the patchy growth underpinned by weaker demand in March, with the index falling to 52.1 from the previous month's 52.6.
""The Chinese economy continued to expand in March, but growth in both manufacturing and services slowed,"" CEBM Group's Zhong said, referring to the private survey.
Both the Caixin services and composite readings showed service providers and manufacturers continued to add jobs last month, but the pace was moderating.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 05:06PM ET</span>",Most Fed policymakers see change to balance sheet policy 'later this year': minutes,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most Federal Reserve policymakers think the central bank should take steps to begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year as long as the economic data holds up, minutes from their last meeting showed.
The minutes released on Wednesday of the March 14-15 policy discussion, at which the Fed voted 9-1 to raise interest rates, also showed that the rate-setting committee had a broad discussion about whether to phase out or halt reinvestments all at once.
""Provided that the economy continued to perform about as expected, most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the Committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
Treasury yields initially rose sharply after the release of the minutes but reversed course. The dollar briefly slipped while stocks on Wall Street fell.
The Fed bought Treasury and mortgage-backed bonds on an unprecedented scale in the wake of the financial crisis to help keep interest rates low to spur hiring and growth.
Fed policymakers have previously indicated that any plan to shrink its portfolio would let the bonds naturally roll off, by not reinvesting them when they mature, once its interest rate hikes were ""well under way.""
""The December FOMC meeting is probably the most likely date to introduce this change,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, following the publication of the minutes.
The Fed's lifted its benchmark interest rate in March to a target range of between 0.75 and 1 percent, its second hike in three months, and signaled it remained on track to lift rates twice more this year.
In the minutes, almost all policymakers agreed that the timing of a change in balance sheet policy would depend on economic and financial conditions and generally preferred to taper or stop investments in both Treasury and mortgage-backed bonds.
An approach that phased out reinvestments was seen as less likely to trigger financial market volatility while doing so all at once ""was generally viewed as easier to communicate while allowing for somewhat swifter normalization of the size of the balance sheet.""
What they all agreed on was that shrinking the balance sheet should be gradual and predictable and nearly all said that any altering of the policy ""should be communicated...well in advance of an actual change.""
UPSIDE RISKS TO ECONOMY
New York Fed President William Dudley recently said that taking steps to normalize the balance sheet would tighten financial conditions and could affect the pace of rate rises.
Prior to the minutes Wall Street banks expected no changes to the balance sheet policy until mid-2018, the latest poll by the New York Fed showed.
Elsewhere in the minutes policymakers appeared to see upside risks to the economy while there was still disagreement on how close the Fed was to meeting its 2 percent inflation goal this year.
In its March policy statement, the Fed said that its inflation target was ""symmetric,"" indicating it could tolerate price rises temporarily overshooting its 2 percent target rate.
Along with the minutes, the central bank for the first time also published a set of so-called ""fan charts"" to show the extent of uncertainty around their quarterly economic forecasts.
Uncertainty around them was substantial, the Fed said.
The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for May 2-3 while investors currently expect another rate rise in June.

1379,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 02:15PM ET</span>",Fed minutes: Balance sheet reduction later this year,"Investing.com – Several Federal Reserve officials agreed that gradual rate hikes are likely appropriate this year, and favoured a plan to begin reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet ‘later this year’, according to the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday.
“Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,” according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday in Washington.
Consensus among Federal Reserve officials concerning the impact of President Trump's fiscal stimulus package on growth appeared to be mixed, as some Fed officials didn’t factor in the impact of fiscal stimulus on their growth projections while others believed that the impact of fiscal stimulus on economic growth would only come into effect in 2018.
During the March meeting, Federal Reserve officials warned that upcoming elections in the European Union (EU) countries posed both near-term and longer-term risks.
The US Dollar Index Futures, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 101.67, up 0.24%. The dollar leaped to a session high of 100.91, following the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting.
Elsewhere, U.S. equities moved higher, with all three major U.S. indexes in positive territory:
The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 0.75% higher at 20,844. The S&P 500 gained 0.68% and the Nasdaq Composite traded higher at 5,931.
Gold Futures dipped slightly to trade down 0.77% at $1,248.00 while Treasury yields inched higher with the U.S. 10-Year trading at around 2.375, up 1.06% by 14:23 EDT."
1380,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 11:40AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage activity falls to five-week low: MBA,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage application activity hit a five-week low even as home borrowing costs were little changed from the prior week, Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday showed.
The Washington-based industry group said its measure on mortgage applications declined for a third consecutive week. It fell 1.6 percent to 397.1 in the week ended March 31.
The average interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, was 4.34 percent, little changed from 4.33 percent from the prior week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less and that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Rates on conforming 30-year loans were steady despite another weekly decline in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) due to doubts on possible tax cuts and infrastructure spending and hints from Federal Reserve officials that the U.S. central bank is sticking to its gradual pace on rate increases.
Mortgage rates on some fixed-rate home loans that the MBA tracks were mixed last week.
The group's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan fell 4.2 percent to 1,271.9, the lowest level in six weeks.
The share of refinancing applications shrank to 42.6 percent form 44.0 percent the preceding week, MBA said.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of purchase application activity, a proxy for future home sales, edged up 0.7 percent to 239.8.
The share of applications for adjustable-rate mortgages was unchanged from the previous week at 8.5 percent.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 55.2 from 57.6 in February which was the highest since October 2015.
The March reading was below expectations of 57.0 from a Reuters poll of 64 economists.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.

Strong job gains in the coming months will likely add upward pressure on wages, supporting the Federal Reserve's view for at least two more interest rate increases by the end of 2017.
""The labor market is tight and it will get tighter,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics which jointly developed the ADP National Employment Report.
ADP's March figure easily beat the median forecast of 187,000 increase among economists surveyed by Reuters. 
Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 245,000 from the originally reported 298,000.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 175,000 jobs in March, down from 227,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have risen by 180,000.
The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at the 4.7 percent recorded a month earlier.
Wage growth has been running at a 2.5-3.0 percent year-over-year pace, which is modest by historical standards, Zandi said.
One factor that may lead to faster wage gains is the uncertainty on immigration policy. Stricter immigration as proposed by the Trump administration would reduce labor supply, forcing employers to compete for workers.
""The labor shortage might be exacerbated by immigration issues,"" Zandi said.

If immigration were cut in half, that could choke off domestic labor growth which is currently running at 3-4 percent a year, according to Zandi.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>",UK economy probably slowing after strong end to 2016: PMI,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy has probably slowed from its strong growth of late last year and a cooling jobs market and hefty price increases will become increasingly apparent as Brexit gets underway, according to a survey published on Wednesday.
The Markit/CIPS Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a closely watched gauge of Britain's services industry, rose to a three-month high of 55.0 in March from 53.3 in February.
That topped all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, whose median forecast was for a reading of 53.5, pushing sterling almost half a cent higher against the dollar. [GBP/]
But there were some warning signals as Britain begins the two-year process of leaving the European Union.
Services companies raised their selling prices at the fastest pace since 2008, a sign that inflation may rise more than the 3 percent expected by many forecasters this year. Businesses hired people at the slowest pace in seven months.
Taken together, the PMIs for manufacturing, construction and services published this week suggest economic growth will slow to around 0.4 percent in the first quarter from 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, data firm IHS Markit said.
Growth of 0.4 percent would be in line with the most recent Reuters poll of economists but slower than the 0.6 percent predicted by the Bank of England.
""The PMI does not cover the retail sector, and hence may be overestimating growth somewhat given the concentrated hit in that area,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Allan Monks said.
But conditions outside Britain had clearly improved and there was uncertainty about how quickly consumers will respond to higher prices, he said in a note to clients.
The BoE is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low throughout this year and possibly until 2019 as it steers the British economy through the uncertainty linked to the exit from the EU.
However, one rate-setter voted last month for a rate increase and others said they might follow suit soon if there were signs that economy was maintaining its momentum of 2016.
Despite the stronger-than-expected headline growth figure in Wednesday's PMI, the survey also suggested consumers were cutting back on luxuries. Hotels and restaurants, gyms and hairdressers ranked among the worst-performing services in the first three months of 2017.
""Much of the disappointment in growth so far this year has been evident in consumer-oriented sectors, in part linked to spending and incomes being squeezed by higher prices,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Official data on Wednesday showed modest improvement for one of Britain's most persistent economic headaches, weak productivity.
Output-per-hour grew at the fastest pace in more than a year in the final three months of 2016, but remained well below the average rate seen before the financial crisis.
The figures did little to challenge expectations that 2017 will be a tough one for many Britons.
Nearly half of British households plan to cut spending as worries about inflation escalate, according to a separate survey on Wednesday from pension provider Scottish Friendly and the think tank Social Market Foundation.
Official data last week showed real household disposable income - a measure of spending power in the fourth quarter of 2016 - saw its biggest quarter-on-quarter decline in nearly three years.
Industry figures for new car registrations bucked other signs of weakening consumer demand, with sales rising 8.4 percent last month. But the surge in part reflected customers bringing forward purchases to beat a tax rise, which may bode for a weak April, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.

The all-sector PMI, covering manufacturing, construction and services, rose a full point to 54.7 in March.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 06:01AM ET</span>",Euro zone business activity at six-year high in broad recovery,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses enjoyed their best quarter in six years at the start of 2017 and although growth was not quite as fast as a flash estimate, the upturn was broad-based, a survey suggested on Wednesday.
Soaring demand allowed firms to raise prices at the fastest rate since mid-2011 and survey compiler HIS Markit said the data pointed to first-quarter economic growth of 0.6 percent, faster than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month. 
The final Markit Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, regarded as a good guide to growth, rose to a near-six year high of 56.4 in March from February's 56.0. The flash reading, at 56.7, had suggested a sharper rise.
""This is quite a positive start to the year and pointing to accelerated growth in the region as a whole,"" said Oliver Kolodseike at CEBR. 
Earlier surveys from Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies, showed growth accelerated last month and while the rates of expansion slowed in Italy and Spain they remained robust.
Output prices rose at their fastest rate in nearly six years. The sub-index jumped to 53.1 from 52.2, lower than the flash 53.3 reading but still probably welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has been trying to stimulate inflation for years.
Inflation in the 19-member currency union plunged to 1.5 percent in March, official data showed on Friday, apparently vindicating ECB President Mario Draghi's cautious policy stance and proving the bloc may be years away from a sustained rise in consumer prices. The ECB would like inflation just below 2 percent.
ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Monday the Bank's monetary policy stance remained appropriate.
""We don't expect the ECB to act yet, they will keep their policy stance as a 'wait-and-see' approach. The PMI numbers are just one indicator -- you have to wait for more official data,"" Kolodseike said.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant services industry came in below a flash estimate of 56.5, registering 56.0. Still, that was above the 55.5 February final number and was the highest since May 2011.
On Monday, a sister survey showed manufacturers in the bloc struggled to keep up with demand last month, despite increasing activity at the fastest rate in nearly six years. 
To meet growing demand -- which accelerated at the fastest rate in almost six years in March -- services firms ramped up hiring. The employment index was 54.4, up from 53.6 and marking the fastest rate since the end of 2007.

""Most welcome for a region still suffering near-double digit unemployment is a rise in the survey's employment index,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at HIS Markit.

1394,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 04:33AM ET</span>", U.K. services activity logs strongest increase so far in 2017,"Investing.com – Activity in the U.K. service sector logged its strongest rise in 2017, bolstering optimism over the British economy as the sector makes up approximately 80% of gross domestic product, industry data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, market research group Markit said its seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.0 last month from a reading of 53.3 in February.
Analysts had expected the index to inch up to 53.5.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that new work increased at a strong pace although job creation slowed.
Furthermore, the research firm highlighted that the strongest prices since September 2008 charged inflation.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented that the relative weakness of the survey data when compared to the turn of the year suggest that growth in the first quarter will be 0.4% in the first quarter, “markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year”.
Williamson said that the uptick in March PMI surveys coincided with a neutral policy stance at the Bank of England.
“As such, the data add to the sense that, with economic and political uncertainty likely to intensify as the Brexit process gets underway, policymakers are likely to continue to stress the need to look through any further upturn in inflation and focus instead on the need to keep policy on hold to support economic growth,” this expert concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2473 from around 1.2437 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8560 from 0.8580 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 138.07 compared to 137.67 previously.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded with mixed signs as London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.14%. The Euro Stoxx 50 slipped 0.06%, France's CAC 40 edged down 0.04%, while Germany's DAX lost 0.32%."
1395,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>","German services growth strengthens in March, PMI shows","BERLIN, April 5 - Growth in Germany's services sector accelerated further in March, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting Europe's largest economy will post healthy growth in the first quarter.
Markit's final services index rose to a 15-month high of 55.6 from 54.4 in February, helped by new business in the post and telecommunication sector and the renting, business activities and financial intermediation branch.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 57.1 from 56.1 in February to reach a 70-month high.
Markit's final PMI for manufacturing on Monday showed growth had accelerated at the strongest rate in nearly six years in March. It suggested manufacturing would contribute to overall growth in the first quarter.
Wednesday's results similarly suggest services, which are not historically a German strength, would also contribute to growth.
Services providers recorded the strongest expansion in new work since February 2016. It was the second straight monthly acceleration after three months of slowing growth.
""The final services PMI data for March completed a picture of strengthening economic growth in Germany in the opening quarter of 2017,"" Markit economist Trevor Balchin said.
He added that the data reinforced Markit's full-year growth forecast of 1.9 percent this year for Europe's largest economy.
Services companies faced higher input costs linked to salaries and fuel prices. Input inflation rose for the sixth time in seven months, reaching a five-year high, which led to the biggest increases in the price of services since July 2008.
Despite inflation pressures, service providers were most optimistic about their 12-month business outlook in six years.
Their optimism was reflected in increased hiring. Job creation rose at the fastest rate since November 2010 and for
the 41st month in a row.
However, the hiring drive was not enough to offset pressure on capacity - outstanding business rose for the second consecutive month at the highest rate since June 2016.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.9 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis from 51.3 in February.
The index remained above the 50 threshold, which separates expansion from contraction, for the sixth consecutive month.
""The underlying performance of the Japanese economy continues to strengthen, with the PMI data suggestive of accelerated GDP growth during the first quarter of the year,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The index for outstanding business rose to 51.6 in March from 50.2 in the previous month to show the fastest growth in 20 months.
The business expectations index rose to 55.4 from 53.8 in February to mark the fastest growth since April last year.
Services account for around two-thirds of Japan's gross domestic product, so expansion in that sector could help overall economic growth.
While the country is seeing a modest economic recovery, the improvement has been highly dependent on a rebound in exports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell from a near two year high in February as slowing domestic demand weighed on imports and stronger global growth boosted exports of American goods.
The politically sensitive trade gap with China narrowed sharply by 26.6 percent from January to $23 billion ahead of a summit between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping this week, although seasonal factors were likely behind the dramatic drop, economists said.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade deficit declined 9.6 percent to $43.6 billion, also as exports increased to their highest level in more than two years, after rising to a near two-year high of $48.2 billion in January.
""The U.S has its work cut out for it if it is going to try to alter the pattern of trade that has developed between China and U.S. companies over the last 10 to 20 years,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Economists had forecast the overall trade gap falling to $44.8 billion in February. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit decreased to $59.7 billion, with exports of goods the highest on record as an earlier drag from a strong dollar fades. 
The real trade deficit was $65.1 billion in January. 
Despite the decline in the real trade deficit, trade will probably be either neutral or impose a small drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter after subtracting 1.82 percentage points from fourth-quarter growth.
In addition to trade, weak consumer spending also likely constrained the economy in the first three months of the year.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, a deceleration from the 2.1 percent pace logged in the October-December period.
The dollar were little changed against a basket of currencies, as were stocks on Wall Street. Treasuries were trading lower.
ELIMINATING THE TRADE IMBALANCE
Trump's administration has ordered a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clamp-down on import duty evasion. He believes that large deficits are slowing American growth and employment.
Trump also wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
A second report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods increased for a third straight month in February on growing demand for machinery and electrical equipment, suggesting the manufacturing-led recovery was broadening.
""The strength in manufacturing activity and overall job creation will result in the Federal Reserve looking through what looks likely to be a soft quarterly reading on real GDP growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.In February, imports of goods and services fell 1.8 percent to $236.4 billion amid declines in imports of cell phones and motor vehicles. Imports had risen in recent months, in part on higher oil prices.
Some of the decline in imports in February likely reflects slower consumer spending. Data on Friday showed real consumer spending decreased for a second straight month in February, the first back-to-back monthly decline since April 2009.
Still, food imports hit a record high in February and imports of capital goods were the highest in nearly two years. 
Exports of goods and services increased 0.2 percent to $192.9 billion, the highest level since December 2014 as shipments of automobiles and parts hit their highest level since July 2014. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since December 2015. 

The nation exported more goods to Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Italy. However, exports to China fell 2.7 percent and Mexico saw a 7.1 percent drop in goods sourced from the United States.

growing demand for machinery and electrical equipment, suggesting the manufacturing sector recovery was gaining steam.
Factory goods orders rose 1.0 percent, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday after an upwardly revised 1.5 percent increase in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 1.0 percent in February after a previously reported 1.2 percent increase in January.
Factory orders were up 4.6 percent from a year ago.
Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in January. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is recovering in part as steadily rising oil prices reinvigorate the energy sector, leading to demand for machinery and other equipment.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans -- dipped 0.1 percent as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, jumped 1.0 percent, also as reported last month.
The rise in shipments suggests an acceleration in business spending on equipment in the first quarter after it increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in final three months of 2016.
That was the first rise in a year.
In February, orders for machinery rose 0.3 percent. Orders for transportation equipment advanced 4.4 percent, reflecting a 47.5 percent surge in civilian aircraft orders as well as a 0.3 percent rise in motor vehicle orders.
Orders for computers and electronic products gained 0.1 percent and bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components jumped 1.9 percent.
Unfilled orders at factories were unchanged after falling for three straight months. Inventories of goods at factories rose 0.2 percent in February. They have increased in seven of the last eight months. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was 1.31 in February, unchanged from January.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index dropped to a seasonally adjusted 52.2 last month from February’s reading of 54.5.
Economists had expected the index to slip to 52.4 in March.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report indicated that the housing slowdown offset the rebound in civil engineering and commercial work, while input price inflation also slowed further from January’s peak.
“U.K. construction firms experienced a growth slowdown in March, with the loss of momentum centered on housebuilding,” Markit senior economist Tim Moore commented in the report.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2017-07
Date 4 April 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy have improved over recent months. Both global trade and industrial production have picked up. Labour markets have tightened in many countries. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth is being supported by higher spending on infrastructure and property construction. This composition of growth and the rapid increase in borrowing mean that the medium-term risks to Chinese growth remain. The improvement in the global economy has contributed to higher commodity prices, which are providing a significant boost to Australia’s national income.
Headline inflation rates have moved higher in most countries, partly reflecting the higher commodity prices. Core inflation remains low. Long-term bond yields are higher than last year, although in a historical context they remain low. Interest rates have increased in the United States and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively.
The Australian economy is continuing its transition following the end of the mining investment boom. Recent data are consistent with ongoing moderate growth. Most measures of business confidence are at, or above, average and non-mining business investment has risen over the past year. At the same time, some indicators of conditions in the labour market have softened recently. In particular, the unemployment rate has moved a little higher and employment growth is modest. The various forward-looking indicators still point to continued growth in employment over the period ahead. Wage growth remains slow.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. Lenders have recently announced increases in mortgage rates, particularly those paid by investors. Financial institutions remain in a good position to lend. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Inflation remains quite low. Headline inflation is expected to pick up over the course of 2017 to be above 2 per cent. The rise in underlying inflation is expected to be a bit more gradual with growth in labour costs remaining subdued.
Conditions in the housing market continue to vary considerably around the country. In some markets, conditions are strong and prices are rising briskly. In other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Growth in rents is the slowest for two decades.
Growth in household borrowing, largely to purchase housing, continues to outpace growth in household income. By reinforcing strong lending standards, the recently announced supervisory measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness. Lenders need to ensure that the serviceability metrics that they use are appropriate for current conditions. A reduced reliance on interest-only housing loans in the Australian market would also be a positive development.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

""... We remain cautious but do not want to overstate the problems in the retail industry,"" said Barbara Denham, senior economist at Reis.
Expectations have lowered for the retail real estate industry due to the rapid rise in e-commerce and store closures. However the full impact of the closures has yet to be felt, Denham said.
Construction activity fell by more than two-thirds in the quarter, with a paltry 796,000 square feet of new construction completed.
Asking rent inched up 0.3 percent, while effective rent rose 0.4 percent, Reis said.
Net absorption, which is measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, more than halved to 1.25 million square feet.
The national vacancy rate for neighborhood and community shopping centers was flat at 9.9 percent.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Major U.S. automakers' sales figures for March came in below market expectations and gave early evidence that America's long, robust boom cycle for car sales may finally be losing steam.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) shares both fell almost 4 percent, while  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) was off 3 percent.
Auto industry publication WardsAuto put the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle sales in March at 16.53 million units. Industry consultant Autodata put industry SAAR at 16.62 million units for March.
That was below the 17.3 million analysts polled by Reuters had expected, and the first time since August that the SAAR - a crucial industry metric - had fallen below 17 million. 
March ""was a tough, tough, tough market,"" said Judy Wheeler, vice president of U.S. sales at Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), which reported a 3.2 percent increase in March sales. ""It's going to be an aggressive year and I think everybody realizes that.""
Industry experts are increasingly concerned about rising inventory levels and consumer discounts as automakers push harder to sell their products. A pricing war in the market could undermine automakers' profits.
Last week, Moody's warned that flattening U.S. auto sales pose a significant credit risk for auto lenders.
Karl Brauer, executive publisher at auto industry consultancy Kelley Blue Book said while overall sales looked ""healthy"" in March discounts ""have risen across the board, even on the same truck and SUV models that used to sell themselves."" 
Nissan's Wheeler said Nissan's internal data showed consumer discounts were $441 higher per vehicle than a year ago and inventory levels were on the rise.
Nissan trucks, SUVs and crossovers were up 26 percent and had hit record highs, especially its high-selling Rogue crossover.
Car sales in America have risen since end of the Great Recession and hit a record last year of 17.55 million. 
Trucks and SUVs pushed sales at some major automakers higher in March at the expense of cars as American consumers continued to shun smaller vehicles amid low gasoline prices. 
GM reported a 2 percent increase in sales to just over 256,000 vehicles, with sales of its Tahoe and Suburban SUV models seeing their best sales month since 2008.
Sales at Ford Motor Co (N:F) fell more than 7 percent to 236,000 vehicles, with fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities down nearly 17 percent on the year. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks rose 10 percent on the year.
The F-Series has been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982 and is a key profit generator for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported a 2.1 percent decrease in sales. Fiat Chrysler said sales were down 5 percent on the year, though its popular Ram pickup was up 6 percent.
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) reported an overall decline in sales of 0.7 percent versus March 2016, but said truck sales were up 8.4 percent.
GM shares were down 3.8 percent at $34.03 and Ford was off 3 percent at $11.29. Fiat Chrysler shares (N:FCAU) were down 5.9 percent in New York trading at $10.28.
The news also weighed on car retailer stocks. The March sales offered the market a glimpse of the overall health of middle-class American consumers.
Car retailer Penske Auto Group (N:PAG) was down 1.5 percent and Group 1 Automotive (N:GPI) was down 3.3 percent on Monday morning.

Exports totaled $20.1 billion and imports $12.9 billion. Economists in a Reuters poll predicted a surplus of $6.8 billion, according to their median forecast.
The meat scandal, which saw China and Hong Kong impose import bans, appeared to have less of an impact on export numbers than some had anticipated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity retreated from a 2-1/2-year high in March amid a decline in production and an inventory drawdown, but a surge in factory jobs indicated that the sector's energy-led recovery was gaining momentum.
Other data on Monday showed construction spending rising to a near 11-year high in February, lifted by a jump in home building investment. The reports pointed to strong fundamentals despite signs of weak economic growth in the first quarter.
""The U.S. economic expansion remains on solid footing even taking into a account what is likely to be a pretty lackluster first-quarter growth profile,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S.
economist at RBC Markets in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.2 last month from 57.7 in February, which was the highest since August 2014.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Seventeen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth and no industry reported a contraction. Comments from factories were mostly upbeat, with machinery manufacturers saying that business was up 10 percent to 15 percent. 
Transport equipment manufacturers, however, described the industry's outlook as ""relatively flat."" The manufacturing recovery is being driven by the energy sector as steady increases in crude oil prices boost drilling activity.
A report from energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday showed U.S. drillers added 137 rigs in the first quarter, the most since the second quarter of 2011. That has fueled demand for machinery, resulting in business spending on equipment rising in the fourth quarter for the first time in a year.
Manufacturing is also benefiting from a surge in business sentiment following President Donald Trump's pledge to pursue business-friendly policies, including cutting corporate taxes and deregulation.
But after last month's failed attempt by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to repeal the Obama administration's 2010 healthcare law, economists warn that Trump might struggle to implement his agenda.
The dollar rose to a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell after New York and other states challenged the Trump administration on grounds of illegally blocking energy efficiency standards. U.S. Treasuries rose.
HIRING PROSPECTS BRIGHTEN 
Last month, the ISM survey's production sub-index decreased 5.3 percentage points to 57.6. A gauge of manufacturing inventories contracted. While that weighed on the ISM index, it bodes well for future manufacturing activity.
Though a measure of new orders fell last month, it remained near a more than three-year high. A gauge of factory employment jumped to its highest reading since June 2011. That would suggest another strong month of factory job gains in March.
But sentiment indicators such as the ISM have been painting a more robust picture than the so-called hard data, which has suggested that the economy grew around a 1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
""If manufacturers hire as many workers as the survey says they are planning to do, the nonfarm payroll jobs number on Friday could be a blowout,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, further evidence that inflation pressures are building up. A report on Friday showed a key consumer inflation measure in February recorded its biggest annual gain in nearly five years.
The ISM's prices index rose 2.5 percentage points in February to 70.5, the highest reading since May 2011, indicating higher raw materials prices for the 13th straight month.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending increased 0.8 percent to $1.19 trillion in February, the highest level since April 2006, after dropping 0.4 percent in January. 
Construction spending was boosted by outlays on private residential construction, which surged 1.8 percent to the highest level since July 2007. Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 0.3 percent.

""The trend in nonresidential construction spending has softened lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Despite this weakening in the data, we still look for a strong increase in overall private nonresidential investment in the first quarter because of large gains in separate data related to activity in the energy sector.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Crisis-stricken Venezuela's money supply has surged over 200 percent in a year, its fastest rise since records began in 1940, putting it on track for what is likely the world's highest inflation. 
Soon after a month-long hiatus from publication, the central bank said late on Friday the total amount of local currency in circulation - known as M2 by economists - as of March 24 was 13.3 trillion bolivars, up 202.9 percent from a year earlier.
In contrast, the United States' money supply was up 6.4 percent in the same period.
Venezuela is in a major economic crisis, with millions struggling with food shortages and inflation thought to be in triple digits - though no official data is available.
The exponential rise in M2, the sum of cash, together with checking, savings and other deposits, means an exponential rise in the amount of currency circulating.
Coupled with a decline in the output of goods and services, that has accelerated inflation.
The central bank website shows five separate spreadsheets with money supply data going back to 1940. Back then, as now, Venezuela's primary export was oil.
While M2 may seem an obscure technical indicator, the figure was routinely published by newspapers in Venezuela, whose oil-dependent economy has been dogged by inflation in the past.
Venezuela's opposition-led National Assembly, which accuses the leftist government of destroying the OPEC country's economy, says inflation reached 741 percent in the year to February.
President Nicolas Maduro says right-wing businessmen are hoarding goods to sabotage his administration, an accusation the opposition rejects. 

The last year for which official inflation data is available from the central bank is 2015, when consumer prices rose 181 percent.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factories across Europe and much of Asia posted another month of solid growth in March, rounding off a strong quarter for manufacturers, even though exporters fear a rise in U.S. protectionism could snuff out a global trade recovery.
China led the way, with an official manufacturing index expanding at the fastest pace in nearly five years. Surveys on Monday also showed encouraging growth in Europe, Japan, India and much of emerging Asia.
In the euro zone, IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to its highly in nearly six-year high of 56.2 in March, far above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
However, British manufacturers lost some momentum last month, as export orders grew more slowly and rising inflation cut into consumer demand.
Sterling's tumble following June's vote to leave the European Union helped manufacturers enjoy their fastest annual growth in three years during the final quarter of 2016 but the sector's PMI suggested growth slowed in the first three months of this year.
""Greater optimism about global growth prospects appears to be providing a boost, while the fall in the value of the pound post-Brexit is helping new orders,"" James Smith at ING said of the British PMI.
""Whilst the near-term outlook for manufacturing looks encouraging, it's possible that Brexit uncertainty will start to weigh more heavily on sentiment over coming months.""
TRUMP TRADE
The official Chinese PMI on Friday rose to 51.8 in March from 51.6, thanks to a months-long construction boom which is helping to boost resources prices around the world.
That was the strongest reading since April 2012, though a private survey focusing on smaller companies suggested a more cautious outlook, raising questions about whether the export recovery can be sustained.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said the strength in China won't last - measures to cool its overheated property market and tighter central bank policy is likely to curb investment and industrial activity in coming quarters.
But the biggest risk for China may be brewing halfway across the world. U.S. President Donald Trump is due to hold his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Florida later this week and those talks may be tense.
On Friday, Trump sought to push his crusade against U.S. trade deficits and for more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda, by ordering a study into the causes of the trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion.
The failure of the new U.S. administration to push through healthcare reforms last month has also added to global worries Trump will struggle to pass the tax cuts and spending plans he promised, which could boost demand in the world's largest economy.
Delays to the re-flationary plans could see U.S. orders and global investment slow in coming months as businesses grow more cautious.
China has strong domestic demand to fall back on, at least for now, but other export-reliant Asian economies are more vulnerable if Trump goes on a trade offensive.
Japanese factory activity expanded at a solid clip in March, though the pace slowed from the previous month as growth in new export orders and output slowed.
In South Korea, where exports account for half of the economy and domestic demand is similarly weak, readings have been decidedly mixed.
On a more upbeat note, India's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in five months as output and new orders accelerated.
The findings suggested the world's fastest-growing major economy has largely recovered from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision in November to ban high-value currency notes, which caused huge disruptions to the largely cash-based economy. 

""Asia's economic backdrop remains solid with most countries remaining above the key threshold level of expansion, though U.S. trade protectionism fears is the biggest uncertainty for now,"" said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",U.S. small business borrowing up in February,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms in February rose from a month prior, but was down from the year earlier as business owners remained cautious about investing amid policy uncertainty, data released on Monday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index for February registered 132.9, unadjusted for seasonal trends, up from 124.2 but down 4 percent from last February.
Movements in the index typically correspond with changes in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead.
Bets that U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tax cuts will boost corporate profits have lifted U.S. equities since his November election.
But prospects for other Trump policies, including a bid to change national health insurance laws that failed earlier this month, have increased uncertainty.
""The private companies are still looking for the right time and the right conditions to put their money to work again,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder. ""They don't have the confidence to go all in.""
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Meanwhile, the number of companies falling behind on paying back existing debts has stayed low, PayNet data also showed. The share of loans more than 30 days past due was 1.67 percent in February, unchanged from January.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 54.2 last month from a reading of 54.6 in March.
Analysts had expected the PMI to increase to 55.1.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Despite the miss due to the slowdown in output and new order growth, Markit indicated that the PMI remained above long-term trends.
However, the research group also noted price pressures remained elevated.
“The survey data suggest that the goods-producing sector made a solid contribution to GDP during the opening quarter of 2017,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“However, it’s clear that the expansion will be less than the buoyant 1.3% rise seen in the fourth quarter of last year,” he added.
Immediately after the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2511 from around 1.2532 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8527 compared to 0.8512 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 139.32 compared to 139.63 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading with mixed signs. London’s FTSE 100 inched up 0.05%, the Euro Stoxx 50 edged forward 0.05%, France's CAC 40 lost 0.14%, though Germany's DAX gained 0.23%."

LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Factories across the euro zone struggled to keep up with demand last month despite increasing activity at the fastest rate in nearly six years, according to a survey that showed them again hiking prices.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 56.2 in March, the highest since April 2011, from February's 55.4. It was in line with a flash estimate and far above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday, rose to a near six-year high of 57.5 from 57.3. The flash estimate was 57.2.
""Euro zone manufacturing is clearly enjoying a sweet spell as we move into spring, but it is also suffering growing pains in the form of supply delays and rising costs,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The survey is also signaling the highest incidence of supplier delivery delays for nearly six years, underscoring how suppliers are struggling to meet surging demand.""
A sub-index measuring delivery times fell to 41.9 from 43.9, its lowest reading since May 2011. New orders surged despite prices charged rising faster than in any month since June 2011.
Signs of accelerating activity and price rises will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have for years failed to get inflation anywhere near their target.
Inflation slowed in March by far more than economists polled by Reuters had expected, driven down mostly by a deceleration of energy price rises, official estimates showed on Friday.
Prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.5 percent year-on-year, Eurostat estimated, down from a four-year high of 2.0 percent recorded in February. The Bank wants inflation of just under 2 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence improved for a second straight quarter to hit a one-and-a-half year high in March, a closely watched central bank survey showed, a sign the benefits of an export-driven economic recovery were broadening.
Service-sector sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters and firms remained upbeat on their capital expenditure plans, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" survey showed, offering hope the economic recovery will gather momentum in coming months.
While separate PMI data showed a slight slowdown in manufacturing activity in March, the upbeat tankan reinforces a dominant market view the central bank's next policy move would be to reduce rather than expand monetary stimulus.
""The tankan showed a balanced improvement in corporate sentiment at manufacturers and service-sector firms,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""Overall, the results support the BOJ's rosy view on the economy.""
The headline index measuring big manufacturers' business sentiment rose to plus 12 in March from plus 10 three months ago, the tankan showed on Monday, falling short of market forecasts but marking the highest reading since December 2015.
Service-sector sentiment also improved for the first time in six quarters to hit a one-year high, on brightening business prospects among retailers, hotels and restaurants.
PRICE PRESSURE RISING
Japan's economy has shown signs of life in recent months, with exports and factory output benefiting from a recovery in global demand.
Big companies expect conditions to worsen slightly in the coming three months, as risks to global trade such as Britain's decision to leave the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist statements cloud the outlook.
Automakers saw business conditions deteriorating three months ahead, underscoring concerns over how Trump's policies could affect global trade.
Still, the survey found big firms plan to increase capital spending by 0.6 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2018, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.1 percent drop.
""There has been talk about the risks of protectionism, but so far Japanese companies are not taking any specific steps related to this,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""This tankan will reinforce expectations that the BOJ is on hold for the time being. We certainly don't see the need to ease or tighten policy,"" he said.
With inflation expected to accelerate later this year, a growing number of analysts now predict the BOJ's next move would be to start scaling back its massive monetary stimulus.
While inflation remains well below the BOJ's 2 percent target, there were tentative signs a steady economic recovery could prompt companies to raise prices and wages.
The tankan indices showed more companies felt prices of goods and services were rising, in line with increases in raw material costs.
Firms surveyed in the tankan also saw the job market tightening the most since 1992, when Japan's economy was booming from an asset-inflated bubble.
Companies' capacity usages continued to rise. An index measuring production capacity, which falls when more firms report capacity shortages, slid to levels last seen in 1992, suggesting they will ramp up capital spending ahead.

BOJ officials have said they will maintain the bank's massive stimulus until sustained rises in wages and strength in private consumption keep inflation stably above 2 percent.

The Final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 52.4 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis from a final 53.3 in the previous month, and just below the flash reading for last month at 52.6.
It pointed to the slowest growth in three months even though the index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the seventh consecutive month.
Final new export orders eased to 51.9 from a preliminary 52.7 and from a final 54.3 in February.
The overall thrust of the PMI numbers suggest Japan's economy recovery remains on a modest recovery path. Data last month showed a strong surge in February exports, backing signs that an uptick in overseas demand continues to aid momentum in the trade-reliant economy.
The final reading for output was 53.0, versus the flash reading of 53.4 and below the 54.1 seen in February, although it still showed expansion for the eighth consecutive month.
Domestic demand has remained tepid for much of the past year, and the PMI showed output prices were flat from February, suggesting the Bank of Japan continues to face headwinds as it tries to get inflation to its 2 percent target.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in March, missing economist forecasts' of 51.6 and down from February's 51.7.
While the index was still well above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, the rates of growth in output, total new orders, input and output prices all slipped in March from the previous month.
Growth in export orders slowed sharply, falling to a three-month low of 51.9 from 53.8 in February.
The findings contrast with those of China's official factory survey on Friday, which showed activity grew the fastest in nearly 5 years in March. It also showed orders improved from home and abroad.
But the Caixin/Markit survey tends to focus more on small and mid-sized manufacturers, which may be benefitting less from a months-long construction boom than big industrials such as steel mills. A sub-index of the official survey had showed small companies were still struggling, though conditions were slowly improving.
The private survey is also believed to be more reflective of export-oriented firms.
CLOUDY EXPORT OUTLOOK
While China and other North Asian exporters have seen a strong rebound in shipments in recent months both in value and volume terms, the outlook is being clouded by fears of growing U.S. trade protectionism under President Donald Trump.
The Trump administration on Friday slammed China again on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and long-standing bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services.
China's manufacturing sector has been enjoying its best profits in years as a booming housing market and government infrastructure spending boosted construction.
But economists worry that fresh curbs on the heated property market and tighter credit conditions, coupled wit uncertainties about global trade, may intensify pressure on the world's second-economy later in the year.
""Overall, the Chinese manufacturing economy continued to improve, but signs of a weakening have started to emerge ahead of the second quarter. Downward pressure may further increase,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.
The survey showed manufacturers continued to shed staff, and at a slightly quicker pace than the previous month, but the employment outlook remained relatively positive as it was the second-weakest seen in just over two years.
On the brighter side, the pace of inventory reduction quickened in March with stocks of purchases and stocks of finished goods both falling into contractionary territory.
An industry survey on Friday showed that China's steel inventory by March 31 was almost 30 percent higher than the same time last year, igniting worries that steelmakers would soon face large destocking pressures.

The regional central bank's ""Nowcast"" forecast program showed first-quarter GDP on track to expand at a 2.87 percent pace, slower than the 2.96 percent rate calculated a week ago and second-quarter GDP on course to grow at 2.58 percent, compared with 2.66 percent a week earlier.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2017 11:17AM ET</span>","Consumer spending slows, but inflation is rising","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February amid delays in the payment of income tax refunds, but the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly five years supported expectations of further interest rate hikes this year.
The slowdown in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is, however, likely to be temporary with consumer confidence at a more than 16-year high and a tightening labor market pushing up wage growth.
""Given the weather-related weakness in utilities spending as well as some delays in tax refunds for low- and middle-income earners in February, we expect consumer spending to strengthen in the quarters ahead,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent. That was the smallest gain since August and followed an unrevised 0.2 percent rise in January.
Economists had expected a 0.2 percent increase. The government delayed the issuing of tax refunds this year as part of efforts to combat fraud.
Spending last month was held back by a 0.1 percent dip in purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles. While unseasonably warm weather lowered households' heating bills, it restricted spending growth last month.
Weak consumer spending resulted in the Atlanta Federal Reserve trimming its first-quarter economic growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.9 percent annualized rate. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace.
Despite signs of moderate growth, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least twice more this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month.
Other data on Friday showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipping to a reading of 96.9 in March from 97.6 earlier in the month. The final reading was a touch higher than February's 96.3. A report from the Conference Board this week showed its consumer confidence index surging in March to its highest reading since December 2000.
The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell marginally as investors skimmed profits off recent gains. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose modestly.
INFLATION PRESSURES BUILDINGEven with economic growth slowing at the start of the year, inflation is rising. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.4 percent in January.
That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase in the PCE price index to 2.1 percent, the biggest gain since April 2012. The PCE price index rose 1.9 percent in January.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the core PCE price index increased 1.8 percent after a similar gain in January.
The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. Inflation is now in the upper end of the range that Fed officials in March felt would be reached this year.
""There is nothing in this report that suggests the Fed should pause in June in its gradual renormalization of monetary policy but the Fed will look closely at the evolution of core inflation over the next two months in making that decision,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Rising price pressures are also eating into consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent in February after declining 0.2 percent in January.
That was the first back-to-back monthly decline in real consumer spending since April 2009. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.5 percent in January. Wages increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in five months.
Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Savings rose to a five-month high of $808.0 billion from $770.9 billion in January.

Rising incomes and higher savings bode well for future consumer spending.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British economy's strong finish to 2016 looks likely to prove a high watermark as Brexit gets underway, according to a range of indicators on Friday which pointed to a growing squeeze on consumers.
Households ran down their savings to a record low as their spending power shrank sharply in the last three months of 2016, official data showed.
In another indication that the world's fifth-biggest economy has lost some of its resilience to last June's shock vote to quit the European Union, the dominant services industry contracted in January for the first time since March last year.
Separately on Friday, a survey showed consumers were worried about the outlook for the economy. And there was a surprise fall in house prices.
Britain's economy last year defied forecasts that it would slow sharply after the referendum decision to leave the EU.
The Office for National Statistics confirmed gross domestic product grew by a quarterly 0.7 percent in the October-December period, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Growth for 2016 as a whole was 1.8 percent, the strongest among all Group of Seven rich nations bar Germany.
But a quick rise in inflation, caused in part by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, is expected to crimp spending by consumers, the main drivers of the economy, just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain's EU divorce. 
Real household disposable income -- a measure of spending power -- shrank by 0.4 percent in the last three months of 2016, the steepest quarter-on-quarter drop in nearly three years.   
And while consumer spending remained strong, the savings ratio sank to 3.3 percent, its lowest level since records began in 1963, raising questions about how long households can maintain their spending. 
The ONS said the fall in the savings ratio in part reflected changes in pension fund holdings rather than a big shift in the real incomes of households. But economists said the figures were reason for caution.
""For consumption to continue to grow at current levels, the UK needs the savings rate to drop further. Yet today's data show there is not much further to fall,"" HSBC economist Elizabeth Martins said in a note to clients.
COMPANIES WARY
Supermarket chain Asda said its gauge of disposable income showed the weakest growth since June 2014 during February, with the poorest households hit particularly hard.
Companies are also wary. The ONS said business investment fell by 0.9 percent in quarterly and annual terms in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with a previous estimate.
The fall the pound is not all bad news for Britain's economy and Friday's data showed it was helping to ease one of its biggest vulnerabilities -- its wide balance of payments deficit with the rest of the world.
The ONS said the current account deficit more than halved in the fourth quarter to 12.1 billion pounds -- falling by more than expected in the Reuters poll -- and stood at 2.4 percent of GDP, down sharply from 5.3 percent in the third quarter.
""Much better, but sterling still is vulnerable if overseas investors lose confidence,"" said economist Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said a ""hard Brexit"" -- big hurdles for trade between Britain and the EU -- could trigger a fire-sale of British assets by foreign investors.
The deficit had been expected to improve as the fall in the pound increased the value in sterling of British investments held abroad and helped exporters.
Net trade contributed an unusually strong 1.7 percentage points to quarterly economic growth in the fourth quarter. 

But economists said this should be seen against a 1.4 percentage point drag in the third quarter, with figures for both periods distorted by trade in ""erratic"" items like aircraft and gold.

1467,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2017 05:02AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation drops back below ECB target in March,"Investing.com – Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the euro zone decreased more than expected in March, falling back from a four-year high and easing pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to remove policy accommodation, official preliminary data showed on Thursday.
In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% in March, below expectations for an increase of 1.8% and following a final reading of a 2.0% advance in the prior month.
According to Eurostat, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in March (7.3%, compared with 9.3% in February), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (1.8%, compared with 2.5% in February), services (1.0%, compared with 1.3% in February) and non-energy industrial goods (0.2%, stable compared with February).
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in March from the same period a year ago, after a 0.9% gain in the prior month. Analysts had expected core inflation to ease to a 0.8% increase.
With the headline reading having fallen back below the ECB’s target of close to, but below, 2%, calls, particularly from Germany, for the euro area central bank to remove accommodative policy should be toned down.
The ECB will hold its next monetary policy meeting on April 27.
After the report, EUR/USD was at 1.0690 compared to 1.0694 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP traded at 0.8581 compared to 0.8592 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading lower. The Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0.45%, Germany's DAX dropped 0.15%, France’s CAC 40 lost 0.44%, while London’s FTSE 100 traded down 0.59%."

The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, showed retail sales increased by 1.8 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That beat expectations for a 0.7 percent rise and followed a downwardly revised drop of 1.0 percent in January.
On the year, shops sold 2.1 percent less in February, confounding forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase in sales.
Consumption has become a key growth driver for the German economy, which was traditionally propelled by exports, as Germans revel in record-high employment, increased job security, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs.
The data came after a GfK survey showed German consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in five months going into April, partly due to people's concerns that rising inflation will erode their purchasing power.

A breakdown of the year-on-year data showed sharp drops in sales of food, drinks and tobacco as well as clothing, shoes and other items such as books and jewelry.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2017 02:15AM ET</span>",China March factory activity grows fastest in nearly five years on building boom,"By Yawen Chen and Nicholas Heath
BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly expanded at the fastest pace in nearly 5 years in March, adding to evidence that the world's second-largest economy has gained momentum early this year as construction booms.
But while factory output accelerated and new orders from home and abroad improved, economists are increasingly questioning how long China's solid growth can be sustained.
Over a dozen cities have announced fresh measures in March to cool the overheated property market, while the export outlook is threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric. 
For now, though, China's factories appear to have shifted into higher gear, encouraged by the strongest profit growth in six years.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.8 in March from the previous month's 51.6, data showed on Friday.
That was the strongest reading since April 2012 and well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Economists had expected 51.6. 
Manufacturers also stopped shedding jobs in March for the first time in nearly five years as profitability improved. A prolonged slump in the sector and Beijing's recent campaign to cut excess capacity in ""smokestack"" industries such as steel have put millions out of work.
In an encouraging sign that China's economic growth is also becoming more balanced and broad based, activity in the services sector accelerated last month. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.1, the highest since May 2014, a separate survey showed.
The March activity readings and a raft of upbeat data for January and February point to solid growth early in 2017.
China's economy likely expanded 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, in line with the previous quarter, said Zhang Yiping, an economist at Merchants Securities. China will release the first-quarter data on April 17.
Analysts polled by Reuters in January had expected growth would start to cool this quarter, and even the government has set a less aggressive full-year growth target of 6.5 percent.
UNSUSTAINABLE GROWTH?
China's better-than-expected performance so far may be largely due to a surprise rebound in home sales and strong government infrastructure investment, which have added fresh impetus to a months-long construction boom that has lifted demand for materials from cement to steel.
Factory output accelerated in March, with the sub-index rising to 54.2 from 53.7 in February. Highlighting the strength of the building boom, a measure of the construction industry stood at a robust 60.5, compared to 60.1 in February.
Total new orders -- which cover domestic and export demand -- also showed improvement, rising to 53.3 from February's 53. 
But economists continue to have worries.
Apart from additional government curbs on property purchases, the central bank has embarked on cautious policy tightening to rein in the risks from a rapid build-up in debt.
It has raised money market and short- and medium-term interest rates on special loans several times already this year.
""Today's PMI readings suggest that China's economy continued to perform well in March, though we doubt the current strength will be sustained for much longer,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
""The correction in the property market still has much further to run which, in combination with policy tightening, will drive a slowdown in investment and industrial activity during the coming quarters.""
The construction rally may already be starting to show signs of fatigue, said Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office of investment bank NSBO, pointing to a drop in new construction orders to the lowest since August 2016. 
Inventories of iron ore at China's ports have swelled to the highest since at least 2004, by some estimates, also suggesting the risk that supply is beginning to outpace demand.
""We are concerned that this build-up in inventories in sectors such as steel is not going to be translated into end-user demand,"" Short said. 
Sharp gains in producer prices in recent months may also be losing their oomph, pointing to weaker profit growth ahead for the industrial sector.
""The rally in China’s producer prices is reaching the limit...As prices start to ease, buyers will likely halt new orders and hence overall business momentum will slow,"" analysts at ANZ said in a note.
Indeed, China's iron ore futures prices fell nearly 2 percent on Friday and looked set for a monthly drop of 13 percent on worries about surging stockpiles. [IRONORE/]
TRUMP FEARS OVERSHADOW STRONG DATA 
Asian financial markets were largely unfazed by the buoyant China data as investors' attention turned to the first meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week.
Trump foreshadowed the risk that those talks could be tense, tweeting on Thursday that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses.
The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier that Beijing must change its trade practices and the way its state enterprises operate.

Trump's recent meeting with German leader Angela Merkel ""revealed he's willing to give bad meetings. A bad meeting with President Xi would raise the prospect of a trade war, which would be a global risk-off event,"" ING's chief Asia economist Tim Condon said in a note.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business outlook likely improved for a second straight quarter in March to its strongest since mid-2015, a Reuters poll found on Friday, buoyed by a weak yen and a pickup in exports. 
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey will likely show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved by four points to plus 14 in March from plus 10 in December, the poll of 19 economists found.
It would be the highest reading since the June 2015 survey when the index of big manufacturers' mood was at plus 15.
The poll found the sentiment index for big non-manufacturers would likely rise to plus 20 from plus 18 three months ago, improving for the first time in six quarters and hitting its highest level since March 2016 when it stood at plus 22.
But the outlook of both manufacturers' and non-manufacturers will likely worsen slightly in the short term as uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policies and an unstable political situation in Europe invite companies to be cautious. 
""We expect big manufacturers' mood improved broadly, helped by export recovery and continued yen weakness,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
""But the situation is extremely fluid, such as the prospects for President Trump's policy management and political risks in Europe."" 
Ueno added that prices were expected to rise in coming months, which would likely raise firms' worries about negative effects on consumers. 
The poll found the sentiment of big manufacturers will worsen to plus 13 in the coming three months and that of non-manufacturers will deteriorate to plus 18.
Big corporations were seen trimming their capital spending plans by 0.1 percent for the coming fiscal year from April, according to the poll.
""We expect firms' capital spending plan will be upgraded steadily later due to their ample cash flow on favorable profits,"" said Hideaki Kikuchi, an economist at Japan Research Institute.
""In addition, there is solid demand for investment to renew aging facilities and increase efficiency."" 
The BOJ will release the tankan quarterly sentiment survey at 8:50 a.m. on April 3 (2350 GMT on April 2).
A separate Reuters' monthly poll, which tracks the BOJ's quarterly tankan, showed last week that confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose for a seventh straight month in March to a three-year high, while the service sector's mood was steady.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese factory output rose at the fastest pace in eight months and the jobless rate hit a two-decade low in February, a sign a rebound in overseas demand continued to brighten prospects for the country's export-reliant economy.
But household spending remained soft and consumer inflation was flat when stripping away the effect of rising energy costs, underscoring the challenges the Bank of Japan faces in generating sustained price rises backed by steady wage growth.
The data may reinforce market expectations that while the BOJ's next policy move could be to withdraw its massive stimulus, the timing would be some time away, analysts said.
""We can tell that Japan's economy is benefiting from a cyclical pickup in the global economy,"" said Masamichi Adachi, senior Japan economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities.
""But corporates are reluctant to raise prices because consumption is weak ... The simple answer for the government and the BOJ is to wait and see.""
Industrial output rose 2.0 percent in February from the previous month, beating market forecasts for a 1.2 percent gain to mark the biggest increase since June last year, as automakers ramped up production of new models, data showed on Friday.
Separate figures showed Japan's jobless rate hit a 22-year low of 2.8 percent in February, down 0.2 percentage point from the previous month.
But household spending fell 3.8 percent in February from a year earlier, a bigger decline than market forecasts for a 1.7 percent drop, suggesting a tightening labor market has yet to drive up wages enough to boost consumption.
ECONOMY GOOD, PRICES WEAK
A rebound in energy costs pushed core consumer inflation to 0.2 percent in February, matching a median market forecast and marking the fastest annual pace in nearly two years.
But a separate consumer price index that excludes the effect of volatile fresh food and energy costs rose just 0.1 percent in February, suggesting that weak consumption was preventing companies from raising prices of non-energy items.
Tokyo core consumer prices, which are less influenced by gasoline costs and released a month ahead of nationwide figures, fell 0.4 percent in March from a year earlier. That was bigger than a 0.3 percent drop in February.
""While we still think price growth will continue to pick up, it's true the underlying trend isn't that strong,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Depending on oil and yen moves, it may take longer than expected for inflation to approach 1 percent,"" he said.
Japan's long-stagnant economy has shown signs of life in recent months, with exports and factory output benefiting from a recovery in global demand.
Analysts expect consumer inflation to accelerate near 1 percent later this year as the base effect of last year's oil price falls dissipates.
That has led to a dramatic shift in market expectations, with a majority of analysts polled by Reuters predicting the BOJ's next move would be to start scaling back its stimulus.
With inflation far from his 2 percent target, however, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed that he sees ""no reason"" to dial back the bank's massive stimulus program anytime soon.

BOJ officials have stressed that they would look at various data, not just the core consumer price figures, in determining whether underlying trend inflation is accelerating backed by solid economic growth. They argue that wage rises must accompany price gains for inflation to sustainably hit 2 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as robust consumer spending provided a boost that was partially offset by the largest gain in imports in two years.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate instead of the previously reported 1.9 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third GDP estimate for the period. 
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. Despite the upward revision to the fourth quarter, the economy grew only 1.6 percent for all of 2016, its worst performance since 2011, after expanding 2.6 percent in 2015.
There are signs that economic activity slowed further in the first quarter, with the trade deficit widening in January and both consumer and construction spending weakening. 
With the labor market near full employment, the data likely understate the health of the economy - GDP also tends to be weaker in the first quarter because of calculation issues the government has acknowledged and is trying to resolve.
""Some of this softness is due to seasonal adjustment issues that will reverse later in the year,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Consumer spending will lead growth thanks to higher incomes from more jobs and rising wages.""
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter.
Though the moderate growth pace has been sufficient to lower unemployment, it is a challenge to President Donald Trump's goal of boosting annual growth to 4 percent by slashing taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and cutting regulations.
The Trump administration has offered few details on its economic policies, but both business and consumer confidence have surged following the businessman-turned-politician's electoral victory last November.
After last week's failed attempt by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to repeal the Obama administration's 2010 healthcare law, economists say Trump faces a tough road ahead implementing his pro-growth agenda.
""The primary question is whether the next few years will resemble the last several years with growth of around 2 percent or whether better days lie ahead,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The dollar (DXY) was slightly stronger against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher. Economists polled by Reuters had expected fourth-quarter GDP would be revised up to a 2.0 percent rate.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter after rising at a 6.7 percent pace in the previous three months. 
Profits were held back by a $4.95 billion settlement between the U.S. subsidiary of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and the U.S. federal and state governments for violation of environmental regulations. As a result, the economy grew at only a 1.0 percent rate when measured from the income side, braking sharply from the 5.0 percent pace of growth in the third quarter. 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to a 3.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It was previously reported to have risen at a 3.0 percent rate. 
Consumer spending is being supported by a tightening labor market. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 25.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 108 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
Domestic demand increased at a robust 3.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace in two years. 
Some of the increase in demand was satiated with imports, which increased at a 9.0 percent rate. That was the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2014 and was an upward revision from the 8.5 percent growth pace reported last month.
Exports fell more than previously estimated, leaving a trade deficit that subtracted 1.82 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 1.70 percentage points.
Robust domestic demand and import growth meant stronger inventory investment than previously estimated. Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $49.6 billion in the last quarter, instead of the $46.2 billion reported last month. 

Business investment was revised lower to reflect a more modest pace of spending on intellectual property, which increased at a 1.3 percent rate instead of the previously estimated 4.5 percent pace.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>","German, Spanish inflation ebbs, easing pressure on ECB","By Michael Nienaber and Paul Day
BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - German and Spanish consumer inflation slowed more sharply than expected in March as oil prices slumped, data showed on Thursday, offering some respite to the European Central Bank as it faces pressure to wind down its monetary stimulus.
The ECB has slashed interest rates into negative territory and adopted a bond-buying program worth 2.3 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion) to counter the threat of deflation and revive growth in the 19-member currency bloc.
Euro zone inflation surged to a four-year high in February, zooming past the ECB's price stability target of just under 2 percent. But the central bank has said it first needs to see if inflation rises at the start of the year are sustainable in the medium term before considering changing policies.
German annual inflation, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), slowed to 1.5 percent in March after reaching a 4-1/2 year high of 2.2 percent in February, preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
The March reading marked the first slowdown in nearly a year and came in weaker than a Reuters consensus forecast of 1.9 percent. It pushed down Germany's 10-year government bond yield to a three-week low of 0.32 percent.
ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the drop should help the ECB in taming ""rate hike fantasies"", adding that falling oil prices and limited domestic inflationary pressures should lead to a gradual slowing of headline inflation in the second half of the year.
""Speculation about changes to the ECB's monetary policy stance are the result of a strengthening macro outlook and higher headline inflation,"" he noted.
""Nevertheless, the ECB, in our view, is not likely to quickly change policies - clearly not before the French presidential elections (in April and May),"" Brzeski added.
Several ECB policymakers argued on Thursday that the bank needed to stick to its already laid out policy path, though a top conservative urged them to leave the door open to a more rapid reduction in stimulus.
After the French elections, the ECB could give its first hints at a 2018 tapering of the bond-buying program, Brzeski said.
Spanish consumer price inflation also eased sharply in March as fuel and power prices fell.
The EU-harmonized inflation rate there slowed to 2.1 percent, flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed. This compared with a Reuters poll of 2.7 percent and with a reading of 3.0 percent in February.
""This is much lower than we'd expected and is principally due to the effect of oil prices,"" said Estefania Ponte, analyst at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Personal Investors in Madrid.
In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, energy prices and food costs rose less sharply than in February although both again were the main drivers behind the overall increase, a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed.
Economists partly put down the drop in German headline inflation also to calendar effects, since last year's Easter holidays came in March rather than, as this year, in April. This means some items such package holiday costs rose less sharply this March.

The inflation rate for the entire euro zone, due on Friday, is expected to have fallen to 1.8 percent in March from 2.0 percent in February, economists polled by Reuters said.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's data was unrevised.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 108 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The labor market is currently near full employment.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data. Claims for Louisiana and Hawaii were estimated.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 7,750 to 254,250 last week.
The labor market strength suggests that an apparent slowdown in economic growth at the start of year is probably temporary. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the first three months of 2017.
The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 65,000 to 2.05 million in the week ended March 18. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 1,250 to 2.03 million, the lowest level since June 2000.
The continuing claims data covered the survey week for March's unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims fell 31,000 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting some improvement in the unemployment rate.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sentiment toward the euro zone economy edged down but stayed buoyant in March, signaling faster growth as inflation expectations among businesses and consumers also rose, EU data showed on Thursday.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey showed the main index dipped to 107.9 points from 108.0 in February, remaining well above its long-term average of 100.
A Reuters poll had pointed to a slight rise to 108.3 points [nL5N1GG1RC], but economists remained upbeat about the 19-country bloc's growth prospects.
""While this release may have disappointed somewhat, it is still pointing to strength in economic activity,"" Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING said.
He noted the figures signaled the first quarter was the bloc's strongest since 2011, in line with predictions of faster economic growth in the first three months of the year.
Questions remained, however, whether that acceleration would extend into the second quarter.
The euro zone's economy grew 0.4 percent in the last three months of 2016 on the quarter, and 1.7 percent on the year. Preliminary estimates on the actual growth in the first quarter will be released by the EU statistics office on May 3. 
A separate business confidence indicator released on Thursday by the EU Commission was stable at 0.82 points in March, remaining at the highest level since June 2011 but also below market expectations for an increase to 0.86.
Inflation expectations among consumers and manufacturers went up, adding to signs that price pressures are normalizing and fuelling a debate about when the European Central Bank might unwind its monetary stimulus. 
The consumer index of price trends over the next 12 months rose to 15.3 points from 14.5 in February, the highest since October 2013, although the pace of the increase slowed down.
""Given that consumers' inflation expectations are rising only slowly, we nevertheless expect the ECB to continue asset purchases throughout the year and into 2018,"" said Stephen Brown, economist at Capital Economics.
European statistics office Euros tat will on Friday release flash estimates of euro zone inflation for March, with economists polled by Reuters expecting 1.8 percent, down from February's 2 percent and in line with the ECB's mid-term target of below but close to 2 percent. 
The indicator for selling price expectations among manufacturers rose to 9.8 points from 9.0 in February, the highest since July 2011.
The slight dip in overall economic sentiment was mainly due to less optimism in the services sector, the largest part of the euro zone economy and whose index dropped to 12.7 from 13.9 points, and in industry, where it fell to 1.2 points from 1.3. 

The drop of confidence in the two main economic sectors of the bloc was partially offset by more optimism among consumers, whose reading rose to -5.0 points from -6.2 points in February.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2017 06:23AM ET</span>","German inflation weaker than expected in March, state data suggest","BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer inflation probably slowed more than expected in March due to cheaper energy and food prices, falling back below the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent, regional data suggested on Thursday.
The surprisingly weak figures from several German states hinted that price pressures in Europe's biggest economy still remain relatively modest despite its continued upswing, booming labor market and the ECB's loose monetary policy.
The German data follows Spanish price figures that also showed consumer inflation eased sharply in March as fuel and power prices fell, feeding into the debate about the euro zone's monetary policy outlook.
In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 1.7 percent from 2.3 percent in February. It also fell back to 1.7 percent in Hesse and Bavaria. In the eastern state of Brandenburg, it dropped to 1.4 percent while it stood at 1.8 percent in Saxony.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT (8 a.m. ET).
A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested overall consumer price inflation fell to 1.9 percent in March from 2.2 percent in February, which was the highest rate since August 2012.
Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the state readings suggested that German inflation fell more sharply than expected in March to some 1.7 percent. She added that underlying price pressures would remain subdued.
""The labor market is in good health, but it has been for a long time and there are still few signs of strong upward pressure on wage growth,"" McKeown said.
Since core price pressures are much weaker elsewhere in the euro zone, the ECB is likely to maintain its view that the economic recovery has not put inflation on course to meet its medium-term goal, she added.
""We see it implementing its asset purchases as planned and keeping interest rates on hold for a long time to come.""
The inflation rate for the entire euro zone, due on Friday, is expected to have fallen to 1.8 percent in March from 2.0 percent in February, economists polled by Reuters said.
The ECB has slashed interest rates and adopted a bond-buying program worth 2.3 trillion euros ($2.47 trillion) to pump money into the region's economy.

The central bank has said it needs to see if inflation rises at the start of the year are sustainable in the medium term before considering changing policies which pump billions of euros into the euro zone economy through asset purchases.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian households saw their wealth balloon to a record A$11.7 trillion ($8.97 trillion) last quarter as cash holdings topped a trillion dollars for the first time ever, boding well for spending in the face of tepid wages growth.
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed households' net worth, after taking into account all their liabilities, rose 3.6 percent to A$9.4 trillion in the three months to December. 
Most of the gains came from a A$247 billion increase in home and land values, which took them to A$6.4 trillion. The country's annual economic output (GDP) is worth A$1.7 trillion.
This accumulation of wealth is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) considers household balance sheets to be in good repair overall, even as they fret about debt-fueled speculation in the property market.
""From a wealth standpoint, you would have to say Australian households are sitting pretty right now,"" said Savanth Sebastian, a senior economist at asset manager CommSec.
""Yes, the growth rate of debt is a concern. The longer it continues to outpace income growth, the more vulnerable households become,"" he added. ""But the asset side of the balance sheet is often overlooked and that's very strong.""
He noted that the net worth of every man woman and child in the country stood at almost A$387,000, a solid cushion to support spending in the face of sluggish wage growth.
While there has been much alarm at rising debt levels in Australia, little is made of the asset side of household balance sheets which makes the picture appear less threatening.
Mortgage debt in the country stands at A$1.7 trillion, yet that is equal to just 26.7 percent of the value of homes and land, suggesting home prices would have to fall a long way to put the average owner into the red.
The ration of all debt to all assets had also dipped to just under 20 percent, its lowest since early 2008.
Australians have also been squirreling away a pile of liquid assets. Cash and deposits alone topped A$1 trillion last quarter for the first time on record, having more than doubled over the preceding decade.
The ABS estimates the ratio of household debt to liquid assets, which includes cash, deposits, debt securities and shares, fell 1.1 percentage points to 124.4 percent in the December quarter.
That was considerably lower than the often-cited debt to disposable income ratio which is currently at record highs above 180 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes jumped to a 10-month high in February, pointing to robust demand for housing ahead of the busy spring selling season.
The report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors suggested higher home prices and mortgage rates were having little impact on the housing market for now, underscoring the economy's resilience despite an apparent slowdown in growth in the first quarter.
The NAR said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, surged 5.5 percent to 112.3. That was the highest reading since April and the second best showing since May 2006.
""This bodes well for home sales this spring,"" said Misa Batcheller, an economic analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Contract signing last month was likely boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures. The gains reversed January's 2.8 percent drop. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's surge implied a pickup in home resales after they tumbled 3.7 percent in February.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 2.4 percent last month. Pending home sales increased 2.6 percent from a year ago.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors assessed comments from Federal Reserve officials on further interest rate increases this year. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, one of the U.S. central bank's most consistent supporters of low interest rates, said he supported additional monetary policy tightening this year.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter percentage point earlier this month and has forecast two more rate hikes this year. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while U.S. stocks were mixed. U.S. government bond prices rose.
TIGHT INVENTORIES 
Demand for housing is being driven by a strong labor market, which is generating wage increases, as it nears full employment. Sales activity, however, remains constrained by tight inventories, which are driving up home prices.
""The good news is that warm winter weather has led to a surge in construction that will hopefully result in a bloom of new homes for sale this spring,"" said Joseph Kirchner, senior economist at realtor.com.
A report on Tuesday showed home prices increased 5.7 percent in January on a year-on-year basis. The NAR expects sales of previously owned homes to increase 2.3 percent this year to around 5.57 million units.
Existing homes sales increased 3.8 percent last year. Housing market strength suggests an apparent sharp slowdown in economic growth early in the first quarter is likely temporary.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the final three months of 2016.
Given labor market strength, economists expect only a modest impact from higher mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently at 4.23 percent, below a more than 2-1/2-year high of 4.32 percent hit in December.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home purchase loans rose 1.2 percent last week from the prior week. It was the fourth increase in the past five weeks.

Last month, pending sales of existing homes increased 3.4 percent in the Northeast and jumped 3.1 percent in the West. Contracts surged 11.4 percent in the Midwest and rose 4.3 percent in the South.

The expected pace is on par with the 6.8 percent growth logged in the fourth quarter, which was better than market expectations due to higher government spending and record bank lending.
The National Academy of Economic Strategy attributed the first-quarter expansion to a strong rise in factory-gate prices, rebounding corporate profits and increasing imports, Xinhua said.
""The focus of macro-economic policies should be in supply-side structural reforms to boost potential output in the long run,"" Wang Hongju, a researcher at the academy, was quoted by Xinhua as saying. 
In the first half of the year, GDP will grow by 6.7 percent. Industrial production is likely to increase moderately in the second quarter, while investment sees slightly slower growth, according to the think tank.

“Buyers came back in force last month as a modest, seasonal uptick in listings were enough to fuel an increase in contract signings throughout the country,” NAR chief economist Larry Yun said.
“The stock market's continued rise and steady hiring in most markets is spurring significant interest in buying, as well as the expectation from some households that delaying their home search may mean paying higher interest rates later this year,” he added, while also noting that warm weather in February also played a role in buyers searching for a home.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's vast manufacturing sector likely grew for an eighth straight month in March as a surprise rebound in the property market added to a construction boom, boosting sales of building materials from steel to cement, a Reuters poll showed.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to stay at 51.6 in March, the same as in February which was the second-highest reading since July 2014, according to a median forecast of 31 economists in a Reuters poll.
While that is well above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction, over a dozen cities have announced fresh property cooling measures in recent weeks to slow home price rises, raising questions over how long the solid pace of growth can be sustained.
Home sales rebounded in the first two months of the year with an increase in new starts, defying previous government curbs to contain bubbly prices in big cities such as Beijing.
""Many projects started in March as it is usually the peak season,"" said Shen Jianguang, analyst at Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.
Profits of Chinese industrial firms surged almost 32 percent in the first two months of 2017 -- the fastest pace in nearly 6 years -- as prices of commodities from coal to iron ore raced higher.
But iron ore futures prices in China have retreated in the past week, with high inventories adding to fears that supply is threatening to outpace demand.[IRONORE/]
Some China watchers think the wave of property tightening measures announced since late last year will eventually slow home sales and prices.
""The market will certainly freeze under the new measures. Sales may drop 90 percent,"" said Yi Xianrong, a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - a state think tank - and now a professor at Qingdao university.
The outlook for China's manufacturing sector is also clouded by U.S. protectionist rhetoric that could hurt exports to its biggest trading destination, although no major U.S. measures have been announced.
Tighter monetary policy may also dent investor confidence in the sector.
The central bank has been cautious, bumping up money market and short- and medium-term interest rates several times this year by only modest amounts. But analysts said its tightening bias will eventually pass through to higher borrowing costs for Chinese companies.
The official PMI number will be released on March 31, along with the official services PMI.
The private Caixin/Markit PMI survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, will be published on April 1.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales were effectively flat in February as consumers cut back on food and durable goods after employers offered the lowest spring wage increases in four years.
Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in February from a year ago, well below the median estimate for a 0.5 percent annual increase, and much less than year-on-year growth of 1.0 percent in January.
The anemic figures raise further doubt about the strength of private consumption, emphasizing how difficult it will be for Japan's economy to generate sustained wage growth and price inflation, as envisaged in the government's ""Abenomics"" policies.
""I was expecting consumption to pick up in January-March, but so far things look weak,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""This reflects concerns that wages this year won't rise as fast as last year. Some people are also feeling the pinch from higher energy prices.""
The data showed that spending on foodstuffs fell an annual 1.5 percent in February, the first decline in five months.
Spending on durable goods fell an annual 2.2 percent in February versus a 0.8 percent annual decline in the previous month.
Spending on general daily goods fell 5.1 percent from a year ago, considerably faster than January's a 2.9 percent annual decline.
Most major Japanese companies offered their lowest increase in base pay in four years at annual spring wage negotiations this year in a setback to consumer spending and overall economic activity.
In addition, a rise in crude oil prices last year and a falling currency have pushed up prices of gasoline, which is also starting to hurt consumer sentiment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence surged to a more than 16-year high in March amid growing labor market optimism while the goods trade deficit narrowed sharply in February, indicating the economy was regaining momentum after faltering at the start of the year.
The economy's strengthening fundamentals were underscored by other data on Tuesday showing further increases in house prices in January. Robust consumer confidence and rising household wealth from the home price gains suggest a recent slowdown in consumer spending, which has hurt growth, is likely temporary. 
""We think that real consumption will firm moving forward,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. 
""It looks likely that the recent spending data were held down by some temporary factors related to unusually mild weather and a delay in tax refund issuance.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped 9.5 points to 125.6 this month, the highest reading since December 2000. Consumers' assessment of both current business and labor market conditions improved sharply in March.
They also anticipated an increase in their incomes. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the strongest since 2001. 
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It is consistent with continued reduction in slack in the labor market, which is near full employment.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell slightly. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) on track to snap an eight-day losing streak.
Both consumer and business confidence have surged in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in last November's presidential election. The Trump administration has pledged to pursue business friendly policies, including tax cuts and deregulation.
The Conference Board said the cutoff date for the survey results was March 16. This was a week before Republicans in the House of Representatives failed to pass health legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a stunning political setback for Trump. 
The failure to push through legislation to overhaul the health care system stirred concerns in markets about the difficulties Trump may have in implementing other policies, including tax reform.
""The question then is whether or not consumers will remain upbeat if legislation stalls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""At some point, those hopes for a stronger economy will fade if legislative victories remain elusive.""
JOBS BOOSTING CONFIDENCE
While other economists expected a pull back in confidence in April, they said household optimism was being driven by the labor market's health and not Trump's promises. Labor market strength could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in June, they said.
""Recovery is what the survey indicates and, more to the point, the answers on jobs and income are rooted in current experience not expectations for what Trump will or won't do,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard.
""If reality pans out as consumers and we expect, the Fed has three more hikes to go before the year is done.""
The Fed raised rates a quarter percentage point at two of its last three meetings, most recently earlier in March. The survey showed increases in consumers planning to buy cars and major appliances. There was, however, a drop in intentions to purchase a home after recent strong gains.
Separately, the Commerce Department said in its advance economic indicators report the goods deficit fell 5.9 percent to $64.8 billion last month as imports and exports fell. It also said inventories at retailers and wholesalers both rose 0.4 percent last month.
The data prompted economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to raise their first-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.6 percent annualized rate.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lifted its forecast to a 1.5 percent pace from a 1.0 percent rate.
""The recent widening, in our view, reflected the stabilization and rise in energy prices, as some of the improvement in nominal goods imports reflects petroleum,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. ""In addition, we think the widening in the trade deficit reflected the end of the multi-year industrial recession in the U.S."" 
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.7 percent in January on a year-over-year basis after increasing 5.5 percent in December. House prices are being driven by tight inventories.
Economists expect further price gains despite rising mortgage rates.

""Very tight market conditions suggest that price growth will continue at similar rates for the rest of this year, as rising earnings and high levels of confidence support housing demand even as mortgage interest rates rise,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

Lending to households in the 19-member currency bloc picked up to 2.3 percent in February from 2.2 percent a month earlier, its best rate since December 2010 suggesting that the ECB's cheap cash is slowly making its way to the household sector.
Corporate lending growth meanwhile slowed to 2.0 percent from 2.3 percent a month earlier, its lowest rate since June and possibly breaking its recent trend for slow but steady acceleration.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2017 01:32AM ET</span>",China Jan-Feb industrial profits surge 32 percent as commodity prices rally,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits of Chinese industrial firms surged 31.5 percent in the first two months of 2017 from a year earlier as prices of commodities from coal to iron ore raced higher, while strong imports also pointed to a pick-up in activity.
Stronger earnings could give a further boost to fixed-asset investment, which quickened early in the year, and give China's ""smokestack"" industries more cash flow to start whittling away at a mountain of debt -- a key government priority this year.
Total industrial profits over the first two months of the year were 1.01 trillion yuan ($147 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Monday.
The increase was mostly due to faster growth in prices of coal, steel and crude oil, He Ping, a statistics bureau official, said in a note accompanying the statement.
The pace of profit growth picked up sharply from a 2.3 percent increase in December.
Industrial profits rose 8.5 percent in 2016, snapping back from a slight drop in 2015, largely due to a sharp increase in prices of coal as well as raw materials such as iron ore which were needed to help feed a construction boom.
China's economy got off to a strong start to 2017, supported by robust bank lending, a government infrastructure spree and a much-needed resurgence in private investment.
The government boosted spending at the start of the year, with outlays rising 17.4 percent in Jan-Feb, compared to 12 percent growth over the same period in 2016.
Industrial firms stand to benefit from fixed-asset investment that expanded more than expected in the first two months of the year, including a 27.3 percent increase in infrastructure spending.
Shares of infrastructure companies have shot to a near 15-month high in Shanghai.
Asia's largest oil refiner, state-owned China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec), said on Sunday it expected a rise of about 150 percent in its first-quarter profit thanks to an increase in global crude prices.
Sinopec plans to boost capital expenditure to 110.2 billion yuan this year, up 44 percent from last year.
But investors in China are being torn between data showing a resilient economy and fears that expected policy tightening, while gradual, will eventually lead to higher borrowing costs and stunt business activity.
Producer prices rose at the fastest pace since 2008 in February on the back of stronger demand and government-mandated cuts in excess capacity.
However, most economists and even the statistics bureau believe producer price gains may soon start to slow.
""The base effects are not going to be as flattering in coming quarters. We're going to see a decline in profit growth and producer price inflation from now onwards,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
""We shouldn't get too excited about some of these growth rates.""
Further clouding the outlook, steel and iron ore futures prices in China posted their biggest weekly drop in three months last week as high inventories raised concerns that demand in China is not picking up as much as had been expected.
AS GOOD AS IT GETS?
Evans-Pritchard says China is near a peak after a recovery from a cyclical downturn, with policy tightening and slower credit growth eventually going to drag on growth.
""There is a real risk that by the end of the year the economy could be looking quite a bit weaker. I think all those signals suggest that this quarter is probably as good as its going to get,"" he said.
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 6.6 percent year-on-year as of end-February.
The statistics bureau gives combined figures for the first two months of each year to smooth out seasonal distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year holidays, when most companies are closed for the celebrations.
The profit figures cover large enterprises with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2017 11:10PM ET</span>",South Korea manufacturers to boost capital investment in 2017 vs 2016: central bank survey,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean manufacturers are expected to spend more on capital investment this year than they did last year, although those expenditures will be conservative and mostly geared towards maintaining facilities than expansion, a central bank survey showed on Monday.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) said a snap survey of 271 manufacturers nationwide showed 66.7 percent of respondents were planning to expand facilities investment this year versus the 33.9 percent who said their investments would decline in 2017.
The survey was part of a quarterly central bank report on the regional economy.
On an annual basis, capex declined for three consecutive quarters in 2016 as companies balked at boosting investment in the face of global and local uncertainties. In the fourth quarter, capital investment managed a 1.5 percent gain over a year earlier.
Revised fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth data will be announced on Tuesday.
This year, companies in sectors such as information technology (IT), petrochemicals, oil refining and car production were expected to boost investment, the central bank survey showed.
Capital investment across the board was expected to be conservative, with companies focusing on maintenance, repairs and boosting the efficiency of existing facilities.
The BOK said protectionist policies were gaining traction globally. Combined with uncertainty stemming from domestic and foreign conditions, these policies could hamper investment.
The central bank added that exports were expected to continue rising in coming months, with shipments of semiconductors, displays and smartphones likely to increase.

Exports rose for a fourth straight month in February and at the fastest pace in five years as global demand strengthened. The government expects now March exports will also post a rise. Full-month figures for March will be announced on April 1.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board members said easy monetary policy will be in place for some time because consumer price growth is still distant from the central bank's 2 percent inflation target, a summary of opinions from their March 15-16 meeting showed on Monday.
Members dismissed the notion that the BOJ would have to raise its 10-year government bond yield target due to gains in bond yields overseas, and instead said it should focus solely on the domestic economy.
However, some members did express concern about the BOJ's ability to control the 10-year yield in the future.
""Some market participants argue that the Bank needs to change the monetary policy in response to the rise in the long-term yields overseas,"" one member said.
""However, the monetary policy in Japan should be decided based on Japan's economic activity and prices. It will be a considerable length of time before the Bank will need to change its monetary policy.""
At the meeting, the BOJ kept policy on hold and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda pushed back against speculation that the BOJ will raise its target for the 10-year bond yield sometime this year.
The BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target of minus 0.1 and a pledge to guide the 10-year government bond yield (JP10YT=RR) at around zero percent.
It also kept intact a loose pledge to maintain the pace of its annual increase in Japanese government bond (JGBs) holdings, which is 80 trillion yen ($723.98 billion).
The economy has shown signs of life recently with stronger exports and industrial production, but concerns about the vigor of domestic demand linger because core consumer prices rose only 0.1 percent on-year in January.
One member was doubtful about the price trend because wage increases for next fiscal year, which starts in April, are likely to be less than the current fiscal year, the summary of opinions showed.
The BOJ increased its government debt purchases substantially last month to cap a rise in yields, which revealed the weakness of the BOJ's policy to control the shape of the yield curve, another member said.

This suggests the BOJ could be forced to purchase a large amount of government debt in the future to achieve its yield target, this member said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in February, but a surge in shipments amid demand for machinery and electrical equipment supported expectations for an acceleration in business investment in the first quarter.
Manufacturing is recovering from a prolonged slump, driven by the energy sector, bucking a slowdown in the broader economy. The Federal Reserve last week described business investment as appearing to have ""firmed somewhat."" 
""The evidence is building that manufacturing activity is on something of an upswing and that capital spending on business equipment is poised to advance for the second consecutive quarter,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in January. That suggested a slowdown in business spending in the second quarter.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods jumped 1.0 percent after declining 0.3 percent in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Last month's jump reflected increases in orders at the end of 2016. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.6 percent last month. 
Orders for machinery inched up 0.1 percent while shipments increased 0.9 percent. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components advanced 2.2 percent, the biggest increase in seven months, and shipments rose 1.5 percent.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid drama surrounding efforts by Republicans to repeal Democratic President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act and overhaul the healthcare system. 
Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives called off a planned vote late on Friday because of a lack of support despite desperate lobbying by the White House and its allies in Congress, dealing a stiff setback to President Donald Trump.
Stocks on Wall Street ended down, while the dollar was little changed. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose.
""What the healthcare bill does is serve as the first litmus test of the Trump/Republicans' ability to deliver on important legislative initiatives,"" said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities in New York. 
""If they fail at this then the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure and defense spending will need to be rethought.""
MANUFACTURING RECOVERING
A recovery in oil prices from multi-year lows is driving demand for equipment in the energy sector, helping to lift the manufacturing sector.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy is also being underpinned by a burst of confidence amid promises by the Trump administration to slash taxes for businesses, boost infrastructure spending and repeal some regulations. 
Details of the fiscal stimulus package, however, remain vague, resulting in a moderation in orders for equipment in the last couple of months. Economists say business spending could slow in the second quarter even as they expect an acceleration this quarter. 
A separate report on Friday from data firm Markit showed its U.S. manufacturing sector index fell in March to a five-month low.
""Business optimism has been at cycle highs since the start of the year, but has yet to translate into commensurate strength in real activity,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Economics in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Spending on equipment is expected to pick up after a 1.9 percent annualized growth pace in the fourth quarter. Still, that will likely be insufficient to offset the drag on GDP from slower consumer spending and a wider trade deficit. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting the economy growing at a 1.0 percent rate in the first quarter after expanding at a 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of 2016. 
Last month, a 4.3 percent jump in demand for transportation equipment offset the dip in core capital goods bookings, and hoisted overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, 1.7 percent. Durable goods orders rose 2.3 percent in January. 
Civilian aircraft orders soared 47.6 percent in February, driven by an increase in plane orders at Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.8 percent in February, while orders for defense aircraft declined 12.8 percent. There were increases in orders for primary metals, but orders for fabricated metal products fell as did those for computers and electronic products.

Unfilled orders for core capital goods increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in January. Inventories of overall durable goods rose 0.2 percent last month.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) eased to 52.9 in March, from the prior month’s reading of 53.8. That was a six month low.
Analysts had expected the reading to increase to 54.2.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.

The composite PMI, including activity in both sectors, fell to 53.2 from February’s reading of 54.1. That was a six-month low.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson indicated that the slowdown for a second straight month suggested that the economy is struggling to sustain momentum and that the survey results were consistent with GDP growth of 1.7% for the first three months of 2017, compared to 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in March will increase almost 1.9 percent from a year earlier, even as consumer discounts continue to remain at record levels, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
March U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.62 million units, up about 1.9 percent from 1.59 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 16 selling days of the month.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 17.3 million vehicles, up from 16.8 million a year earlier.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to increase 1 percent in March.
Highlighting ""policy uncertainty"" over whether Republican U.S. President Donald Trump will press ahead with plans for a ""border tax"" on imported vehicles, LMC and J.D. Power said they were maintaining their 2017 sales forecast of 17.6 million vehicles, an increase of 0.2 percent from 2016.
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016.
But as the market has begun to saturate, automakers have been hiking incentives to entice consumers to buy.
The consultancies said industry incentive spending was $3,768 per new vehicle sold, the highest ever for the month of March. The previous record for the month was set in 2009, during the height of the Great Recession.
In a statement, Deirdre Borrego, senior vice president of automotive data and analytics at J.D. Power, said the ""competitiveness of the industry continues to be evident in ever-rising incentive levels."" 

Incentives as a percentage of a manufacturer's suggested retail price were at 10.4 percent in March, exceeding 10 percent for the first time in the month since 2009, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said.

LONDON (Reuters) - If the latest surveys of business intentions are to be believed, the euro zone economy is sparkling, growing at a pace that easily explains the hints from some European Central Bank policymakers of a pull-back from their easy-money regime.
IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an influential guide to the buying plans of businesses and hence growth, hit a near six-year high this month.
It climbed to 56.7 from February's 56.0, its highest reading since April 2011 and better than any predictions in a Reuters poll.
At the same time, flash surveys for the currency bloc's two largest economies -- Germany and France -- also stormed past expectations to register near six-year highs, conditions likely to play into elections in both countries this year. 
""This is a really solid rate of expansion. It's an economy firing on all cylinders,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said of the euro zone.
He added that it implied first quarter economic growth of 0.6 percent quarter on quarter, which would be the joint highest reading since the first quarter of 2011. 
One immediate impact may be to put pressure on the ECB to begin rolling back its historically easy monetary policy, a combination of zero to negative interest rates and a large asset-buying program.
Earlier this month the ECB pledged to extend its bond-buying program to at least the end of the year, citing weak underlying inflation and lackluster growth in the euro zone. It will, however, reduce its monthly spend from April.
It also highlighted that it no longer felt a ""sense of urgency"" to take further action.
Since then some ECB policymakers, notably Austria's Ewald Nowotny and Italy's Ignazio Visco, have spoken of a rate hike within or just after the period of the bond-buying program.
""These (PMI) numbers will likely reinforce the ECB's view that downside risks are diminishing. But the central bank will only tighten gradually,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The key will be inflation, control of which is the ECB's primary mandate.
Markit's euro zone PMI sub-index measuring prices charged by businesses rose to a near six-year high of 53.3.
Inflation in the euro zone was 2.0 percent in February -- around the ECB's target.
""What we are picking up is an increase in suppliers' ability to hike prices due to strong demand. If that continues to intensify the ECB should become more worried,"" Markit's Williamson said.
FRACTURING THE FORECASTS
All nine of Friday's PMI reports -- manufacturing, services and composite for the euro zone, France and Germany -- beat even the most optimistic forecasts in Reuters polls of economists.
France's composite registered 57.6 in March from 55.9 in February, a particularly significant rise given the country's economy is generally lagging and this put it above Germany.
How such data plays into the French presidential election, the first round of which is in April, remains to be seen.
National Front candidate Marine Le Pen will be hoping to capture votes from those angry with their economic lot. But the two other leading candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Francois Fillon are both calling for economic reform. A hefty chunk of the electorate has yet to decide who to vote for, if the polls are anything to go by. 
Germany's PMI was driven mainly by strong demand for manufactured goods from the United States, China, Britain and the Middle East.
The manufacturing index -- reflecting more than two-thirds of the economy -- rose to 57.0 from 56.1 in February.

Such growth may well increase Germany's current account surplus, a bone of contention between Berlin and others from Washington to Brussels.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors increased to 56.7 in March, from the prior month’s reading of 56.0 and above forecasts a drop to 55.8. That was its highest reading since April 2011.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index also unexpectedly rose to 56.5 this month, from February’s final reading of 55.5, beating expectations for a reading of 55.3.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 this month from a final reading of 55.4 in February. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 55.3 in March.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The eurozone economy’s throttle opened further in March, with business activity and hiring surging higher,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
“The March flash PMI rounds off the best quarter for six years and signals GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter,” he added.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.0795 compared to 1.0802 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8645 from 0.8643 earlier.

The reading suggests that growth in Europe's largest economy will accelerate in the first quarter. 
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks activity in the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 57.0 from 56.1 in February.
The reading, a 70-month high, overshot the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The survey showed that activity among manufacturers accelerated to a 71-month high and in the services sector it was the highest rate of growth in 15 months.
""The PMI data strongly suggest that economic growth will accelerate in the first quarter,"" said Markit economist Trevor Balchin.
Companies responded to the rising demand by speeding up hiring: the rate of job creation almost matched a record set six years ago.
Inflationary pressures rose again with steel, oil and the strong U.S. dollar cited as key sources of cost pressures, Markit said, forcing companies to partially pass on the higher costs to customers.
Germany's inflation rate rose to 2.2 percent in February from 1.9 percent a month earlier, driven mainly by rising energy and food costs.
Markit said it forecasted headline inflation to reach 2.1 percent in 2017.
Output expectations also strengthened in March and in the services sector sentiment was strongest in more than six years.
""The March flash PMI results rounded off a strong first quarter for the Germany economy,"" Balchin said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose for a seventh straight month in March to a three-year high, while the service sector's mood held steady, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting an export-led economic recovery.
The Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan - found confidence at both manufacturers and service-sector firms up from three months ago, pointing to an improvement in the central bank's survey due April 3.
In the poll of 531 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between March 7-21 in which 254 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 25 from 20 in February, led by materials firms such as oil refinery/ceramics, textiles/paper and steel/nonferrous metals.
It was the highest reading since April 2014, but is expected to drop to 23 in June. Compared with three months ago, the sentiment index was up nine points.
The Reuters Tankan comes as Japan's long-stagnant economy shows signs of life, with exports and factory output benefiting from a global economic recovery, although consumer spending has remained sluggish.
Exports grew the most in more than two years in February even as a widening trade surplus with the United States potentially raises tensions in the face of rising U.S. protectionism under President Donald Trump.
""Exchange rates are stable at around 115 yen, providing a good environment for our clients, many of whom are exporters,"" a manager at a nonferrous metals producer wrote in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
Manufacturers cited stability in exchange rates, brisk demand for smartphones, and a pick-up in demand from China as factors underpinning their sentiment.
Some companies were concerned about uncertainty over the outlook for global economy, while others complained about sluggishness in private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of Japan's economy, the world's third largest.
The Reuters Tankan service-sector index held steady at 26 in March, with retailers and wholesalers rebounding from the previous month's slump.
It was seen slipping to 24 in June. Compared with three months ago, the sentiment index was up seven points.
The central bank's last tankan in December showed sentiment among big Japanese manufacturers improved for the first time in six quarters to hit a one-year high, as a weak yen and a pick-up in global demand brightened prospects for exporters.
The Reuters Tankan's sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2017 05:14PM ET</span>",New home sales hit seven-month high; jobless claims rise,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales jumped to a seven-month high in February, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining momentum despite higher prices and rising mortgage rates.
Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. Still, the labor market continues to tighten, which together with the strength in housing, should underpin economic growth.
""New home sales are the secret sauce that helps make the economy grow,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""This will put some backbone in investment spending and make this economic expansion more sustainable."" 
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. Sales have now more than recouped the sharp drop suffered in December.
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of the overall market, rising 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units in February. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to a year ago, showing the housing market's resilience despite reduced affordability. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.30 percent. House prices increased 5.7 percent in January from a year ago, according a government report published on Wednesday. 
Last month's new home sales were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving job opportunities for young adults.
""Rising mortgage rates don't appear to have been much of an impediment to increasing housing demand in February as solid job gains, faster wage growth, and stronger household formations offset the drop in affordability,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 18.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 80 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970 when the labor market was smaller. The job market is currently near full employment. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,000 to 240,000 last week.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on whether the House of Representatives would pass a Republican-sponsored bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, which is seen as the first significant policy test for President Donald Trump.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index (HGX) gaining 0.7 percent. U.S. government bond prices fell while the dollar (DXY) rose slightly against a basket of currencies.
LABOR MARKET FIRMING
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for March's nonfarm payrolls report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,750 between the February and March survey weeks, suggesting another month of strong job gains.
Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. Tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation enabled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last week. 
""The claims data do not suggest a clear shift in labor market conditions between the reference periods for the February and March reports,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale. A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February.
Last month, new single-family homes sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South. They jumped 7.5 percent in the West but slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast.
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of its peak during the housing boom in 2006. 

At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday re-started publishing a key economic indicator - money supply - after an unexplained month-long break.
The datapoint is important given the dearth of information about inflation and economic growth in the midst of a crisis involving soaring prices and food shortages.
Venezuela's M2, an element of money supply, is up just under 190 percent in the last year, compared to 7.0 percent in neighboring Colombia and 6.0 percent in the United States.
An increase in money supply is a major factor in Venezuela’s soaring inflation, given that the country is not producing goods or services to back up the extra money in circulation.
The indicator suddenly stopped appearing on the central bank's website on Feb. 24 though reappeared Thursday.
Neither the central bank nor information ministry responded to a request for comment.
President Nicolas Maduro blames the crisis on an ""economic war"" waged by the political opposition and United States. Critics blame failing socialist policies and accuse the government of suppressing data in order to hide the magnitude of the economic mess.

By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell more than expected in February amid a persistent shortage of houses on the market that is pushing up prices and sidelining prospective buyers.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales declined 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units last month after hitting a 10-year high in January.
Sales were up 5.4 percent from February 2016, underscoring the sustainability of the housing market recovery despite the supply constraints. The median house price surged 7.7 percent from a year ago to $228,400 in February. That marked the 60th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
""There is a small supply of homes for sale and great demand for them, and that's driving prices higher in many markets. We believe the strong appetite for homes will continue, people just need more homes to choose from,"" said Gino Blefari, chief executive officer at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) HomeServices in Orange County, California. 
Economists had forecast sales decreasing 2.0 percent last month. In February, houses typically stayed on the market for 45 days, down from 59 days a year ago. Despite February's sales drop, the housing market was on track to again contribute to economic growth in the first quarter through increases in homebuilding and broker commissions.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused instead on potential delays to President Donald Trump's economic agenda, including his pledge to cut taxes.
The PHLX housing index fell 0.5 percent. U.S. stock indexes were mostly weaker while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. 
Economists said there were few signs sales had been significantly affected by rising mortgage rates. Although annual wage growth has stubbornly remained below 3 percent, economists expect an acceleration as the job market, which is near full employment, tightens further.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering at 4.30 percent.
The Federal Reserve last week raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent. The U.S. central bank has forecast two more rate hikes for 2017.
LAND, LABOR SHORTAGES
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association onWednesday showed applications for loans to purchase homes fell 2.7 percent last week from near a four-month peak.
""Despite supply constraints, we see a resilient labor market and solid real income gains as likely to support a decent pace of home sales ahead, although given the backup in rates we may experience some pullback in the near term,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), a senior economist at Natwest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. 
Last month, sales fell in the Northeast, West and Midwest regions, but rose in the South. Though the number of homes on the market increased 4.2 percent to 1.75 million units last month, housing inventory remained near the all-time low of 1.65 million units hit in December. Supply was down 6.4 percent from a year ago.
Housing inventory has dropped for 21 straight months on a year-on-year basis. Builders have been unable to fill the inventory gap, citing rising prices for materials, higher borrowing costs, and shortages of lots and labor. 
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN), the second-largest U.S. homebuilder, reported on Tuesday a drop in quarterly gross margin as the company struggled with higher land and construction costs. 
Lennar, however, sold 5,453 homes in the first quarter ended Feb. 28, up from 4,832 homes in the year-earlier period, and reported a 12 percent jump in orders.
The NAR estimates housing starts and completions should be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to alleviate the chronic shortage. Housing starts are running above a rate of 1.2 million units and completions around a pace of 1 million units.
At February's sales pace, it would take 3.8 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 3.5 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. While higher prices are increasing equity for homeowners and might encourage some to put their homes on the market, they could be hurting first-time buyers, who accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month.

That was well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market but up from 30 percent a year ago.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2017 11:20AM ET</span>",Mexico inflation rises at fastest pace in nearly eight years,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican annual inflation rose at its fastest pace in nearly 8 years in early March, prompting central bank chief Agustin Carstens to hint at higher interest rates to combat an inflation ""bubble"" he said would subside later in the year.
The headline inflation rate for the year through mid-March was 5.29 percent <MXCPHI=ECI>, the national statistics institute said on Thursday. The figure was the highest since the second half of February 2009, and was above expectations of economists polled by Reuters for 5.25 percent.
Mexico's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate last month to a nearly eight-year high after a steep hike in gasoline prices and weakness in the peso sparked by Donald Trump's election as U.S. president.
Just after the data was published, Carstens said the central bank had room to continue adjusting rates.
The peso has recovered as U.S. officials have taken a more conciliatory tone toward Mexico and the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would stick to gradual interest-rate increases.
Still, many analysts expect the central bank to lift rates again on March 30 following the Fed as inflation climbs.
The core price index <MXCPIC=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.32 percent in the 12-month period to mid-March.
The figure was above the 4.29 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.

In the first half of March, consumer prices rose 0.35 percent <MXCPIF=ECI> while the core price index <MXCPIH=ECI> climbed 0.31 percent.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016.
January's sales pace was revised up to 558,000 units fromthe previously reported 555,000 units. New home sales have now recouped a sharp drop suffered in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of overall home sales, gaining 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units last month.
New home sales, which are derived from building permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to February 2016, showing the housing market's resilience.
Sales last month were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving employment opportunities for young adults. The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale.
A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February amid tight inventories and rising house prices. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently around 4.30 percent.
Last month, new single-family homes sales slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast region. Sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South.
They jumped 7.5 percent in the West. The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of what it was at its peak during the housing boom in 2006.
At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median price for a new home fell 4.9 percent to $296,200 in February from a year ago.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending March 18 increased by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 from the previous week’s total of 243,000 which had been revised from an initial reading of 241,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 1,000 from the original reading to 240,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended March 11 decreased to 2.000 million from 2.039 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.030 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to settle at 2.035 million.
The four-week moving average was 240,000, a rise of 1,000 from the previous week's revised reading of 243,000 (initially 237,250).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2017 03:21AM ET</span>",German consumer sentiment unexpectedly falls heading into April - GfK,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - German consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in five months going into April, a survey showed on Thursday, partly due to people's concerns that rising inflation will erode their purchasing
power.
The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 9.8 going into April. Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected the headline figure to remain unchanged at 10.0.
GfK said people's economic expectations and propensity to buy picked up, while the third component of the index - personal income expectations - fell for the second month in a row.
""A rise in inflation in Germany and the resultant intensified concerns over income buying power have obviously hindered full recovery of consumer sentiment,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Germany's inflation rate rose to 2.2 percent in February from 1.9 percent a month earlier, driven mainly by rising energy and food costs.
Citing a 10 percent fall in the price of crude in the first half of March, GfK said it expected inflation to fall below 2 percent in the coming months.
It expects rising shale oil production in the United States to add to downward pressure on crude prices.
""Experience shows that Germans react sensitively to changes in certain signal prices, such as petrol, diesel or heating oil,"" Buerkl said. ""In particular, they see the purchasing power of their income impaired by rising energy prices.""
Despite the slight fall in sentiment, the survey showed that the people remained ready to spend.
The propensity to buy rose, making up for most of the losses in previous months, largely thanks to the robust labor market.
""The stable employment market trend is obviously of greater importance, since it reduces the fear of job losses, thus
providing for a higher level of planning security, especially when it comes to larger purchases,"" Buerkl said.
The index measuring economic expectations also rose after falling in February on fears that protectionist policies pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump could hurt the economy.
""Uncertainty amongst many consumers with regards to the policies of the new U.S. president has given way to a greater level of economic optimism again,"" Buerkl added.

For the full-text statement, see:
Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.75 percentRelease date23 March 2017Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 1.75 percent.
Macroeconomic indicators in advanced economies have been positive over the past two months. However, major challenges remain with on-going surplus capacity in the global economy and extensive geo-political uncertainty.
Global headline inflation has increased, partly due to a rise in commodity prices, although oil prices have fallen more recently. Core inflation has been low and stable. Monetary policy is expected to remain stimulatory, but less so going forward, particularly in the US.
The trade-weighted exchange rate has fallen 4 percent since February, partly in response to weaker dairy prices and reduced interest rate differentials. This is an encouraging move, but further depreciation is needed to achieve more balanced growth.
Quarterly GDP was weaker than expected in the December quarter, but some of this is considered to be due to temporary factors. The growth outlook remains positive, supported by on-going accommodative monetary policy, strong population growth, and high levels of household spending and construction activity. Dairy prices have been volatile in recent auctions and uncertainty remains around future outcomes.
House price inflation has moderated, and in part reflects loan-to-value ratio restrictions and tighter lending conditions. It is uncertain whether this moderation will be sustained given the continued imbalance between supply and demand.
Headline inflation has returned to the target band as past declines in oil prices dropped out of the annual calculation. Headline CPI will be variable over the next 12 months due to one-off effects from recent food and import price movements, but is expected to return to the midpoint of the target band over the medium term. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at around 2 percent.
Monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period. Numerous uncertainties remain, particularly in respect of the international outlook, and policy may need to adjust accordingly.

Companies signed up for $5.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down 3 percent from a year earlier. Their borrowing fell 5 percent from January.
""This slow start belies the business-friendly environment that many business and economic commentators point to in characterizing the new administration in Washington,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 74.8 percent in February, down from 75.4 percent in January.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or subsidiaries of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index fell to 71.1 in March from 72.2 in February.

A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

""Realtors are reporting stronger foot traffic from a year ago, but low supply in the affordable price range continues to be the pest that's pushing up price growth and pressuring the budgets of prospective buyers,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

The Washington-based industry group said its measure on mortgage applications fell 2.7 percent to 406.8 in the week ended on March 17. Last week, it was 418.1, which was the highest level since 460.30 in the week ended on Nov. 18.
Average interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, held for a second week at 4.46 percent, a level last seen in April 2014. 
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less and that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Rates on conforming 30-year loans were steady despite a decline in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) following the Federal Reserve's assurance after a two-day policy meeting that it still planned to raise rates gradually.
Mortgage rates on some fixed-rate home loans that the MBA tracks increased from the preceding week. The 30-year rate on loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration averaged 4.33 percent, the highest since January 2014.
The group's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan fell 3.3 percent to 1,366.1. Last week, it reached 1,413.3, the highest since the week ended on Dec. 16.

TOKYO/SHIZUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board member Yukitoshi Funo on Wednesday joined other policymakers in hosing down speculation of a near-term withdrawal of the central bank's massive monetary stimulus, saying it was premature to consider raising the BOJ's bond yield target.
While offering an optimistic view on Japan's economic prospects, the former Toyota executive said it was uncertain whether companies would raise wages to help accelerate inflation to the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.
""Inflation is still low compared with our target. We're not in a condition to consider shifting monetary policy, such as by adjusting our yield target,"" Funo told reporters after meeting business leaders in Shizuoka, eastern Japan.
Funo's comments follow the central bank's minutes for its January meeting released on Wednesday, which showed some of the board's nine members rejected suggestions the BOJ should raise its 10-year government bond yield target to match expected gains in Treasury yields.
These members said the BOJ should focus solely on meeting its 2 percent inflation target, a difficult task due to worries about overseas economies and inflation expectations.
""Although some market participants speculated that the Bank might consider raising the target level of the long-term interest rate in response to such factors as a rise in the U.S. long-term interest rates, its monetary policy decisions should be made solely based on the viewpoint of aiming to achieve the 2 percent price stability target,"" some members said.
The BOJ does not identify board members in the minutes of its policy meetings.
At the Jan. 30-31 policy meeting, the BOJ raised its growth projections but warned that prospects for hitting its 2 percent inflation target remained uncertain.
The BOJ also maintained its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent.
Funo has voted with the majority of the board including a decision in September to shift the BOJ's policy framework to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said earlier this month that an uptick in inflation toward 1 percent won't immediately prompt an interest rate hike.
NO AUTOMATIC TRIGGER
Many traders and economists expect Treasury yields to rise this year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
This tends to also push up Japanese government bond yields, which could make it more difficult for the BOJ to control the shape of the yield, some economists say.
Other economists argue that Japanese bond yields will rise on their own as domestic inflation starts to pick up, which will also put pressure on the BOJ's 10-year yield target.
Funo warns Japanese firms may remain cautious about raising wages, which means consumer inflation may not hit 2 percent before Kuroda's term ends in April next year.
He declined to elaborate on the conditions that must be met before the BOJ considers withdrawing stimulus, saying they would vary depending on economic circumstances at the time.

""There's no set conditions that would automatically trigger (a hike in the yield target),"" he said.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2017 01:53AM ET</span>","Japan Feb exports jump, surplus with U.S. raises fears of trade tensions","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports grew the most in more than two years in February, rebounding from a Lunar New Year slowdown in January, as a widening trade surplus with the United States potentially raises tensions in the face of rising U.S. protectionism.
Annual export growth of 11.3 percent topped a 10.6 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a 1.3 percent rise in January, marking the biggest gain since January 2015, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday.
Exports to the United States rose 0.4 percent in February from a year ago, largely from bigger shipments of cars and auto parts.
Any rise in Japan's trade surplus with the United States could be a cause of concern for Japanese policymakers, given that U.S. President Donald Trump has singled out Japan, China and Germany for their high net exports into the U.S. market.
""Japanese policymakers must be sensitive about trade surplus with the United States. The trade surplus is not at an alarming level, but is historically very low. However, such a logical argument may not get across to Trump,"" said Tomoyuki Ota, head of the economic research department at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The fact that the trade surplus with the United States has been driven by rising car exports may cause Trump to pile pressure on Japanese carmakers to boost investment in America.""
Japan and the United States will start a high-level economic dialogue in mid-April, with Tokyo seeking ways to avoid trade friction on issues such as car exports by proposing an agenda focused on investment in U.S. infrastructure.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose an annual 1.5 percent to 611.3 billion yen ($5.48 billion), posting the first increase since November although it had dropped a revised 26.5 percent in January.
EXPORT-LED RECOVERY
The trade data highlighted an economic recovery led by overseas demand although the rebound from a Lunar New Year slowdown in China and other parts of Asia in January played a large part.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 28.2 percent year-on-year in February, accelerating from a 3.1 percent gain in the previous month.
Demand for auto parts from China and for electronics components from Hong Kong contributed to export growth in February.This performance helped Japan log a surplus of 111.8 billion yen with China - its first in five years.

Analysts said February's 8.3 percent growth in the volume of exports, and average export volume growth of around 4 percent in January and February, was a positive sign for Japan's export-reliant economy in the current quarter.

Speaking in Bali, Indonesia, on Wednesday Rosengren said the ""sharp"" rise in apartment prices in particular in the U.S. may signal financial instabilities that interest rates, which are only gradually rising, may not be able to contain.
""Because real estate holdings are widespread, and the monetary and macroprudential tools for handling valuation concerns are somewhat limited, I believe we must acknowledge that the commercial real estate sector has thepotential to amplify whatever problems may emerge when we at some point face an economic downturn,"" Rosengren said in prepared remarks for delivery to a banking supervision conference.
Meanwhile, Mester said on Tuesday that if the economic data holds up she supports the U.S. central bank taking steps that would begin to reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet and sees more than three rate hikes, higher than the Fed's overall median forecast.
""I actually built into my forecast more than three because I have the economy a bit stronger,"" she said, adding that three or more rate increases this year would put the Fed in ""good shape."" Mester is not a voter on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year but participates fully in deliberations.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Business sentiment at Asia's top companies rose to its highest in almost two years in the first quarter of 2017, buoyed by positive economic signs from the United States and China that underpinned improved global demand, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> , representing the six-month outlook of 96 firms, rebounded to 70 for January-March from 63 three months prior. A reading over 50 indicates a positive view.
During the quarter, the United States and China - two top destinations for Asian exporters - reported a slew of upbeat economic data that was far better than market expectations.
""Optimism about the U.S. economy, lack of immediate crisis in China, lack of bad news in Europe ... have reduced some of the immediate risks,"" said Singapore-based economics professor Antonio Fatas at global business school INSEAD. 
Sentiment in export-oriented Malaysia rebounded the most, with its subindex jumping 20 points to a three-year high of 75, as most respondents reported an increase in business volume and a third said staffing had risen in the past three months. Sentiment also surged in the Philippines by 18 points, with a subindex of 88 making the country the most optimistic in Asia. 
In other export-driven Asian countries too, such as Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, corporate sentiment improved significantly, while China and India recorded a slight decline from the previous quarter.
""Stronger-than-expected export numbers have provided quite a relief for those economies, at least more than they have for China or India which are more domestically oriented,"" said Santitarn Sathirathai, head of emerging Asia economics at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Singapore.
But for Chinese companies such as beauty app Meitu (HK:1357), strong domestic appetite for new services and goods in the country also points to a brighter business outlook that will see user traffic translate into profit.
""The fact that Chinese consumers are demanding upgraded products and services for beauty and entertainment is the basis of our confidence in business outlook in the next six months,"" a spokesman said.
While the United States remains a powerful player in Asia, Asian economies have stepped up trade with China, whose growing presence was highlighted after the U.S. withdrawal earlier this year by President Donald Trump from the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership.
Fearing trade retaliation by China over the deployment of a new missile system, on top of a political crisis that led to the ouster of President Park Geun-hye, South Korean firms' business sentiment - the weakest of 11 economies polled - tumbled 32 points to a subindex of 25, the lowest in almost five years. China is South Korea's largest trading partner.
OVERLY OPTIMISTIC?
Economists say the current high level of optimism may have been built on shaky ground as a series of risk events are expected to re-emerge soon.
""There's a lot of positive sentiment around but there's a risk that people are simply extrapolating forward the recent better news,"" said Capital Economics' chief Asia economist Mark Williams. 
Despite the broader improvement in sentiment in the region, uncertainty over Trump's policies, U.S dollar rate and demand from China were still seen as the biggest risks to Asian companies' outlooks.
""The same confidence in the U.S. is met by many respondents worried about Trump policies,"" INSEAD's Fatas noted, adding that Europe will be ""back in the risk lists"" as French elections, whose results could fuel growing global trade protectionism sentiments, are just around the corner.
Credit Suisse's Sathirathai said China's focus on stability this year ahead of a major power reshuffle also means Beijing is less keen to splurge on stimulus, which could potentially impact trade-dependent Asian nations.
China concluded its annual parliament meeting last week, at which policymakers set a more modest growth target in 2017 as it turns to tackling financial risks.
Thomson Reuters and INSEAD polled companies from March 3 to 17. Of 96 respondents, 48 percent rated their six-month outlook as positive, 43 percent were neutral and 8 percent were negative.
The Asia Pacific branch of British publishing company Taylor & Francis Group, part of  Informa  Plc (L:INF), was cautious about its outlook. Barry Clarke, managing director of Asia Pacific at the group, said that was partly because last year was much better than expected. ""We wouldn't expect the same kind of growth.""
FINANCIAL FIRMS MOST UPBEAT
By sector, companies engaged in financial services were the most upbeat with the subindex rising to a near four-year high of 75 from 61 in the previous quarter, driven by optimism about a normalization of monetary policy globally and a rollback in onerous regulations.
The auto industry recorded the biggest jump in sentiment by increasing 27 points to 67 in the quarter. 
Sentiment was the lowest in the metals and chemical sector, falling to negative territory for the first time with a subindex at 40. The sector mentioned U.S dollar rate among its biggest concerns.
Respondents included Australia's Medibank (AX:MPL), India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), Bank Rakyak Indonesia (JK:BBRI), Japan's Suzuki Motor (T:7269) and SoftBank (T:9984), Malaysia's Kossan Rubber (KL:KRIB), Union Bank of the Philippines (PS:UBP) and Thailand's Intouch Holdings (BK:INTUCH). 
The index started in 2009 with a record low of 45, but has largely hovered between 60 and 70 since hitting a record high of 80 at the beginning of 2011.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2017 09:57AM ET</span>","UK inflation shoots above two percent, adding to Bank of England conundrum","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation shot past the Bank of England's 2 percent target last month, potentially adding to uneasiness among some officials at the central bank about keeping interest rates near zero.
Consumer prices rose by a stronger-than-expected 2.3 percent, the biggest annual increase in nearly three-and-a-half years, pushed up by an increase in global oil prices and the impact of the Brexit vote on sterling.
Last week, one of the BoE's policymakers voted to raise record-low borrowing costs because of growing inflation pressures and the economy's resilient response so far to Britain's decision last June to leave the European Union.
Other policymakers said they could soon follow suit, depending on inflation and growth data.
February's rise represented the first time in more than three years that inflation topped the BoE's target, but Governor Mark Carney said it was important not to overreact to a single month's data.
Carney has previously warned of ""twists and turns"" ahead for Britain's economy as the country prepares to leave the EU, a process Prime Minister Theresa May will start next week.
And most BoE policymakers have noted how slowly wages are growing, another reason to keep rates low.
But Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the latest data would do little to reassure those BoE rate-setters who are more concerned about higher inflation.
""If the economy continues to hold up well as we expect, interest rates could be rising rather sooner than the markets have been anticipating,"" she said in a note to clients.
The increase in the annual inflation rate between January, when it stood at 1.8 percent, and February was the steepest since October 2012, the ONS said.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected inflation would rise to 2.1 percent. 
Sterling hit its highest level against the U.S. dollar in three weeks after the data. British government bond prices fell.
HIT TO CONSUMERS, HELP TO FACTORIES
While the fall in the value of the pound has pushed up inflation, it has also given a boost to manufacturers whose exports are more competitive in foreign markets. A recovery in the global economy is also helping British factories.
Optimism among British factories surged to a 22-year high in March as exports rebounded, a survey showed.
Britain's vote to leave the EU last June caused the pound to slide, pushing up the price of imports. Furthermore, global oil prices have risen, adding to the squeeze on the spending power of households. 
The BoE has said it expects inflation will peak at 2.8 percent in the second quarter of next year, but many economists say it is likely to hit 3 percent. The BoE underestimated the extent of inflation's rise after the global financial crisis in 2007-09 which also caused a sharp fall in sterling. 
Inflation has also accelerated in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.
The ONS said transport costs, which were pushed up by rising fuel costs, were the biggest driver of inflation in February.
Also, food prices rose in annual terms for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years. Excluding oil and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose to 2.0 percent, above the Reuters poll forecast of 1.8 percent.
Data on factory gate prices underscored the inflationary pressures still in the pipeline. Output prices rose 3.7 percent in annual terms, the strongest increase since the end of 2011.

Prices paid by factories for materials and energy surged with the cost of crude oil, almost doubling from a year earlier.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. current account shrinks in fourth quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit unexpectedly fell in the fourth quarter, hitting its lowest level in more than a year, as an increase in the primary income surplus offset a soybean-driven drop in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell 3.1 percent to $112.4 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2015.
The current account deficit for the third quarter was revised up to $116.0 billion from the previously reported $113.0 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit rising to $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
The fourth-quarter current account deficit represented 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in the third quarter. For all of 2016 the current account deficit totaled $481.2 billion, a 3.9 percent increase from 2015.
That represented 2.6 percent of GDP, unchanged from 2015.
The current account deficit has dropped from a record high of 6.3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as rising domestic oil production and lower global oil prices curbed the import bill.
Goods exports fell $3.4 billion to $371.7 billion in the fourth quarter. That reflected an $8.4 billion decrease in the export of food, mainly soybeans. Exports were also crimped by the dollar, which gained more than 5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in the fourth quarter.
The surplus on primary income - which includes investment income such as dividends, and employee compensation - increased $19.9 billion. Primary income receipts increased $4.4 billion to $207.9 billion, reflecting increases in direct investment income, mostly equity and portfolio inflows.
The deficit on secondary income, U.S. government grants, pensions, fines and penalties, and worker remittances rose to $41.5 billion from $41.4 billion in the third quarter.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly balance of output expectations in the coming three months rose to +36 from +33 in February, its highest level since February 1995.
The survey also showed export orders growing at the fastest pace since December 2013. However, the total order book balance held steady at +8 in March, which may suggest a slightly weaker influx of domestic orders given the large improvement in exports.
""The past fall in the pound seems finally to be helping lift demand for UK manufactured exports, which rose at one of the fastest paces in this survey's history,"" said Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence.
Official data earlier this month showed British factories enjoyed their strongest growth in nearly seven years in late 2016 and early 2017 and exports rose quickly, likewise suggesting a boost for manufacturers from sterling's fall after the Brexit vote.
But sharply rising inflation has been one side-effect from the pound's plunge.
""(Cost) pressures are widespread, and manufacturers expect factory-gate prices to continue to rise strongly over the next three months. And this will also put pressure on prices generally.""

Data earlier on Tuesday showed British factory gate prices rose 3.7 percent in February, the biggest increase since December 2011.

Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board
Sydney – 7 March 2017
Members PresentPhilip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna
Others PresentLuci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department)Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary)
International Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of international developments by noting that forecasts by private sector analysts for growth in the major economies in 2017 had been revised upwards since mid 2016. Growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade had picked up further and survey measures of business conditions had remained at high levels. Headline inflation in the major advanced economies had increased noticeably in recent months, largely as a result of higher oil prices, to be close to most central banks' targets. However, core inflation had generally remained low.
The Chinese National People's Congress had announced a growth target for the Chinese economy in 2017 of around 6.5 per cent (or higher, if possible), which is only slightly lower than the pace of growth recorded for 2016. This suggested that the authorities would continue to use policy to support near-term growth. However, policymakers had also increased their focus on addressing the risks to longer-term growth. The People's Bank of China had signalled a reduction in monetary stimulus, reflecting concerns about rising financial stability risks, and the target for growth in total social financing had been lowered slightly to 12 per cent. Additional measures had also been put in place to curb rapid housing price growth in some cities. Members noted that there had been a pick-up in the growth of non-bank and off-balance sheet lending.
In the United States, consumption had been the key driver of expenditure growth over 2016, supported by continuing improvements in labour market conditions. Investment intentions had picked up significantly and the number of active oil rigs had increased in response to the higher level of oil prices. Fiscal policy was also expected to be expansionary under the new administration and the US economy was expected to grow above its potential rate in 2017. Members noted that the volume of trade destined for the United States had fallen significantly as a share of total global trade since the late 1990s. Nevertheless, a move to more protectionist policies would still be damaging for the medium-term outlook for both the US and global economies. Above-average growth in unit labour costs, higher oil prices and more expansionary fiscal policy were all expected to contribute to a further rise in core inflation, which had increased since 2015 to be only a little below the Federal Reserve's goal.
The euro area and Japanese economies had grown faster than their potential growth rates over 2016, resulting in further improvements in labour market conditions. The unemployment rate in the euro area had fallen to its lowest level in seven years, while the unemployment rate in Japan had declined to a two-decade low. In both economies, core inflation had remained low, while headline inflation had increased, largely as a result of higher oil prices. In the euro area, headline inflation had increased to be consistent with the European Central Bank's target. Measures of inflation expectations in both economies had been steady or had increased.
Members observed that merchandise exports had picked up for the euro area and Japan towards the end of 2016. A significant increase in merchandise exports had also contributed to growth in East Asia. Members noted that the increase in global trade over the second half of 2016 had been underpinned by an improvement in global economic conditions, both for Australia's major trading partners and other parts of the world that were important sources of external demand for output from East Asia.
Australia's terms of trade had risen by around 15 per cent over the second half of 2016 and were expected to rise again in the March quarter. In February, prices for iron ore, base metals and crude oil had all reached their highest level in more than a year, although the price of coking coal had fallen from its peak in November. Some reversal in the terms of trade was still expected, although the recent improvement in global demand suggested that higher commodity prices could be more persistent than previously anticipated. Members noted that generalised strength in commodity prices tended to indicate an improvement in global demand conditions, but that factors affecting the supply of commodities had also affected prices.
Domestic Economic Conditions
GDP growth in the December quarter of 1.1 per cent had been above expectations. The outcome partly reflected the reversal of some of the temporary factors that had contributed to the fall in output in the September quarter. Most notably, there had been a solid pick-up in export growth in the December quarter; in addition, growth in both consumption and business investment had been higher than expected. Total nominal income had risen strongly, driven by growth in mining sector profits as a result of the higher terms of trade; in contrast, growth in labour incomes had been unusually weak.
The mining sector had contributed to growth in the December quarter, reflecting higher exports and an unexpected increase in investment. Members observed that some resource firms may have been able to increase their exports to take advantage of higher commodity prices by running down inventories. Consistent with previous staff forecasts, the capital expenditure survey of investment intentions continued to indicate that mining investment would fall further over the following year or so, but that the drag on growth would dissipate over this period.
Non-mining business investment had risen in the December quarter, largely as a result of higher non-residential construction, although machinery and equipment investment had also risen. Non-mining business investment had picked up over the previous two years or so and business conditions had been more positive in recent months. In contrast to these more positive signs, non-residential building approvals had declined further and the capital expenditure survey continued to suggest that, in aggregate, firms do not intend to increase their spending on non-mining investment over the following year or so. Members observed, however, that this survey does not cover some important sectors, including education and health, and also does not include investment in intellectual property, which has become an increasingly important share of non-mining business investment in the national accounts measure. Members noted that in most sectors there had been little evidence that non-mining business investment had been held back by lack of access to credit.
Dwelling investment had rebounded in the December quarter; much of the strength had been concentrated in New South Wales. Even though building approvals had fallen significantly in recent months, the substantial amount of building work in the pipeline suggested that dwelling investment would continue to contribute to growth in coming quarters. Conditions in established housing markets had continued to differ significantly across the country. Over recent months, conditions appeared to have strengthened in Sydney and had remained strong in Melbourne; these cities had continued to record brisk growth in housing prices, and auction clearance rates had remained high. Housing loan approvals and credit growth had picked up for investors, primarily in New South Wales and Victoria. In contrast, housing prices and rents had fallen in Perth for two years or so, and apartment prices had declined in Brisbane.
Rural exports had grown strongly in the December quarter, reflecting strong farm production following favourable weather conditions in many areas over the second half of 2016. As a result of this and the higher prices for bulk commodity exports, there had been a trade surplus in the December quarter for the first time in almost three years. The current account deficit had narrowed to less than 1 per cent of GDP, the smallest deficit since 1980; the trade surplus was partly offset by a widening in the net income deficit as some of the increase in mining profits had accrued to foreign owners.
Household consumption growth, which had been relatively subdued in mid 2016, picked up in the December quarter, consistent with retail sales. Liaison with retailers suggested that recent trading conditions had been around average and household perceptions of their personal finances had also been around average.
The pick-up in consumption growth stood in contrast to the ongoing weakness in labour incomes, with the household saving ratio declining in the December quarter. Members noted that over the past two decades movements in the Australian household saving ratio had been much larger than those in other similar economies. One contributing factor was likely to have been that Australia had experienced a much larger terms of trade cycle than other developed economies with significant commodity exports. Differences in the evolution of household saving ratios across the states suggested that the terms of trade had played an important role in households' saving and spending decisions.
Indicators of labour market conditions had remained mixed. Employment growth had picked up in recent months and the unemployment rate had edged down to 5.7 per cent in January. Leading indicators, including job advertisements and firms' employment intentions, suggested that there could be some pick-up in employment growth in the near term. Members noted that although experience had varied across the states, in recent years employment growth had generally been stronger in the capital cities than in regional areas. Employment growth had continued to be concentrated in part-time jobs over the past year and wage growth had remained low, suggesting that the labour market had not been quite as strong as the headline employment and unemployment rate figures had indicated.
The wage price index had increased by 1.9 per cent over 2016, in line with the staff forecasts. Subdued wage growth appeared to have been broad based and was most pronounced in mining-related industries and states. Average earnings per hour in the national accounts had fallen sharply in the December quarter, as had the wage bill as a share of nominal GDP. Although quarterly movements in average earnings per hour are volatile, this measure of wage growth had also been subdued in year-ended terms, continuing to suggest there was very little labour cost pressure in the economy. Members noted that the recent experience of low inflation may also have contributed to lower wage outcomes and that other business costs, such as rents, are often linked to inflation. Members observed that although credit growth was lower than in previous decades, it had been faster than the subdued growth in household incomes.
Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion by noting that global financial markets had been relatively quiet over the preceding month, with market participants focused on evolving expectations about the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, the new US administration's policies and national elections in Europe in coming months. Globally, monetary policy remained very stimulatory and financing remained readily available on favourable terms.
Financial market participants' expectations for an increase in the federal funds rate at the March meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had risen to over 90 per cent. This followed continued positive economic news in the United States as well as statements by FOMC members. Members noted the widely held expectations for no change in monetary policy settings in the euro area and Japan, compared with the general view earlier in the previous year that further monetary easing was in prospect in these economies.
In major markets, 10-year government bond yields remained above their lows of mid 2016, reflecting the run of more positive economic news since then, as well as expectations that the new US administration's policies would support US growth. Members observed that, although euro area government bond spreads to German government bonds had increased over recent months in response to political developments, yields remained relatively low by historical standards. Corporate bond yields in developed markets remained very low, with spreads to government bonds having narrowed markedly over the previous year, particularly for non-investment grade bonds. Australian government bond yields had been little changed over the month and the spread to US Treasury yields had also been steady at a low level. As in other markets, Australian corporate bond spreads had narrowed over the preceding year.
Global equity prices had moved higher over the prior month in response to continued positive economic data. In the United States, financial sector share prices had increased strongly following the new administration's orders for a review of financial market regulations. In the euro area, banks' share prices had declined following lower-than-expected earnings, which were largely related to loan-loss provisions. Over the previous year or so, Australian share prices had moved broadly in line with those in the rest of the world excluding the United States, where share prices had risen further. Recent Australian company earnings results had been generally positive, driven by strong profits in the resources sector.
The US dollar had been little changed over the prior month in nominal trade-weighted terms, while the euro had depreciated a little against the US dollar, in part reflecting political uncertainty around the upcoming national elections. The Chinese renminbi had been broadly unchanged over the preceding month against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms.
Members noted that the People's Bank of China had tightened monetary policy a little and indicated that further tightening was likely in response to rising inflationary pressures and to address leverage, including of financial institutions. The tightening had flowed through to increased corporate bond spreads; recent bond issuance in China had been weak after a sustained period of strength, although yields had remained low. In emerging markets more broadly, financial market conditions had been favourable and flows into emerging market funds had resumed as the global economic outlook had improved since mid 2016.
The Australian dollar had been little changed over the prior month and had remained more than 10 per cent higher against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms since early 2016, reflecting the significant increase in commodity prices since then.
Members observed that Australian banks' funding costs and average outstanding housing and business lending rates were estimated to have been broadly steady over recent months. Interest rates had increased slightly over prior months for some investor and interest-only housing loans.
Financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected the cash rate to remain unchanged at the March meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent data had continued to support a more positive outlook for growth of Australia's major trading partners than had been apparent a few quarters earlier. A number of indicators, including growth in global industrial production, global trade volumes and business sentiment, had improved. Recent data had also confirmed the pick-up in global inflation. Financial market data suggested that the probability of the Federal Reserve increasing the federal funds rate at the March meeting had increased markedly and there was no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in other major economies. At the same time, however, there continued to be significant uncertainty about policy in China and the United States and the implications for global growth and trade after 2017.
Domestically, there had been a significant increase in the terms of trade in the second half of 2016 and many commodity prices had risen further in recent months. Although mining companies were expected to increase their dividend payouts following the sharp rise in mining sector profits in the December quarter, a significant proportion of shareholders are non-residents, which would limit the flow-through to an increase in household incomes in Australia. However, the fact that the recent increases in commodity prices had been supported by a pick-up in global demand raised the possibility that commodity prices could be higher than expected, in which case the flow-through to the domestic economy could be larger than currently forecast.
The Australian economy had continued to make its transition following the end of the mining investment boom, supported by the low level of interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013. GDP growth had picked up in the December quarter to be around 2½ per cent over 2016, which was only a little below estimates of the medium-term potential growth rate of the economy. This outcome confirmed that the weakness in the September quarter was temporary. Looking forward, year-ended growth was expected to pick up gradually to be above its potential rate over the forecast period. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate the adjustment of the economy following the end of the mining investment boom.
Momentum in the labour market remained difficult to assess, but it was clear that spare capacity remained and there continued to be significant differences in labour market outcomes across the country. Domestic wage pressures remained subdued and household income growth had been low, which, if it were to persist, would have implications for consumption growth and the risks posed by the level of household debt. Spare capacity was expected to decline slowly as momentum in the economy built; wage growth and underlying inflation were expected to rise, but only gradually.
Recent data continued to suggest that there had been a build-up of risks associated with the housing market. In some markets, conditions had been strong and prices were rising briskly, although in other markets prices were declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next few years. Growth in rents had been the slowest for two decades. Borrowing for housing by investors had picked up over recent months and growth in household debt had been faster than that in household income. Supervisory measures had contributed to some strengthening of lending standards.
Given all of these considerations, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 01:40PM ET</span>",Brazil's inflation likely eases to 4.7 percent in mid-March,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate probably approached the center of the official target in mid-March as food prices continued to ease and a long recession curbed the increase of services prices, according to a Reuters poll of economists on Monday.
Consumer prices probably rose by 4.73 percent in the 12 months through mid-March, slowing from an increase of 5.02 percent in mid-February, according to the median of 25 forecasts that ranged from 4.68 to 4.82 percent. <BRIPCY=ECI>
The government targets inflation at 4.5 percent.
Prices are expected to have risen just 0.15 percent in mid-March from mid-February, down from a rise of 0.54 percent in the previous month, according to the median of 26 estimates that varied between 0.11 percent and 0.20 percent.
The mid-March inflation numbers will be released on Wednesday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT).
Falling inflation is expected by economists and investors to prompt the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate cuts at its next meeting in April and drive rates down to 8.50 percent by the end of 2018 from the current 12.25 percent.
""One of the best harvests in a decade should keep food prices down, while a stronger currency should help fuel prices, following the new fuel adjustment policy,"" economists with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a research note.
The economists led by Arthur Carvalho estimated that inflation in services prices, considered to be more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity than industrial goods, probably slowed to the lowest rate since 2008.
Brazil's sudden inflation slowdown highlights the unprecedented severity of the country's two-year recession and is helping President Michel Temer's economic team to restore the credibility of fiscal and monetary policy to curb price rises.
Price increases have undershot market expectations for seven straight months, according to Reuters polls. As a result, most economists expect the government to reduce its inflation target later this year for the first time in more than a decade.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's red-hot property market picked up pace in February after price gains had slowed in the previous four months, with average new home prices in 70 major cities edging up in spite of a raft of new government curbs aimed at tempering speculative demand. 
Compared with a month earlier, new home prices rose 0.3 percent, quickening from January's 0.2 percent increase, according to Reuters calculations from data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Saturday.
The monthly gain in price growth suggested speculation has yet to be contained even with more local governments rolling out restrictive measures amid fears that a furious rally over the past year end in a crash. 
China's property sales unexpectedly surged in the first two months of the year despite government measures to cool the market, though growth in real estate investment eased slightly, according to official data released on Tuesday. 
RAISING THE BAR, AGAIN
Recent weeks have seen the biggest wave of tightening of home purchase and lending rules since October, a sign that prices remains strong as investors gamble the measures so far won't contain prices. 
On Friday, Beijing's municipal government announced new steps to rein in its housing market, increasing the minimum down payment for second home purchases in the city to at least 60 percent from 50 percent. 
Prices for new homes in Beijing were flat month-on-month in February, while second-hand home prices rose 1.3 percent. 
Guangzhou's city government on Friday said unmarried people and non-local residents will only be allowed to buy one home in the city from Saturday. The minimum down payment on second homes will also be raised to 50 percent.
Hot markets Hangzhou and Nanjing were among other major cities to step up their fight against property speculators, as authorities fret over resurgent price growth that has shown only modest signs of abating. 
Speculators also appeared to be venturing into smaller markets that have more relaxed housing purchase policies. Surging price growth in satellite cities near some of the country's sprawling metropolises have prompted authorities in those areas to impose purchases bans. 
Shijiazhuang, for example, capital of Beijing neighbor Hebei province, on Saturday imposed home purchase restrictions for the first time since 2014, according to a post on the website of the Shijiazhuang government. 
Non-local residents will be limited to one house in the city, and the minimum down payment for residents on second homes was raised to 40 percent. 
Shijiazhuang home prices rose 18.2 percent year-on-year in February and 0.2 percent from January. 
BIG CITIES SLOWING 
New home prices rose 11.8 percent from a year ago, compared with January's 12.2 percent gain, according to NBS data. That was the slowest in five months as gains in the biggest cities dropped off.
Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing prices rose 13.5 percent, 21.1 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively, in February from a year earlier, all slower than January's annual growth rates.
On a monthly basis, Shenzhen prices fell 0.6 percent and Shanghai gained 0.2 percent. 
Home prices in the smaller market of Hefei, capital of eastern Anhui province, rose the fastest among the 70 cities surveyed at 40.5 percent year-on-year, though still falling 0.2 percent on-month.

China's policymakers have vowed to keep the property market stable and stem speculation this year, with the government adding to its work report after the annual parliament closed on Wednesday a pledge to contain fast-rising home prices.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2017 01:14PM ET</span>","U.S. factory, consumer sentiment data boost economic outlook","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory output increased for a sixth straight month in February while consumer sentiment rebounded in early March, underscoring the economy's resilience even as growth appears to have slowed significantly in the first quarter. 
That was supported by other data on Friday showing a gauge of future economic activity rose in February to its highest level in more than a decade. The improving outlook backs the Federal Reserve's decision this week to raise interest rates.
""First-quarter growth is likely to disappoint, but that is not the full economic story,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There are other segments that are starting to pick up the slack.""
The Fed said manufacturing production increased 0.5 percent last month after a similar gain in January. That was the biggest back-to-back increase in three years. Rising commodity prices are boosting demand for machinery and other equipment.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is regaining ground as the prolonged drag from lower oil prices, a strong dollar and an inventory overhang fades. It is also benefiting from a surge in business confidence amid promises by the Trump administration to pursue business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and deregulation.
""Manufacturing is set to do well for a change, after several years of lagging far behind,"" said Michael Montgomery, a U.S. economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""The sector is racking up solid growth, that is a very welcome change at beleaguered factories."" 
The dollar fell to a five-week low against a basket currencies, remaining under pressure for a third straight session, after the Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis, but stuck to its gradual pace of monetary policy tightening.
Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt were trading higher.
SENTIMENT RISES 
President Donald Trump's pledges to boost economic growth and employment have also been embraced by Americans, leading to a jump in consumer sentiment. In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose 1.3 percentage points to a reading of 97.6 in early March.
The survey's measure of current conditions was the highest since 2000 as households grew optimistic about their finances. That reflects two straight months of job gains above 200,000. 
While Trump's election has buoyed confidence among households and businesses, that has not translated into a surge in either business or consumer spending as details of the administration's economic policy remain vague.
""Despite the favorable news on sentiment, real consumer spending has been looking pretty soft in recent months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
In a third report on Friday, the Conference Board said its leading economic index increased 0.6 percent in February to its highest level in over a decade. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 0.9 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, braking after the fourth quarter's 1.9 percent pace.
February's solid increase in manufacturing output was insufficient to lift industrial production, which was unchanged because of a 5.7 percent weather-driven plunge in utilities generation. Industrial production fell 0.1 percent in January. 
Mining output increased 2.7 percent last month, lifted by a 7.1 percent surge in oil and gas well drilling. 
Last month, manufacturing output was boosted by a 0.8 percent rebound in the production of motor vehicle and parts. Machinery output increased 1.1 percent. 
There were also increases in the production of primary metals, fabricated metal products and nonmetallic mineral products. Computers and electronic products output rose 0.7 percent last month.
With manufacturing output accelerating, capacity utilization -- a measure of how fully factories are deploying their resources -- rose 0.3 percentage point to 75.6 percent last month, the highest since October 2015. Still, it remains 2.8 percentage points below its long-run average.

""Business surveys have shown an encouraging pickup in investment plans since the election, but for now low capacity utilization rates are providing limited urgency to ramp up capex immediately,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

Eurostat said the 19-country currency area recorded a 0.6 billion euro ($646.4 million) deficit in January in its trade balance with states outside the bloc.
It is the first deficit, unadjusted for seasonal factors, since January 2014. Deficits are not unusual in January, when winter demand for energy can peak and export of other products, such as food and drink, slow.
Euro zone exports grew by 13 percent in January on the year to 163.9 billion euros, but the rise was counterbalanced by a 17 percent increase of imports, which totaled 164.5 billion euros, unadjusted figures showed.
Compared with December, figures adjusted for seasonal factors showed a 0.6 percent drop of exports in January and a 4.1 percent rise of imports.

Over the whole of last year, euro zone exports to the rest of the world were stable at a volume of around 2 trillion euros, Eurostat data showed. Imports went down 2 percent from 2015, while trade among euro zone countries was up 1 percent to a volume of 1.7 trillion euros.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports probably rose at the fastest pace in two years in February thanks to a softer yen and improving global demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
But uncertainty over possible trade protectionist moves by the United States is still clouding recovery prospects for the world's third-largest economy.
Exports are expected have jumped 10.6 percent in February from a year earlier, which would be the biggest gain since January 2015 when they rose 16.9 percent.
The number were likely flattered by a rebound in Asian demand, after Japan's shipments slowed in January due to the long Lunar New Year holidays in China and other parts of the region. Shipments had edged up 1.3 percent in January.
Imports likely rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier, slowing sharply from growth of 8.5 percent in January, which marked their first increase in two years.
That is expected to produce a trade surplus of 822.0 billion yen ($7.25 billion), compared with a deficit of nearly 1.09 trillion yen in January, the poll of 20 analysts showed.
""You need to average out exports in January and February to assess the trend considering the impact from the Lunar New Year holidays,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Research Institute.
""Still, there is a chance that an average of exports in January and February surpassed that of October-December. And data next week will be something to confirm exports stayed on a recovery trend as the manufacturing sector is picking up globally.""
The finance ministry will release the trade data at 8:50 a.m. JST on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday.) 
Japan's trade surplus with the United States has been declining. But if it starts rising again, it could become a flashpoint after President Donald Trump singled out Japan, China and Germany for their high exports into the U.S. market.
In April, Japan and the United States will start a high-level economic dialogue chaired by Finance Minister Taro Aso, who also serves as deputy prime minister, and Vice President Mike Pence.
Japan hopes to use the dialogue to seek ways to avoid trade frictions on issues like autos and agriculture sectors by proposing an agenda focused on infrastructure investment and energy.
Japan's long-stagnant economy has shown signs of life in recent months, with exports and factory output benefiting from a global economic recovery. But consumer spending has remained sluggish.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 03:27PM ET</span>","U.S. housing, factory data underscore economy's resilience","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding jumped in February as unseasonably warm weather boosted the construction of single-family houses to near a 9-1/2-year high, suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite an apparent slowdown in the first quarter.
The economy's fundamentals were further strengthened by other data on Thursday showing a drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week amid a tightening labor market. Though factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled this month, manufacturers reported growth in new orders and difficulties finding qualified workers.
The data came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters that the U.S. central bank was sending a message that ""we have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks.""
""The reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the economy,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Housing starts increased 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.29 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. Homebuilding was up 6.2 percent compared to February 2016, suggesting housing would contribute to growth this year. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.5 percent to a 872,000-unit pace, the highest level since October 2007. 
Single-family starts in the Midwest soared 20 percent to their highest level since October 2007. Groundbreaking activity jumped more than 16 percent in the West and Northeast, but fell 2.6 percent in the South.
""Single-family homebuilding usually goes dormant throughout much of these regions during the winter months, but has held up better this year due to, up until recently, much milder winter weather,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 3.7 percent to a 416,000-unit pace. A robust labor market is supporting the housing market, helping it to buck weakness in other parts of the economy.
Further gains in single-family construction are likely as building permits increased 3.1 percent last month. A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence jumped in March to its highest level since June 2005.
The surge in confidence is, however, unlikely to translate into a homebuilding boom as builders continued to complain about rising material prices, higher mortgage rates, and shortages of lots and labor.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Fed's decision on Wednesday to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent. The U.S. central bank also forecast two more rate hikes this year.
The dollar (DXY) dropped to a one-month low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell as did stocks on Wall Street. 
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended March 11.
It was the 106th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with job growth averaging 209,000 per month over the past three months, and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November.
A third report from the Philadelphia Fed showed its manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 32.8 this month from 43.3 in February. However, the survey's new orders gauge hit its highest level since December 1987.
A measure of prices paid by factories for inputs raced to its highest level since May 2011. Factories also reported increasing prices for their goods, supporting the view that inflation pressures were building.
More than 60 percent of the firms in the mid-Atlantic said they were experiencing labor shortages and 68 percent reported skills mismatch between job openings and available labor. These percentages were higher compared to the last time companies were asked the same questions in May 2014.
Labor market strength and improvement in manufacturing are in stark contrast with a recent softening in consumer, construction and business spending. 

The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

Housing starts increased 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. January's starts were largely unrevised at a pace of 1.25 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.26 million units last month.
Homebuilding was up 6.2 percent compared to February 2016.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.5 percent to a pace of 872,000 units last month, the highest level since October 2007.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 3.7 percent to a pace of 416,000 units.
A robust labor market is supporting the housing market, helping it to buck weakness in other parts of the economy.
Consumer, construction and business spending softened in January while the trade deficit widened to a five-year high.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent and forecast two more rate hikes this year. That was the third rate hike since the 2008 financial crisis.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 0.9 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters on Wednesday that quarterly gross domestic product was ""noisy,"" and said policymakers had ""confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks.""
In February, permits for future home construction fell 6.2 percent to a rate of 1.21 million units. But single-family permits increased 3.1 percent to a pace of 832,000 units.
Building permits for multi-family units dropped 21.6 percent to a rate of 381,000 units. Single-family permits are likely to remain high. A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence jumped in March to its highest level since June 2005.
The surge in confidence is, however, unlikely to translate into a homebuilding boom as builders continued to complain about rising material prices, higher mortgage rates, and shortages of lots and labor.

LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - A Bank of England policymaker unexpectedly voted to raise interest rates this week and some among the majority who kept them at a record low felt it would not take much for them to follow suit, the BoE said.
Kristin Forbes, who is due to leave the British central bank in June, cast the sole vote in favor of raising Bank Rate to 0.5 percent, representing the first split on the Monetary Policy Committee since July of last year.
The other eight members of the MPC opted to keep rates at 0.25 percent, signaling no immediate hurry on the part of the BoE to emulate the U.S. Federal Reserve which raised interest rates on Wednesday for the third time since the global financial crisis.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected all nine MPC members to vote to keep rates unchanged.
The BoE expects Britain's economy to grow by a relatively strong 2.0 percent this year after withstanding the Brexit shock in 2016, but then to slow due to uncertainty about the country's exit from the European Union.
Most economists have predicted that the BoE will leave interest rates unchanged until 2019 at the earliest.
At their meeting this week, its policymakers mostly felt there were signs that consumers were turning more cautious as wage growth slowed and inflation rose, pushed up by the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound.
""Pay growth had remained subdued, consistent with the Committee's view that some slack remained in the labor market, and there had been some signs that the squeeze in households' real income growth was feeding through into spending, as expected,"" the Bank said in minutes of the March MPC meeting.
Data published on Wednesday showed annual pay growth slowing to 2.2 percent in the three months to January, heading in the opposite direction to the Bank's forecast of an increase to 3 percent in 2017 as a whole.
However, among the eight-strong majority, ""some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted,"" the minutes said.
The BoE's nine policymakers voted unanimously to make no changes to its bond-buying stimulus program, in line with the expectations in the Reuters poll.
The BoE said in February that some of its rate-setters had ""moved a little closer"" to their limits for tolerating an overshoot of the Bank's inflation target, caused by sterling's slide since June's Brexit vote.
Forbes, who is due to return to her career as a U.S. academic after leaving the BoE in June, had signaled she was getting uncomfortable with keeping rates on hold.
Thursday's minutes showed she felt measures of domestically generated inflation - and not just price pressure from the slump in the value of sterling since last June's Brexit vote - had increased notably and the expected post-referendum slowdown in the economy had not materialized.

Minutes from the central bank's policy meeting showed that eight members were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at the current record low of 0.25%.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>","Turkey central bank hikes liquidity window, but keeps other rates on hold","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank lifted its late liquidity window rate by 75 basis points on Thursday, taking more unorthodox tightening steps after a U.S. Federal Reserve hike, but left its main policy rate on hold ahead of a referendum next month.
The central bank has largely left its benchmark rate untouched, even as it has steadily tightened liquidity by other means, pushing borrowing costs to their highest in five years.
That unwillingness to raise the policy rate - even as the lira currency has hit a series of record lows - has stoked concerns it is under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, who has described himself as an ""enemy"" of interest rates and railed against the high cost of borrowing.
The bank raised the late liquidity window rate to 11.75 percent from 11 percent, less than the 100 basis point hike that had been predicted by 15 of 23 economists polled by Reuters.
However, it left its overnight lending rate at 9.25 percent, contrary to the expectations of a hike from nearly half the economists polled.
It also left its benchmark one-week repo rate at 8 percent. All but one respondent in the poll forecast it would be unchanged.
Turks will vote on April 16 in a referendum on constitutional changes sharply boosting the president's powers. Erdogan, who advocates growth through consumption, is keen to boost the flagging economy ahead of the referendum.

The lira firmed slightly following the central bank's move. It was at 3.6470 at 1118 GMT, some 0.8 percent firmer on the day.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 07:29AM ET</span>","China, following Fed, lifts short-term rates to steady yuan, battle debt","By John Ruwitch and Winni Zhou
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank raised short-term interest rates on Thursday in what economists said was a bid to stave off capital outflows and keep the yuan currency stable after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. rates overnight.
The increase in rates was China's third in as many months, and came a day after the end of the annual session of parliament where leaders warned that tackling risks from a rapid build-up in debt would be a top policy priority this year.
Hours earlier, the Fed raised its benchmark policy rate, as had been widely expected, and signaled more hikes were on the way as the U.S. economy picks up steam.
""The timing says it all. China is no longer insulated from the Fed and, more generally, from international financial conditions,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has left its benchmark lending rate unchanged since an October 2015 cut, and said specifically that Thursday's action should not be seen as full-blown policy tightening, like that of the Fed.
But analysts and investors believe the PBOC is increasingly using money market rates and other policy tools as it struggles to contain financial risks from years of debt-fueled stimulus and raise the costs for speculators betting against the yuan.
China's banks tend to rely heavily on short-term, interbank lending, which connect strong banks with weaker counterparts and shadowy lenders. The PBOC has been allowing repo rates to rise since late 2016 by adjusting the amount of funds it injects.
""The higher U.S. rates and tightening of U.S. monetary policy could trigger further capital outflows and have some negative impact on China's financial system,"" Nomura economist Yang Zhao said.
""I think they want to stabilize the currency at this time.""
The PBOC also strengthened the yuan's daily mid-point reference rate  by the most in about two months on Thursday. The yuan ended the day up 0.2 percent.
But benchmark 10-year treasury futures closed at their highest in over two months, as a big central bank cash injection calmed market jitters after the rate rises.
Last year the yuan  fell 6.5 percent against a resurgent dollar and uncertainty over China's economy, prompting the government to clamp down on capital outflows to ease a drain on its foreign exchange reserves.
The yuan has been largely stable this year as the dollar has paused, but China's government has remained alert as many market watchers expect the dollar will eventually resume its climb.
STRONGER ECONOMY GIVES POLICYMAKERS MORE ROOM
After years of super-loose policy, the PBOC has cautiously shifted to a modest tightening bias in recent months, though it is treading cautiously to avoid hurting growth. The economy is on steadier footing now, giving policymakers more room.
PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday that China's corporate debt levels are too high but stressed it will take time to bring them down to more manageable levels.
In keeping with that cautious approach, most of the increases on Thursday were a very modest 10 basis points (bps), or a tenth of a percentage point, the same as moves in various short- and mid-term policy instruments in January and February.
The rate on open market operation reverse repos for seven-, 14- and 28-day tenors was bumped up for the second time in six weeks, with the seven-day rising to 2.45 percent.
The PBOC insisted the moves did not indicate a change in its monetary policy, though some economists say the seven-day reverse repurchase rate has become a de facto policy rate.
Flexibility in rates is favorable for deleveraging, ""deflating bubbles"" and risk prevention, the PBOC said.
""(The market) does not need to over-interpret the amount and price of each operation,"" it said. ""Changes in rates are normal and do not indicate a change in direction for monetary policy.""
Economists expect further modest hikes in the seven-day rate over the course of the year, with ANZ expecting another 20 bps rise by year-end and London-based Capital Economics forecasting another 55 bps.
The weighted average rate for the seven-day reverse repo rose to 2.7641 percent, from Wednesday's 2.5697 percent.
CASH INJECTIONS TO CALM THE NERVES
The PBOC also raised the borrowing rate on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans, with the six-month rate now 3.05 percent and the one-year at 3.20 percent, after a similar move in late January. The MLF is a supplementary policy tool it uses to manage liquidity conditions in the banking system and money markets.
Completing the daily triple-play, sources said the PBOC also raised rates on its standing lending facility (SLF) short-term loans later in the day.
The rate increase for overnight SLF loans was twice that of the other instruments at 20 bps, possibly signaling concern that very short-term funding was still being used in riskier ways despite pledges of a crackdown. The PBOC had no immediate comment. 
The central bank also injected a large amount of fresh funds into the financial system to maintain liquidity.
It lent 113.5 billion yuan ($16.47 billion) of six-month MLF loans and 189.5 billion yuan of one-year MLF loans to 17 financial institutions on Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters earlier this year expected China would keep its benchmark lending rate steady through at least the second quarter of 2018.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said an uptick in inflation toward 1 percent won't immediately trigger an interest rate hike, signaling that Japan will stick to its ultra-easy policy even as other major economies eye withdrawing stimulus.
Kuroda, who heads to Germany for a Group of 20 finance leaders' meeting this weekend, also echoed calls from European policymakers to protect free trade in an apparent push-back to the protectionist streak of U.S. President Donald Trump.
""Not only the G20 but the IMF and OECD have said protectionism damages global trade and global economic growth, and that it is necessary to maintain free trade and investment,"" Kuroda told a news conference on Thursday.
""Japan's stance on this will not change.""
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its pledge to cap long-term interest rates around zero at a policy meeting earlier in the day.
The move was in stark contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision hours earlier to hike interest rates for the second time in three months in an effort to return policy to a more normal footing.
But Kuroda made clear the BOJ would not follow the Fed's footsteps any time soon, saying that Japan still needed massive monetary support with inflation distant from the bank's 2 percent target and risks to growth skewed to the downside.
He shrugged off market speculation the BOJ may raise its target on bond yields later this year, when consumer inflation is expected to approach 1 percent due mostly to a rebound in fuel costs and rising import prices from a weak yen.
""Some market participants believe core consumer inflation will approach 1 percent in the latter half of this year. That might very well happen. But we won't automatically raise our yield target just because this happens,"" Kuroda said.
Instead of looking at a single price data point, the BOJ will take into account various factors like the health of the economy and long-term inflation expectations, he said.
""The momentum for inflation to accelerate to 2 percent remains in place but lacks strength,"" Kuroda said. ""The BOJ will continue to promote powerful monetary easing ... to achieve its price target at the earliest date possible.""
The BOJ on Thursday maintained its short-term interest rate target of minus 0.1 and a pledge to guide the 10-year government bond yield at around zero percent.
It also kept intact a loose pledge to maintain the pace of its annual increase in Japanese government bond (JGBs) holdings, which is 80 trillion yen ($706 billion).
PROTECTIONISM A RISK
Japan's long-stagnant economy has shown signs of life in recent months, with exports and factory output benefiting from a recovery in global demand.
Core consumer prices rose for the first time in over a year in January and analysts expect them to continue to pick up slowly but steadily.
That has led to a dramatic shift in market expectations, with a majority of analysts polled by Reuters predicting the BOJ's next move would be to start scaling back its ultra-easy policy.
Some analysts say the BOJ may be forced to raise its yield target to avoid ramping up bond purchases if Japanese long-term interest rates track global bond yield rises, which are being driven by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates.
Kuroda rebuffed such a view, saying that he does not see the need to raise the yield target just because the Fed is doing so.
His latest comments may scale back market expectations of a near-term rate hike and embolden analysts who doubt the economy will gather enough steam for inflation to rise sustainably. 
""Very few people expect inflation to reach 2 percent. In addition, I see no change to inflation expectations,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""In these circumstances, raising the 10-year yield target cannot be considered. Even if the BOJ wanted to move, I don't think it could.""
A rising global tide of protectionism is adding to concerns for Japanese policymakers, given the economy's heavy reliance on exports and free trade.
Trump has accused Japan for using ""money supply"" to weaken the yen and give its exports an unfair trade advantage.
Kuroda stressed the BOJ's easing was aimed at beating deflation, and that interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States alone would not determine currency moves.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales recorded their smallest gain in six months in February amid delays in tax refunds, but the biggest rise in the annual inflation rate in nearly five years pointed to rising price pressures that could support further interest rate hikes.
The marginal increase in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was the latest sign the economy lost further momentum in the first quarter. Firming inflation and a tight labor market encouraged the Federal Reserve to raise rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months.
""Should inflation continue to firm and consumer spending remain solid, we expect the Fed will hike again in June, and at least three times this year,"" said Michael Hanson, chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month, the weakest reading since August, amid declines in purchases of automobiles and discretionary spending.
January's retail sales were, however, revised up to show a 0.6 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent advance. That left retail sales rising 5.7 percent in 12 months through February, underscoring the strength in domestic demand.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.1 percent after an upwardly revised 0.8 percent jump in January. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent in January.
The government delayed the issuing of tax refunds this year as part of efforts to combat fraud. 
""The later-than-usual processing of income tax refunds may have hampered consumer spending. However, the IRS has now caught up to last year's pace, and so spending could get a bump up in March,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Tightening labor market conditions, which are steadily lifting wages, continue to underpin consumer spending. Even with retail sales softening in February, domestic demand remains strong enough to generate more inflation in the economy. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index ticked up 0.1 percent last month as a drop in gasoline prices offset increases in the cost of food and rental accommodation. That was the weakest reading in the CPI since July and followed a 0.6 percent jump in January. 
In the 12 months through February, the CPI accelerated 2.7 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. The CPI rose 2.5 percent in the year to January. Inflation is firming in part as the 2015 drop, which was driven by lower oil prices, fades from the calculation. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month as new motor vehicle prices fell and apparel prices moderated after spiking in January. The core CPI increased 0.3 percent in January.
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI increased
2.2 percent after advancing 2.3 percent in January. It was the 15th straight month the year-on-year core CPI remained in the 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent range.
SLOWING GROWTH
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. The U.S. central bank raised its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent.
The Fed's policy-setting committee, however, did not flag any plan to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening this year, with officials sticking to their outlook for two more rate hikes. The Fed lifted rates once in 2016. 
The dollar fell to a two-week low against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rallied. Stocks on Wall Street rose to session highs.
February's retail sales added to January's weak reports on trade, construction and business spending in suggesting sluggish economic growth in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 0.9 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. 
With the labor market near full employment, slowing growth probably understates the health of the economy and GDP tends to be weaker in the first quarter because of calculation issues that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve.
In February, motor vehicle sales fell 0.2 percent and receipts at service stations slipped 0.6 percent, reflecting lower gasoline prices. Americans also cut back on dining out and spent less on hobbies and sporting goods. 
Sales at electronics and appliances recorded their biggest decline since December 2011. Sales at clothing stores saw their largest drop in nearly a year. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) and Macy's Inc (N:M) are scaling back on brick-and-mortar operations amid increased competition from online retailers, led by Amazon.com (O:AMZN).

Online retail sales jumped 1.2 percent last month. Receipts at building material stores increased 1.8 percent.

1680,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 02:12PM ET</span>",Fed raises rates by 0.25%; dollar slumps,"Investing.com – The Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by 0.25% to a 0.75%-1% range on Wednesday.
The Federal Reserve struck a familiar tone in its statement, pointing out that interest rate increases “will be gradual” in 2017, and maintained its view of three rate hikes, with the remaining two rate hikes expected later this year. 
The Fed opted for a somewhat softer outlook concerning GDP gains as it left 2017 and 2019 forecasts of GDP unchanged at 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively, but its 2018 GDP forecast was increased by 0.1% to 2.1%.
Following the release of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision to increase rates by 0.25% to a 0.75%-1% range, the dollar slumped while gold prices rose to new highs for the session.
The interest rate hike was widely expected by market participants, after investing.com's fed rate monitor spiked to its highest level.
The U.S. dollar index slumped 0.87% to trade at 100.74.
Gold futures rose $10.3, or 0.80% to $1210, while Treasury yields fell 3.09% with the U.S. 10-Year trading at around 2.517 by 14:08 EDT.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's exports rose in February for the sixth straight month, helped by a pick-up in engineering sales despite fears of protectionist and anti-trade sentiment in the United States and Europe.
Merchandise exports <INEXP=ECI> grew 17.48 percent year-on-year to $24.49 billion last month while imports <INIMP=ECI> rose 21.76 percent to $33.39 billion, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement.
Ahead of the G20 finance ministers meeting this week in Germany, the International Monetary Fund has called on the Group of 20 major economies, including India, to work together to preserve the benefits of trade and avoid protectionism.
India, the world's third-largest steel producer, has also raised import tax on steel and set a floor price to protect local mills - a measure challenged by Japan.
Japan has asked the World Trade Organization to set up a dispute settlement panel to examine India's duties on steel imports which it says are violating WTO rules.
India's foreign trade deficit <INTRD=ECI> narrowed to $8.9 billion in February from a provisional $9.84 billion the previous month, government data showed on Wednesday.
The deficit fell nearly $20 billion in 2015/16 as the cost of oil imports halved thanked to a slide in prices, a trade windfall to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
India exported $245.4 billion of goods in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year ending in March, up 2.5 percent from a year ago, while imports fell 3.7 percent during the same period to $340.7 billion, leaving a deficit of $95.3 billion.
Iron and steel imports declined 14.2 percent in February to $6.3 billion from a year ago, while engineering products exports grew 47.3 percent to $6.6 billion in the same period.
Indian lawmakers have suggested to the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to introduce tariff barriers on raw materials for a broad range of products in addition to duties on steel imports.
Officially, India has not set a target for exports in 2016/17, underlining the uncertain global outlook and fears of rising U.S. protectionism.
The IMF, however, expects that India's merchandise exports next fiscal year could grow near 10 percent to $301 billion while imports could grow 11.3 percent to near $454 billion.
The Fund expects India to remain one of the fastest growing emerging market economies - likely to grow at 6.6 percent in the current fiscal year ending March and 7.2 percent next fiscal.

The Commerce Department said that consumer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, meeting forecasts and following a gain of 0.6% in January.
Year-over-year, consumer prices were 2.7% higher from the same month a year earlier, in line with expectations and after rising 2.5% in the preceding month.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, matching forecasts. Core consumer prices rose 0.3% in January.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.2% last month, also meeting expectations.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
USD/JPY was at 114.74 from around 114.60 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0623 from 1.0630 earlier, while GBP/USD was at 1.2200 from 1.2202.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 0.1% in February from the prior month, in line with forecasts. January retail sales increased 0.6%, whose figure was revised from an initial 0.4% rise.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in February, in line with consensus expectations. Core sales in the prior month were revised to a 1.2% advance from the prior 0.8% gain.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 07:22AM ET</span>",UK wage growth weakens but jobless rate lowest since 2005,"By Andy Bruce and John Geddie
LONDON (Reuters) - Inflation gnawed away at British pay growth in the three months to January, an unpromising sign for the economy ahead of its divorce from the European Union even as the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 2005.
The official data painted a familiar picture of solid job growth but weak increases in income that have put a strain on many households since the financial crisis.
Pay growth, adjusted for inflation, halved to just 0.7 percent, the lowest since October 2014, which was shortly before inflation plunged to just below zero and made it easier for households to cope with slow pay growth.
But inflation is now rising again quickly, pushed up by the post-Brexit vote slump in the value of the pound. In January alone inflation-adjusted pay growth contracted by 0.2 percent, the first shrinkage since August 2014, the Office for National Statistics said. 
The outlook for consumer spending is critical for Britain's economy as it begins the process of leaving the EU. Consumers kept up their spending after June's Brexit referendum shock but there have been signs that they are turning more wary.
The weakness in pay growth is likely to reassure the Bank of England that it should keep borrowing costs at their record low for longer, despite the pick-up in headline inflation.
The BoE, which is due to announce its interest rate decision for March on Thursday, is watching closely for any signs that rising inflation is feeding through into pay pressure.
Wednesday's data showed growth in pay including bonuses slipped to 2.2 percent in the three months to January, the weakest since the three months to April last year and worse than forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
ZERO-HOURS
""All told, the combination of meager wage growth despite very low unemployment supports the Monetary Policy Committee's view that enough slack remains in the labor market to warrant keeping rates on hold during the imminent period of high inflation,"" said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Sterling fell back below $1.22, halving the day's gains, and government bond prices rose as investors homed in on the implications of the weak wage growth figures for the BoE.
While the pay outlook is weak, Britain's labor market remains strong despite the shock of last year's Brexit vote.
The jobless rate fell to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent, marking its lowest level since the summer of 2005, the ONS said. 
The ONS said the unemployment rate was last lower in 1975. Economists polled by Reuters had expected no change in the rate.
The BoE has said it expects unemployment could fall as low as 4.5 percent before it starts to push up inflation.
The employment rate hit a record high.
Economists have said they largely expect unemployment to rise this year as companies hold off from hiring while they wait for more clarity on the country's future ties to the EU.
The BoE said last month it expected a jobless rate of 5.0 percent in a year's time, although that was lower than its previous forecast of 5.5 percent.
While rising employment has been one of Britain's economic success stories over the last few years, new figures from the ONS showed almost a million people in work were on zero-hours contracts - jobs with no guarantee of work.

The number of workers on these contracts rose to 905,000 in the three months to December, up by 101,000 in the space of a year and representing almost 3 percent of people in employment.
