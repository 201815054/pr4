27,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2014 12:32AM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate unchanged at 2.5%,"Investing.com - Following is the full test statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia's Tuesday board meeting to review monetary policy.
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision:
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.
Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace, helped by firmer conditions in the advanced countries. China's growth slowed a little earlier in the year but remains generally in line with policymakers' objectives. Commodity prices in historical terms remain high, but some of those important to Australia have declined.
Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain low. Emerging market economies are once again receiving capital inflows. Volatility in many financial prices is currently unusually low. Markets appear to be attaching a very low probability to any rise in global interest rates over the period ahead.
In Australia, recent data indicate somewhat firmer growth around the turn of the year, but this resulted mainly from very strong increases in resource exports as new capacity came on stream; smaller increases in such exports are likely in coming quarters. Moderate growth has been occurring in consumer demand. A strong expansion in housing construction is now under way. At the same time, resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly. Signs of improvement in investment intentions in some other sectors are emerging, but these plans remain tentative as firms wait for more evidence of improved conditions before committing to significant expansion. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend over the year ahead.
There has been some improvement in indicators for the labour market in recent months, but it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Growth in wages has declined noticeably. If these and other domestic costs remain contained, inflation should remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with lower levels of the exchange rate.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and for some borrowers have edged lower over recent months. Savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth has picked up a little, including most recently to businesses. Dwelling prices have increased significantly over the past year, though there have been some signs of a moderation in the pace of increase recently. The exchange rate remains high by historical standards, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices, and hence is offering less assistance than it might in achieving balanced growth in the economy.
Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.
In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

141,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2014 02:09PM ET</span>","Fed leaves rates unchanged, trims easing program by $10 billion","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% but said it would cut its monthly bond-buying program to $35 billion from $45 billion.
The Fed pointed out that economic activity has rebounded and added the labor market continued to strengthen, though monetary authorities still see room for more improvement.
""Labor market indicators generally showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated,"" the Fed said in its statement.
""Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.""
Fiscal policy continues to dampen economic growth, although the extent of that restraint is diminishing, the Fed added, while consumer prices remain in comfort zones.
""Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.""
The U.S. central bank said highly accommodative policy remains appropriate to keep recovery on track and added additional stimulus tapering is likely if inflation rates and the labor market continue to improve.
When determining how long benchmark interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels, monetary authorities will pay close attention to both real and anticipated progress needed to reach maximum employment and 2% inflation, including labor market conditions, inflationary pressures, inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.
While investors expect some time to pass between when the Fed closes its stimulus program and when it first hikes interest rates, they should not expect that time to pass too quickly, as the Fed wants to be sure the economy can stand on its own two feet before tightening.
""The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,"" the Fed said.
""The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.""
The announcement came as little surprise to markets.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.11% at 80.62.

Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

212,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2014 06:42PM ET</span>",TEXT - Reserve Bank of New Zealand hikes OCR to 3.25%,"Investing.com - Following is the full text statement of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's decision on Thursday to raise the Official Cash Rate 25 basis points to 3.25%.
Statement issued by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today increased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.
New Zealand’s economic expansion has considerable momentum, with GDP estimated to have grown by around 4 percent in the year to June. Global financial conditions remain very accommodative and are reflected in low long-term interest rates and narrow risk spreads. Economic growth among New Zealand’s trading partners is gradually improving and global inflation remains low.
Prices for New Zealand’s export commodities remain historically high, but their recent falls will reduce farm incomes over the coming year. A continued acceleration in construction in Canterbury, and more broadly, is supporting growth, together with strong net immigration flows that are adding to housing and household demand. Business and consumer confidence remains buoyant, as do businesses’ reported intentions to invest and to hire.
While house price inflation remains high, the housing market has moderated since late last year when restrictions were applied to high loan-to-value ratio mortgage lending and when mortgage interest rates began rising. Fiscal consolidation continues to moderate demand growth, though by less than previously assumed. The exchange rate has not yet adjusted to weakening commodity prices, but is expected to do so. The Bank does not believe the exchange rate is sustainable at current levels.
Headline inflation remains moderate and tradables inflation is expected to be low for some time. However, above-trend growth has been absorbing spare capacity and adding pressure to non-tradables inflation. These pressures are particularly evident in construction cost increases. Nevertheless, overall wage inflation remains moderate, reflecting recent low headline inflation, increased labour force participation and strong net immigration.
Inflationary pressures are expected to increase. In this environment, it is important that inflation expectations remain contained and that interest rates return to a more neutral level. The speed and extent to which the OCR will need to rise will depend on future economic and financial data, and its implications for inflationary pressures.
By increasing the OCR as needed to keep future average inflation near the 2 percent target mid-point, the Bank is seeking to ensure that the economic expansion can be sustained.

“In May, the trend in housing starts was virtually unchanged for the third consecutive month. This is in line with CMHC’s analysis indicating that the new home construction market in Canada is headed for a soft landing in 2014,” said Bruno Duhamel, Manager, Housing and Economic Analysis.
“Builders are expected to continue to manage their starts activity in order to ensure that demand from buyers seeking new units is first channeled toward unsold completed units or unsold units that are currently under construction, including condominium units.”

The Fed is currently purchasing $45 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery, a monetary policy tool known as quantitative easing that suppresses long-term interest rates, weakening the dollar while boosting stock prices in the process in hopes investing and hiring will follow suit.
The Fed's current asset-purchasing plan kicked off at $85 billion in 2012, though further tapering will be likely as the economy stands on its own two feet.
Monetary authorities agreed at their April meeting to seek out a mix of tools to normalize monetary policy once the bond-buying program ends, though the U.S. central bank didn't spell out exactly when benchmark interest-rate hikes would begin.
""Participants generally agreed that starting to consider the options for normalization at this meeting was prudent, as it would help the Committee to make decisions about approaches to policy normalization and to communicate its plans to the public well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate,"" the minutes from the Fed's April 29-30 meeting read.
""Early communication, in turn, would enhance the clarity and credibility of monetary policy and help promote the achievement of the Committee's statutory objectives.""
The Fed also added that stimulus programs have not fueled inflationary pressures as of now, which gives monetary authorities flexibility to manage the economy that would spur job creation without escalating consumer prices.
""It was also noted that because inflation was expected to remain well below the Committee's 2 percent objective and the unemployment rate was still above participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the Committee did not, at present, face a tradeoff between its employment and inflation objectives, and an expansion of aggregate demand would result in further progress relative to both objectives,"" the minutes read.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.16% at 80.22.
The Dow 30 was up 0.88% at 16,519.00.

462,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2014 01:44PM ET</span>",Fed's Dudley: Rate hikes will take place gradually,"The Federal Reserve will hike interest rates someday but don't expect monetary policy to tighten too quickly, William Dudley, the Fed's Bank of New York President, said on Tuesday.
The Fed is currently purchasing $45 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery by suppressing long-term interest rates, a monetary policy tool known as quantitative easing.
Monetary authorities have said a considerable amount of time will pass after the quantitative easing program ends and rate hikes begin, though markets can expect a very gradual tightening.
Markets have long been concerned of the inflationary sides effects that stem from past and present quantitative easing programs and how the Fed can rein them in as the economy improves.
""My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow. This depends, however, in large part, not only on the economy’s performance, but also on how financial conditions respond to tightening,"" Dudley said in prepared remarks of a speech he delivered before the New York Association for Business Economics earlier.
""If the response of financial conditions to tightening is very mild—say similar to how the bond and equity markets have responded to the tapering of asset purchases since last December—this might encourage a somewhat faster pace. In contrast, if bond yields were to move sharply higher, as was the case last spring, then a more cautious approach might be warranted.""
The Fed's current bond-buying program began in 2012 at $85 billion in monthly asset purchases, though a stronger economy has prompted the Fed to taper the program.
Past and present rounds of asset purchases have swelled the Fed's balance sheet to around $4 trillion today, though the Fed will shrink that figure as gently as possible.
""With an exceptionally large balance sheet there will be considerable attention on the methods that the FOMC will likely use in order to exert control over the level of short-term rates. I can’t tell you yet how we will do it, but I am fully confident that we have the necessary tools to control the level of short-term rates and the credit creation process,"" Dudley said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy body.
Dudley added that the Fed's 2% inflation goal is not a ceiling and added policy will remain flexible.
""My own view is that 2 percent is definitely not a ceiling. Once we reach 2 percent, I would expect that we would spend as much time slightly above 2 percent as below it, recognizing that we will hardly ever be exactly at 2 percent because of the inherent volatility in prices,"" Dudley said.
""If inflation were to drift above 2 percent, all else equal, then we would tend to resist such a rise. But, if inflation were slightly above 2 percent even as unemployment remained far above levels consistent with maximum employment, then the unemployment consideration would dominate because we would be further from the unemployment objective than we are from the inflation objective. This should not surprise anyone. This is what our 'balanced approach' implies.""

463,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2014 01:11PM ET</span>","Fed's Plosser: Taper pace may need to speed up, rate hikes as well","The Federal Reserve should consider winding down its monthly bond-purchasing program quicker than its current pace to ensure than inflationary pressures remain in comfort zones, Charles Plosser, the head of the Federal Reserve's Bank of Philadelphia, said Tuesday.
The Federal Reserve has said that rate hikes won't come for a considerable time period after the Fed's bond-purchasing program ends, but monetary authorities may want to pay close attention to that time frame, Plosser added.
The Fed is currently purchasing $45 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery by suppressing long-term interest rates.
That figure is down from the original $85 billion in monthly bond purchases begun in 2012, as a stronger economy has prompted the Fed to taper the program.
Should the U.S. economy improve as forecast, monetary authorities should taper the program quickly as inflation rates approach Fed target levels, Plosser said, adding once the program winds down, rate hikes should follow close behind.
""My own view is that, as we continue to move closer to our 2 percent inflation goal and the labor market improves, we must be prepared to adjust policy appropriately. That may well require us to begin raising interest rates sooner rather than later,"" Plosser said in prepared remarks of a speech he delivered in Washington earlier.
""On monetary policy, reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to FOMC forecasts.""
The economy is improving and will continue to need less monetary support going forward, though don't expect a boom in the housing sector.
""I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace. We are likely to see growth return to around 3 percent through the rest of 2014. Prospects for labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014,"" Plosser said.
""I also believe that inflation expectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the next year. I expect the housing and construction sectors will continue to recover. But we should not seek to return to the heady days of last decade's real estate boom.""

Members Present
Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna.
Members granted leave of absence to John Akehurst in terms of section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959.
Others Present
Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic Conditions.
Members were briefed that the staff forecast for growth of Australia's major trading partners was little changed since the February Statement on Monetary Policy, with growth in 2014 and 2015 still expected to be around its long-run average pace. They noted that the slight moderation in growth of Australia's major trading partners in the March quarter was expected to be temporary.
In China, GDP growth and other indicators of activity eased a little in early 2014; however, in year-ended terms, growth was still consistent with the government's annual target of 7½ per cent. There were some signs that the recent slowing could be temporary, with real fixed asset investment growing at a similar pace to recent quarters and the authorities indicating a willingness to support investment growth, if needed, to achieve the target for output growth. Members also noted that the flow of new total social financing had remained lower than over most of 2013, consistent with the authorities' efforts to place financing on a more sustainable footing.
Chinese steel prices remained below the average of recent years, notwithstanding a slight increase over the past month. Lower steel prices were consistent with some easing in Chinese steel demand, as well as some apparent tightening in credit conditions for steel production and the use of iron ore as collateral for borrowing.
In Japan, economic activity appeared to have increased strongly in the March quarter, prior to the increase in the consumption tax in April, but recent surveys had pointed to a subsequent decline in business conditions. It remained uncertain whether the planned fiscal stimulus measures would offset the expected decline in household expenditure following the consumption tax increase. After rising earlier, consumer price inflation had stabilised in recent months, but early indicators confirmed that April would see a sharp, temporary rise in inflation in response to the tax increase.
In the rest of east Asia, output growth appeared to have been around its decade-average pace and exports had been growing at a similar rate to recent years.
The US economy was showing signs of moderate growth. While the economy recorded negligible GDP growth in the March quarter, primarily because of the effect of adverse weather, more recent monthly indicators had been consistent with further economic recovery. Members noted, in particular, that the labour market had continued to improve, with a large increase in non-farm payrolls recorded in April. Over the past six months, non-farm payrolls employment had increased at a touch above the average pace of the past few years and the participation rate had increased a little.
Economic activity in the euro area was picking up gradually, although spare capacity remained substantial. Members observed that inflation had declined further over recent months to rates that were below the European Central Bank's target in all countries. This remained a concern for policymakers, even though price declines in some of the periphery economies had helped to improve their competitiveness.Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that the inflation outcome for the March quarter was a little lower than most analysts had expected, following a surprisingly high outcome for the December quarter. The recent pattern of quarterly inflation appeared to overstate the changes in inflationary pressures and, in year-ended terms, underlying inflation in the March quarter was around 2½–2¾ per cent. Year-ended CPI inflation was slightly higher, at 2.9 per cent, with a little under ¼ percentage point due to the rise in the tobacco excise in December.
Over the past year as a whole, the increase in tradables prices was broadly consistent with the depreciation of the exchange rate over that period. Year-ended inflation in non-tradables prices had slowed to around 3 per cent, noticeably lower than the average of around 4 per cent over the past decade. This slowing had been influenced by the decline in wage growth over the preceding year or so and was more evident in the prices of market services, for which labour costs were a key determinant of prices.
Labour market conditions had shown some signs of improvement for a number of months, following the pick-up in economic activity from late 2013. The unemployment rate declined a little in March, although members noted that monthly movements in labour market data could be volatile. The participation rate appeared to have stabilised and employment growth had strengthened in recent months. Forward-looking indicators had also improved, but remained at low levels and were consistent with relatively moderate employment growth in coming months.
Overall, the pace of economic activity had increased over the previous six months, with the economy looking to have grown at around its long-run average pace in the March quarter, driven by especially strong growth of exports. With this pace of export growth unlikely to be sustained, output growth was expected to be somewhat slower over the next few quarters.
Following strong growth at the beginning of the year, retail sales growth appeared to have moderated somewhat more recently. Low interest rates and rising housing prices continued to support household consumption and, notwithstanding recent volatility, measures of consumer sentiment remained around long-run average levels.
The housing market continued to be an area of strength in the economy. Although the most recent data had indicated a decline, dwelling approvals remained at high levels and the flow-on to commencements pointed to strong growth in dwelling investment in the first half of 2014. Across Australia, housing price inflation had eased somewhat in recent months from the earlier rapid pace, with auction clearance rates edging back and housing loan approvals stabilising. Other indicators, such as turnover, first home owner grants and loan approvals for new housing, remained consistent with strong demand for both established and new housing.
The volume of iron ore and coal exports had risen strongly over recent months. Additional capacity for these commodities was still coming on line, although exports were expected to grow at a slower rate than in 2013.
Survey measures of business conditions that had become available over the previous month had been mixed, but a number of surveys suggested that business sentiment remained around average levels after increasing from the lows in the middle of 2013. Notwithstanding the decline in non-residential building approvals over recent months, the stock of work to be done was at a high level, suggesting that business investment in construction could pick up.
Members discussed the staff forecasts for the domestic economy, noting that average GDP growth over the forecast period was little changed from the February Statement on Monetary Policy. Over 2014/15, GDP growth was expected to be a bit below trend, with the effects of monetary stimulus partly offset by the downturn in mining investment and planned fiscal consolidation. Growth was subsequently expected to pick up to an above-trend pace over 2015/16, with both non-mining business investment and LNG exports forecast to contribute to growth. Although employment growth was anticipated to strengthen, this was not likely to exceed population growth consistently for some time as the improvement in the labour market was expected to be relatively protracted.
Members observed that the forecast for underlying inflation had been little changed and that underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period. This outlook reflected the effect of two opposing influences. Domestic inflationary pressures were likely to remain subdued, reflecting spare capacity in labour and product markets weighing on labour costs and profit margins for some time. Working in the other direction, with the exchange rate remaining lower than a year earlier, higher import prices were expected to exert an upward influence on inflation for several years, albeit by a bit less than had been anticipated a few months earlier.Financial Markets
Members opened their discussion of financial markets with the observation that the past month had been largely uneventful, with little change in government bond yields and share prices in the major economies and stability in most exchange rates. Volatility in many asset classes was at multi-year lows.
At its April meeting, the US Federal Reserve had continued the process of scaling back its asset purchases, reducing monthly purchases by a further US$10 billion to US$45 billion. The Fed reiterated that it expected the federal funds rate to remain unchanged for a ‘considerable period’ after asset purchases were anticipated to end later this year, and financial markets continued to expect the first increase in the policy rate to occur around mid 2015. The European Central Bank also kept policy unchanged at its meeting in early April, as well as indicating a preparedness to use additional measures – asset purchases and a negative deposit rate – if the medium-term outlook for inflation subsequently softened or financial conditions tightened. The Bank of Japan left its rate of asset purchases unchanged during April and was now buying more assets each month than the Fed, while also foreshadowing another increase in purchases if necessary to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target.
While government bond yields in the major markets were little changed over the past month, yields on government bonds in euro area periphery countries had fallen further to multi-year lows. Greece had raised €3 billion of five-year debt. This was Greece's first issuance of long-term debt in four years and the issue was around seven times oversubscribed. Emerging market government bond yields generally fell over April, as capital flows to these countries resumed. In Australia, government bond yields also declined over the past month, partly in response to the lower-than-expected inflation data.
Members noted that credit market conditions were very favourable in most markets, with corporate spreads in Australia approaching pre-crisis levels. In the case of recent issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in Australia, several securities involved mortgages written by non-bank originators.
Equity prices in advanced economies, including Australia, had been a little higher over the past month, whereas equity prices in most emerging markets had increased strongly, with Russia a notable exception.
Members observed that the major currencies had changed little over April, with volatility at multi-year lows. The Australian dollar had also shown little change over the past month and remained around 6 per cent higher in trade-weighted terms than in late January, although it was still around 10 per cent lower than a year earlier. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated further, to be around 5 per cent lower in trade-weighted terms than earlier in the year. Chinese foreign exchange reserves recorded another strong rise in the March quarter.
The funding composition of Australian banks had changed little over recent months, though members noted a switch from term deposits to at-call deposit accounts. Secondary market spreads on covered and other bonds issued by the major banks had also changed little in April, and these remained around their lowest levels since 2007/08. The marginal cost of new wholesale debt issuance by the major banks declined over the month and remained relatively low, while the average outstanding spread was broadly unchanged.
Members noted that money market rates in Australia continued to imply that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting and over the rest of the year.Considerations for Monetary Policy
Members noted that there had been little change in the outlook for the global economy, with growth of Australia's major trading partners in the year ahead still forecast to be around average. The latest data received on the domestic economy had evolved much as expected, with further indications that growth had picked up a little over the past two quarters. This had been driven by very strong exports as well as an increase in the growth of consumption and dwelling investment. However, the Board noted that overall growth in coming quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the planned fiscal consolidation.
While a range of indicators suggested that conditions in the labour market had improved in recent months, the demand for labour remained subdued and was likely to remain so for some time. This had led to lower wage growth, which in turn had seen inflation decline for non-tradable items whose prices were more sensitive to labour costs. This was being offset by stronger inflation for tradable items as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate over the previous year. Inflation was consistent with the target and was forecast to remain so over the next couple of years.
At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. The expansionary setting of monetary policy continued to have the expected effects on economic activity. Notably, a sustained increase in dwelling investment was in prospect, consumption had strengthened a little and business conditions were around average levels. Recent developments had indicated that the economy had evolved broadly in line with earlier expectations, resulting in little change in the updated forecasts for activity and inflation. With growth in activity expected to pick up only gradually, and spare capacity in the labour market consequently remaining for some time, growth in domestic costs was forecast to remain contained, which would help to offset the ongoing effect on prices from the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year. Given this outlook for the economy and the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic activity, the Board considered that the current accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for some time yet.The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

The Bank of Japan board minutes noted some members said the current recovery is exerting more upward pressure on prices than it is boosting economic growth.
""A few members expressed the recognition that developments in wages tended to have a more significant effect on overall prices, as Japan's industrialstructure had been shifting to one led mainly by non-manufacturing,"" the minutes said.
One member said that wage increases and price rises resulting from supply-side constrains might not be enough to bring 2% sustained inflation by 2015.
At the April 7-8 meeting, the BOJ board decided by a unanimous vote to leave the bank's policy target unchanged.

625,By International Business Times,"<span>May 06, 2014 07:45AM ET</span>",Eurozone Businesses Surge In Q2,"By Reuters - Euro zone businesses had a solid start to the second quarter of the year with activity picking up at its fastest pace in almost three years, surveys showed on Tuesday, suggesting a broad-based recovery is taking hold in the bloc.
While Germany continued to lead the upturn, businesses in Spain and Ireland grew at their fastest pace since before the financial crisis.
Survey compiler Markit said the Composite Purchasing Managers' Index pointed to second-quarter growth of 0.5 percent, which would be the strongest in three years.
The data will come as a relief to the European Central Bank, which has so far shrugged off calls for extra stimulus through another interest rate cut or outright asset purchases.
The ECB is expected to keep its key policy rates on hold when it meets next week, according to economists polled by Reuters, who also said euro zone inflation had fallen as far as it would go at 0.5 percent in March.
The Composite PMI, widely seen as a good gauge of growth, rose to 54.0 in April, as expected by economists, from March's 53.1. It has held above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction for 10 months in a row.
Burgeoning new orders provided the boost, with the related sub-index rising to a 35-month high of 52.7 in April, while firms took on staff at the fastest pace since September 2011.
""The final PMI confirms ... the euro zone started the second quarter with the fastest growth seen for three years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. ""The most exciting news is the strong upturns that are becoming apparent in Spain and Ireland, where the rates of growth rose to the fastest for seven and eight years respectively.""
Price rises remained muted, although the survey showed a slight acceleration in input cost rises which, coupled with the accelerating recovery, may ease concerns about disinflation.
The index for the euro zone's vast service industry rose to a 34-month high of 53.1 in April from 52.2 in March thanks to a surge in new business to its highest since June 2011 and a slight rise in employment. Services business activity in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Spain all grew together for the first time since May 2011.

633,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2014 12:31AM ET</span>",TEXT - Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate unchanged at 2.5%,"Investing.com - The following is the full text statement released Tuesday of the Reserve Bank of Australia's May cash rate review.
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.
Growth in the global economy was a bit below trend in 2013, but there are reasonable prospects of a better outcome this year, helped by firmer conditions in the advanced countries. China's growth appears to have slowed a little in early 2014 but remains generally in line with policymakers' objectives. Commodity prices in historical terms remain high, though some of those important to Australia have softened further of late.
Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and most risk spreads remain low. Equity and credit markets are well placed to provide adequate funding.
In Australia, the economy grew at a below-trend pace in 2013. Recent information suggests moderate growth is occurring in consumer demand and foreshadows a strong expansion in housing construction. Some indicators of business conditions and confidence have improved from a year ago and exports are rising. But at the same time, resources sector investment spending is set to decline significantly and, at this stage, signs of improvement in investment intentions in other sectors are only tentative, as firms wait for more evidence of improved conditions before committing to expansion plans. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued.
The demand for labour has been weak over the past year and, as a result, the rate of unemployment has risen somewhat. More recently, there has been some improvement in indicators for the labour market, but it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Growth in wages has declined noticeably and this has been reflected more clearly in the latest price data, which show a moderation in growth in prices for non-traded goods and services. As a result, inflation is consistent with the target. If domestic costs remain contained, that should continue to be the case over the next one to two years, even with lower levels of the exchange rate.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth has picked up a little, while dwelling prices have increased significantly over the past year. The decline in the exchange rate from its highs a year ago will assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, but less so than previously as a result of the rise over the past few months. The exchange rate remains high by historical standards.
Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand, and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.
In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates."

""The Bank of Russia does not intend to lower the key rate in the coming months,"" the bank said in an accompanying statement.   The central bank had been expected to keep rates on hold this month, having raised its key rate by 150 bps in March in response to financial instability linked to the political crisis in Ukraine. 
The March hike came after Russian President Vladimir Putin received parliamentary authorisation to use military force in Ukraine prior to its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.   Russia launched army drills near the Ukrainian border on Thursday after Ukrainian forces killed five pro-Moscow rebels.   The central bank said its decision on Friday was due to inflationary risks linked to the weakening rouble.   ""The probability of inflation exceeding the 5.0 percent target at the end of 2014 has increased substantially. This has been caused by more pronounced than expected pass-through effect of the exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices,"" it said.   The bank added that inflation stood at 7.2 percent on April 21. Although the bank is formally allowed to deviate by 1.5 percentage points either side of its 5 percent, it has forecast inflation at between 5 and 6 percent by year-end.   On Friday, it said inflation was likely to end the year at the upper end of that range.   ""The Bank of Russia estimates that the adopted decision (on the key rate) would ensure the decline in inflation to no more than 6.0 percent by the end of 2014,"" it said in its statement.   The surprise rate hike comes despite a severe economic slowdown which saw Russia's economy grow by only 0.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter.   ""The current economic slowdown is predominantly structural by nature and thus does not exert any noticeable downward pressure on inflation,"" the bank said.   The rouble strengthened immediately after the decision, but then weakened towards its levels before the rate hike.   At 1015 GMT the rouble was at 35.96 against the dollar , down 0.5 percent on the day.

781,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 22, 2014 11:15PM ET</span>",Chinese Industrial Activity Still Shrinking,"By Reuters - BEIJING - China's factory activity shrank for the fourth straight month in April, signaling economic weakness into the second quarter, a preliminary survey showed Wednesday. But the pace of decline eased, helped by policy steps to arrest the slowdown.
Analysts see initial signs of stabilization in the economy due to the government's targeted measures to underpin growth, but believe more policy support may be needed as structural reforms put additional pressures on activity.

The HSBC/Markit flash Purchasing Managers Index for April rose to 48.3 from March's final reading of 48.0, still below the 50 line separating expansion from contraction.
""It's generally in line (with expectations), reflecting that the growth momentum is stabilizing,"" said Zhou Hao, China economist at ANZ in Shanghai, who expected economic growth to pick up slightly to 7.5 percent in the second quarter.
Annual growth in China's economy slowed to 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, its slowest pace in 18 months, but the pace was just ahead of market expectations and seemed to soothe fears of a sharp downturn.
China's central bank will cut the amount of deposits rural banks must hold as reserves by between 0.5 and 2 percentage points, it said Tuesday, the latest in a series of measures to help revive a slowing economy.
CICC estimated that the reserve cut could release 110 billion yuan ($17.64 billion) of bank liquidity, while Nomura put the amount at 80 billion-90 billion yuan, which was small given the size of the economy.
Many economists still expect a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for all banks later this year, as protracted economic weakness fuels capital outflows, raising the pressure on the central bank to pump more liquidity into the economy.
The government has already unveiled steps to quicken construction of railways, build more affordable housing for the poor, and cut taxes for small firms to underpin growth.
Signs of a slowdown in the first quarter had been evident in a series of economic indicators, prompting the government to unveil a series of measures to promote growth, although it has ruled out major stimulus.
It has also said that its main focus will be on job creation, and that it did not matter if growth in 2014 came in a little below the official target of 7.5 percent.
The survey showed contractions in new orders and output moderated somewhat, though new export orders slipped back below the 50 line after a pick-up in March, suggesting that the external environment remains difficult for Chinese firms.
""Domestic demand showed mild improvement and deflationary pressures eased, but downside risks to growth are still evident as both new export orders and employment contracted,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC, in a statement accompanying the PMI.
He added that he expected more government support measures in coming months, which was echoed by ANZ's Zhou, who believed policy support would be targeted and measured.
Analysts believe that China's property market could threaten Beijing's plan to manage a slowdown in growth, as evidence mounts of a rapid cooling in what had been one of the few strong spots in the world's second-largest economy.

792,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 21, 2014 07:00AM ET</span>",Japanese Export Growth Slows Sharply,"By Reuters - Japan's annual export growth slowed sharply in March due to weaker shipments to China, casting doubt that a recovery in external demand could help offset the impact of the April 1 sales tax hike.
Ministry of Finance data showed that exports rose 1.8 percent in March from a year earlier, following a 9.8 percent annual gain in the previous month. That was well below a 6.3 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll.

The weak external shipments helped push Japan's trade deficit to a record 13.75 trillion yen ($134.45 billion) for the fiscal year that ended in March.
The latest data joins a recent string of soft economic reports including capital spending and private consumption, which have kept alive expectations for the Bank of Japan to offer fresh stimulus this summer to sustain growth.
After speeding past many of its developed country peers in the first half of last year, Japan's economy has slowed in recent quarters as the effects of Tokyo's aggressive stimulus faded. Concerns of a deeper pullback have hit investor confidence and the stock market this year, although policymakers say they are prepared to look through short term dips in growth.
The BOJ has repeatedly shrugged off speculation of fresh easing, insisting that the economy is on track to meet its 2 percent inflation target, but the burden may fall more on the government to take further steps to support business investment.
""Exports are weak because Japanese products are not as competitive as they used to be,"" said Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""This suggests the economy will struggle to recover after the sales tax hike. The government needs to do more with its growth strategy to make companies more competitive.""
The weakness in exports - a key driver of the world's third-biggest economy - has been a concern for policymakers, who are counting on stronger shipments to help cushion any slide in domestic demand after the sales tax rise to 8 percent from 5 percent.
Japan's shipments to China rose an annual 4.3 percent in March, a marked slowdown from a 27.6 percent annual increase in February.
Exports have struggled to accelerate despite a soft yen, which has boosted import costs more than it promoted shipments, leading to a record 21th straight month of trade deficits.
MOF data showed imports grew 18.1 percent in the year to March, boosted by elevated import costs of fuel due to a weak yen and the last-minute demand before the April 1 tax hike.
That compared with a 16.2 percent annual gain forecast by economists and followed a 9.0 percent rise in the previous month.
The country's trade balance stood at a deficit of 1.446 trillion yen in March, against an expected shortfall of 1.070 trillion yen, after a record trade gap of 2.79 trillion yen in January. That marked a record 21-month run of deficits.
Japan's government cut its overall economic view for the first time since 2012 due to pullback in demand after the tax hike. But it saw no need for more stimulus, saying that the economy was on track for a moderate recovery.
Policymakers and economists expect a temporary dip in economic activity in the current quarter due to the sales tax rise, but they see the economy returning to moderate growth in the following quarters.

807,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 12:55PM ET</span>",Yellen: rates to stay low even as economy recovers,"Investing.com - The Federal Reserve will keep benchmark interest rates low even as the economy improves to ensure sustained recovery, as a persistent slackness in the labor market will require low borrowing costs, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Tuesday.
Monetary authorities hope to see the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 reaching 5.2-5.6% and inflation at 1.7-2%, Yellen said.
""If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks in a speech she delivered at the Economic Club of New York.
In the meantime, markets should pay close attention to inflation and unemployment rates, as hiccups can serve as weather vanes when it comes to monetary policy and how long interest rates remain low.
""The larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives, and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained,"" Yellen said.
""This approach underscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain the appropriate degree of accommodation to support the recovery. The new guidance also reaffirms the FOMC's view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one indicator, but that it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, inflation, and financial developments,"" Yellen said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank's monetary policy group.
The fed funds rate currently stands at a rock-bottom 0.00-0.25%.
The Fed is also purchasing $55 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery by suppressing long-term borrowing costs, a program the Fed has been gradually tapering this year to prepare the economy to stand on its own two feet without stimulus.
While the country has seen some disappointing economic indicators this year, the economy will continue to recover.
""In recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to judge whether the data are signaling a material change in the outlook. The unusually harsh winter weather in much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my FOMC colleagues and I generally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was weather related,"" Yellen said.
""The continued improvement in labor market conditions has been important in this judgment. The unemployment rate, at 6.7%, has fallen three-tenths of 1 percentage point since late last year.""

810,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 09:45AM ET</span>",US Factory Output Rebounds In March After Cold Winter,"By Reuters - U.S. manufacturing output rose for a second straight month in March in a sign of recovery from a long winter that had put a damper on activity.
Factory production increased 0.5 percent in March, according to data from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.
Overall industrial production was up 0.7 percent, beating analysts' expectations. February's industrial production was revised up to a gain of 1.2 percent from a previously reported 0.6 percent rise, due to stronger gains for durable goods manufacturing and for mining, the Fed said.
Mining output rose 1.5 percent in March, while utilities were up 1.0 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent jump in manufacturing output, and a 0.5 percent rise in overall industrial output in March.
Capacity utilization, a measure of how intensively firms use their resources, was up to 79.2 percent from a revised 78.8 percent in February. March's capacity utilization rate was the highest since June 2008.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilization measures as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy, and how much room there is for growth to run before it becomes inflationary.

The U.S. Labor Department said Friday the producer price index increased 0.5 percent in March after slipping 0.1 percent in February. That was the largest increase since June last year, Reuters reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries to rise just 0.1 percent in March.
Food prices jumped 1.1 percent, the largest increase since May, after rising 0.6 percent in February.
Food prices were pushed up by a surge in the cost of pork, which saw its largest rise since August 2008. Sausage, deli meat and boxed meat prices rose by the most since August 1980, Reuters reported.
Producer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.6 percent, the biggest gain since March 2011. The so-called core PPI for final demand had declined 0.2 percent in February.

The Labor Department reported that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending April 4 fell by 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 300,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised total of 332,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to decline to 320,000.
Continuing jobless claims declined to 2.77 million, the lowest since January 2008, from 2.83 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an uptick to 2.85 million.
The four-week moving average was 316,250, down from the previous week’s total of 319,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

885,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2014 02:22PM ET</span>", Fed Minutes: Decision to scrap 6.5% threshold was unanimous,"The Federal Reserve Board of Governors unanimously voted to scrap a threshold at which interest rates would rise once the unemployment rate hits 6.5%, according to the minutes of the Fed's March policy meeting.
In the past, the Fed had indicated rates could rise when the unemployment rate hits or approaches 6.5% provided that figure accompanied a 2.5% inflation rate.
Today, the headline unemployment rate stands at 6.7%, not far from the previous threshold, though inflation remains well below 2.5%, prompting the Federal Reserve to do away with its rate-hike target.
""Participants agreed that the existing forward guidance, with its reference to a 6.5% threshold for the unemployment rate, was becoming outdated as the unemployment rate continued its expected gradual decline,"" the minutes read.
""Most participants felt that the quantitative thresholds had been very useful in communicating policy intentions when employment was far from mandate-consistent levels, but, with the economy having moved appreciably closer to maximum employment, the forward guidance should emphasize that the Committee is focusing more on a broader set of economic indicators.""
Stocks rose on the news, while the dollar softened, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that policy will remain accommodative for some time to come.
The March policy meeting minutes reflected that stance.
""With respect to forward guidance about the federal funds rate, all members judged that, as the unemployment rate was likely to fall below 6.5% before long, it was appropriate to replace the existing quantitative thresholds at this meeting,"" the minutes read.
""Almost all members judged that the new language should be qualitative in nature and should indicate that, in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 0.25% target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress, both realized and expected, toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation.""
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.23% at 79.67.

At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.Growth in the global economy was a bit below trend in 2013, but there are reasonable prospects of a pick-up this year. The United States economy, while affected by adverse weather, continues its expansion and the euro area has begun a recovery from recession, albeit a fragile one. Japan has recorded a significant pick-up in growth. China's growth remains generally in line with policymakers' objectives, though it may have slowed a little in early 2014. Commodity prices have declined from their peaks but in historical terms remain high.Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and most risk spreads remain low. Equity and credit markets are well placed to provide adequate funding, though for some emerging market countries conditions are considerably more challenging than they were a year ago.In Australia, the economy grew at a below trend pace in 2013. Recent information suggests slightly firmer consumer demand over the summer and foreshadows a solid expansion in housing construction. Some indicators of business conditions and confidence have improved from a year ago and exports are rising. But at the same time, resources sector investment spending is set to decline significantly and, at this stage, signs of improvement in investment intentions in other sectors are only tentative, as firms wait for more evidence of improved conditions before committing to expansion plans. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued.The demand for labour has remained weak and, as a result, the rate of unemployment has continued to edge higher. It will probably rise a little further in the near term. Growth in wages has declined noticeably. If domestic costs remain contained, some moderation in the growth of prices for non-traded goods could be expected over time, which should keep inflation consistent with the target, even with lower levels of the exchange rate.Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth is slowly picking up. Dwelling prices have increased significantly over the past year. The decline in the exchange rate from its highs a year ago will assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, but less so than previously as a result of the rise over the past few months. The exchange rate remains high by historical standards.Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand, and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

975,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 31, 2014 10:30PM ET</span>",China Slowdown Continues As HSBC PMI Hits 48.0,"By Reuters - BEIJING (Reuters) -- China's manufacturing engine contracted in the first quarter of 2014, a private survey showed Tuesday, adding to market expectations of government stimulus to arrest a loss of momentum in the world's second-largest economy this year.
The final Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to an eight-month low of 48.0 in March from February's final reading of 48.5. The outcome was in line with last week's preliminary PMI reading of 48.1.
The index has been below the 50 level since January, indicating a contraction in the sector this quarter.
""The final reading of the HSBC China Manufacturing PMI in March confirmed the weakness of domestic demand conditions,"" said Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief China economist, in a statement accompanying the survey.
""This implies that first quarter GDP growth is likely to have fallen below the annual growth target of 7.5 percent.""

Earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics' official PMI rose to 50.3 in March from the previous month's 50.2, in line with forecasts.
The HSBC/Markit PMI is weighted more toward smaller and private companies than the official index, which contains more large and state-owned firms.
A string of weak economic indicators in China this year has reinforced concerns about a slowdown. Premier Li Keqiang said last week the necessary policies were in place and the government would push ahead with infrastructure investment.
""We expect Beijing to fine-tune policy sooner rather than later to stabilize growth,"" said Qu, of HSBC.
In the Markit/HSBC PMI, output and new orders weakened but new export orders grew for the first time in four months, suggesting the slowdown has been driven primarily by weak domestic demand.
There was a substantial increase in the employment sub-index, though it remained below 50. The labor market is an area of priority for Beijing as it sees low unemployment as vital  to maintaining social stability.
Last month, sources told Reuters the central bank was prepared to loosen monetary policy in order to keep the economy growing at 7.5 percent.
The government wants to reduce the economy's dependence on exports and enhance the role of consumption, but it is unclear how much growth it might be willing to sacrifice to achieve that goal.

The Fed is now purchasing $55 billion in Treasury holdings and mortgage debt a month to help make broader financial conditions more accommodative to strengthen recovery.
The Fed's statement omitted previous language calling for considerations for hike rates if the unemployment rate approaches a 6.5% threshold, a policy tool known as forward guidance.
Even though the economy is improving, a highly accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate, the U.S. central bank said.
Fed officials said labor-market indicators were mixed but improving, though the unemployment rate remains elevated.
Still, recovery remains healthy enough to throttle back on stimulus tool such as monthly asset purchases but weak enough to do away from rate-hike thresholds.
""The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run,"" the Fed said in a statement at the end of its March policy meeting, the first under Chair Janet Yellen.
""With the unemployment rate nearing 6-1/2 percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance. The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.""
The U.S. unemployment rate hit 6.7% in February.
Overall, the economy continues to improve and warrants less Fed stimulus, though inflation rates are still running below the U.S. central bank's 2% target.
""Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow,"" the statement read.
""Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.""

The committee continues to expect growth in the first quarter of 2014 to be 0.9 percent and “growth in the second quarter expected to be only fractionally weaker than that,” the minutes showed, adding that the MPC’s concerns of an uneven growth that was heavily reliant on domestic demand and housing was “somewhat reduced” by the latest economic data.
During the meeting, the MPC also noted that optimism had grown among investors about the future of Britain’s economy, especially in comparison to its major trading partners, and that it was being viewed as a safe investment destination following ongoing tensions in Russian and Ukraine. However, the MPC was not concerned about a direct fallout of the Ukraine crisis on the British economy except for risks stemming from a “general rise in risk premia and via commodity markets” because the “direct trade and financial linkages between the United Kingdom and Ukraine were limited.”

Emerging markets too had stabilized after the volatile conditions of the previous month, the MPC noted, adding that there had been mixed developments in the international economy.
“The easing of tensions in some emerging economies had been accompanied by signs of further modest recovery in the euro area. But this had been set against disappointing data releases in the United States and Japan,” according to the minutes.
“Data on the euro area had been consistent with continuing modest recovery,” the minutes noted, and that a growth of 0.3 percent in the last quarter of 2013 was in line with MPC expectations, adding: “The data in the Asian and other large emerging economies had been mildly encouraging.”
The MPC voted to keep the Bank Rate unchanged at 0.5 percent and asset purchases at 375 billion pounds ($622 billion). The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled for April 9-10."

The dip in inflation was mainly attributed to a drop in prices of heating oil and motor fuels, while the increase in food prices contributed to a significant portion of the overall inflation rate, according to a press release from the Federal Statistical Office. Prices were up for dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese while vegetables, fruit and fish too were dearer, the release noted.

Compared with January, the consumer price index was up by 0.5 percent in February, which was attributed to seasonal factors such as a pick-up in prices of package holidays and clothing.

Growth in industrial production in China slowed to 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014, compared to a 9.7 percent expansion in December, and growth in retail sales narrowed to 11.8 percent from 13.1 percent in December, MarketWatch reported. A Wall Street Journal consensus estimate had pegged industrial production to expand at 9.5 percent and retail sales to grow at 13.5 percent.
Analysts at Societe Generale attributed the fall in retail sales to “anti-corruption drive and disinflation” while pinning the slowing of industrial production on rising inventories, according to MarketWatch.

Earlier, Premier Li Keqiang reportedly gave his vote of confidence to the future of the Chinese economy at a press conference to mark the conclusion of the National People’s Congress.
“The Chinese economy has great potential and resilience. We are capable of, and have the conditions to make sure the economy runs within a reasonable range,” he said, according to MarketWatch, before adding: “The situation this year is more complicated.”
The Shanghai Composite index, which had climbed to trade up 1.3 percent following Li’s comments lost some of its gains after the data release and was trading up 0.81 percent in late-afternoon trade. The Hang Seng index, which had rallied to trade up 0.5 percent subsequently fell to trade down 0.4 percent."

The Reserve Bank today increased the OCR by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.New Zealand's economic expansion has considerable momentum, and growth is becoming more broad-based. GDP is estimated to have grown by 3.3 percent in the year to March. Growth is gradually increasing in New Zealand's trading partners. However, improvements in major economies have required exceptional support from monetary policy. Global financial conditions continue to be very accommodating, with bond yields in most advanced countries low and equity markets performing strongly.Prices for New Zealand's export commodities remain very high, and especially for dairy. Domestically, the extended period of low interest rates and continued strong growth in construction sector activity have supported recovery. A rapid increase in net immigration over the past 18 months has also boosted housing and consumer demand. Confidence is very high among consumers and businesses, and hiring and investment intentions continue to increase.Growth in demand has been absorbing spare capacity, and inflationary pressures are becoming apparent, especially in the non-tradables sector. In the tradables sector, weak import price inflation and the high exchange rate have held down inflation. The high exchange rate remains a headwind to the tradables sector. The Bank does not believe the current level of the exchange rate is sustainable in the long run.There has been some moderation in the housing market. Restrictions on high loan-to-value ratio mortgage lending are starting to ease pressure, and rising interest rates will have a further moderating influence. However, the increase in net immigration flows will remain an offsetting influence.While headline inflation has been moderate, inflationary pressures are increasing and are expected to continue doing so over the next two years. In this environment it is important that inflation expectations remain contained. To achieve this it is necessary to raise interest rates towards a level at which they are no longer adding to demand. The Bank is commencing this adjustment today. The speed and extent to which the OCR will be raised will depend on economic data and our continuing assessment of emerging inflationary pressures.By increasing the OCR as needed to keep future average inflation near the 2 percent target mid-point, the Bank is seeking to ensure that the economic expansion can be sustained."""

1263,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 03, 2014 10:37PM ET</span>","Text: Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision","Investing.com - The following is the full text statement released by the Reserve Bank of Australia following its latest interest rate review on Tuesday.
""At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.Growth in the global economy was a bit below trend in 2013, but there are reasonable prospects of a pick-up this year. The United States economy, while affected by adverse weather, continues its expansion and the euro area has begun a recovery from recession, albeit a fragile one. Japan has recorded a significant pick-up in growth, while China's growth remains in line with policymakers' objectives. Commodity prices have declined from their peaks but in historical terms remain high.Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and most risk spreads remain low. Equity and credit markets are well placed to provide adequate funding, though for some emerging market countries conditions are considerably more challenging than they were a year ago.In Australia, recent information suggests slightly firmer consumer demand and foreshadows a solid expansion in housing construction. Some indicators of business conditions and confidence have shown improvement and exports are rising. At the same time, resources sector investment spending is set to decline significantly and, at this stage, signs of improvement in investment intentions in other sectors are only tentative. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued.The demand for labour has remained weak and, as a result, the rate of unemployment has continued to edge higher. Growth in wages has declined noticeably. If domestic costs remain contained, some moderation in the growth of prices for non-traded goods could be expected over time, which should keep inflation consistent with the target, even with lower levels of the exchange rate.Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth remains low overall but is picking up gradually for households. Dwelling prices have increased significantly over the past year. The decline in the exchange rate seen to date will assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though the exchange rate remains high by historical standards.Looking ahead, the Bank expects unemployment to rise further before it peaks. Over time, growth is expected to strengthen, helped by continued low interest rates and the lower exchange rate. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates."""

Average new home prices in China’s 70 major cities climbed 9.6 percent in January from a year earlier, easing from December’s 9.9 percent rise. It was the first time in 14 months that the country's home price rises eased, and the most recent sign that the government's four-year-plus campaign to rein in property risk may finally be working.
In month-on-month terms, prices climbed 0.4 percent in last month, just as they did in December, according to Reuters calculations of official data that was released Monday .

Data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics revealed that new home prices in Shanghai were up an annual 17.5 percent, compared with 18.2 percent in December, while Beijing prices climbed 14.7 percent in January from a year earlier, versus 16 percent in the month before.
Price increases in China's property has eased since late 2013, signaling that tightening measures by local governments, such as raising minimum down payments for second homes and vowing to supply more land for the building of residential properties, may be working.
Meanwhile, China's home prices are at record highs and nowhere near the reach of most ordinary citizens, which suggests that Beijing is still not about to let up anytime soon on the tightening measures it has been carrying out.
The Shanghai Composite fell on the news -- down 2 percent by late morning, with developers like Vanke leading the losses, according to CNBC. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1 percent.
Also weighing on sentiment were reports by the local media stating that some banks have begun to tighten loans to sectors such as property-related industries, Reuters reported, adding that a few banks issued denials.

Flash PMI Hits 7-month Low As Factory Activity Shrinks,"By Jeff Perlah - Factory activity in China decreased again in February as employment slid at the quickest rate in five years, a preliminary private survey noted on Thursday.
The flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) retreated to a seven-month low of 48.3 in February from January's final reading of 49.5. A reading under 50 shows a contraction while one above reveals expansion.

The final Markit/HSBC manufacturing PMI for February is due on March 3 and the official manufacturing PMI will be released on March 1.
The preliminary index for February got smaller in all categories save for delivery times of suppliers. The data indicates that the marginal easing that started in late 2013 hasn't let up in the world's No. 2 economy.
This month, the employment sub-index fell for the fourth month in a row, to 46.9, its unhealthiest point since February 2009, amid the worldwide financial crisis.
The frail China preliminary index for last month was considered to be a cause of January's selloff of emerging market assets, Reuters reported.
According to the survey, the new orders sub-index fell below 50 for the first time in seven months, while new export orders climbed higher than it did in January, but stayed less than 50.
""The building-up of disinflationary pressures implies that the underlying momentum for manufacturing growth could be weakening,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC, in a comment accompanying the PMI data.
""We believe Beijing policymakers should and can fine-tune policy to keep growth at a steady pace in the coming year.""
The Markit/HSBC PMI is weighted more toward smaller and private firms than the official index, which contains a greater amount of larger and state-owned companies.
The Lunar New Year festival, which started Jan. 31 and continued into early February, probably had an influence on factory output considering manufacturers closed up business then.
The government's continuing efforts at restructuring the Chinese economy toward domestic consumption and away from exports also had a role in the decrease.
Data pointing to a slowdown in China's Factory activity has emerged in the past few months. PMIs in January showcased expansion in China's manufacturing and services sectors at several-month or several-year lows, according to Reuters.
Still, those readings were countered by healthy growth in exports and bank lending, suggesting that China econony wasn't doing as bad as some had believed.
China's full-year growth for 2013 was 7.7 percent, steady from 2012 and just slightly above market expectations of 7.6 percent, which would have been the slowest since 1999.

At its Jan. 28-29 policy meeting, the Fed voted to trim its monthly asset-purchasing program to $65 billion from $75 billion and stressed benchmark interest rates will stay at 0.00-0.25% until the unemployment rates approaches 6.5% or even dips below that mark, depending on the health of the economy in the context of price stability.
Asset purchases aim to spur recovery by suppressing long-term interest rates, a strategy that sends investors to stocks to spur investing and hiring, thus weakening the dollar as a side effect.
The minutes released on Wednesday, however, revealed that monetary authorities sought to ditch language suggesting rates may rise if the unemployment rate falls past 6.5%, a policy tool known as forward guidance.
""Participants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6-1/2 percent, it would soon be appropriate for the Committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide information about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed,"" the minutes reported.
The unemployment rate currently stands at 6.6% though many still remain out of the labor force due to fruitless job searches, which artificially lowers the percentage headline unemployment rate.
Those out of work but not actively seek jobs are not counted as part of the labor force.
Still, members were divided on how to signal to the economy their take on the country's future health, with one camp calling for fresh numbered targets or thresholds and another favoring language.
""Some participants favored quantitative guidance along the lines of the existing thresholds, while others preferred a qualitative approach that would provide additional information regarding the factors that would guide the Committee's policy decisions,"" the minutes read.
""Several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and several participants argued that the forward guidance should give greater emphasis to the Committee's willingness to keep rates low if inflation were to remain persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.""
Elsewhere, Fed officials were willing to overlook January's soft jobs report and other economic indicators taking into account a string of powerful winter storms may have disrupted commerce.
While some hawkish member felt the time to hike interest rates will come soon, consensus pointed to keeping rates on hold while dismantling monthly bond purchases.
""All members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting,"" the minutes read.
""Members again judged that, if the economy continued to develop as anticipated, further reductions would be undertaken in measured steps.""
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.23% at 80.24.

1478,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 13, 2014 02:25PM ET</span>", Why Were January US Retail Sales Worse Than Expected?,"By Meagan Clark - Unusually cold weather was partly to blame for weaker-than-expected retail sales in January, but consumer spending fell more than expected across-the-board, indicating that the economy is not picking up as quite as quickly as economists had predicted.
Sales dropped 0.4 percent, month over month, in January and rose 2.6 percent year over year. Economists had expected flat month-over-month retail sales and slightly higher year-over-year growth. Instead, the fall in sales is the first decline in core retail sales since February of last year.

“The report was discouraging and many are going to point to extreme winter weather conditions as the primary cause for the larger-than-expected decline,” according to a Thursday report from Briefing.com.
The decline in retail sales was partly due to a 2 percent fall in auto sales, Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Thursday. Gasoline station sales and building material sales increased by 1.1 percent and 1.4 percent month over month, respectively, partly offsetting the drop in overall sales.
Excluding auto, gasoline and building materials sales, household consumption fell by 0.3 percent in January compared to December.
Sectors affected most by the weather, like restaurants, sporting goods and motor vehicles, reported declines in sales (0.6 percent, 1.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively).
But weather may not explain why online sales also decreased by 0.6 percent, or why sales of building materials increased, unless nearly everyone bought salt and shovels (not likely).
Steve Blitz, chief economist for ITG Investment Research, pointed out Thursday that the ""weather in November didn’t seem enough to keep people from spending.”
“Stay-at-home shopping should not be a weather-related event,” Blitz said. “If anything, one would think that bad weather boosts shopping by click.”
But instead, non-store retail sales grew by 6.5 percent from January 2013, the weakest January growth since 2012. Since 1993, the average January year-over-year rate has been 8.6 percent, and beginning with 2003, the average is 8.3 percent. The weak general spending in January could mean that December’s spending out of savings was a one-time event for the holidays and not the start of a trend.
“The main issue,” Blitz said, “is that economy is growing but not accelerating.”
Blitz predicts consumption will pick up in the next few months, encouraging those anticipating a year of accelerating growth in the economy.
Dale forecasts annualized consumption will end the first quarter at 2 to 2.5 percent, even after factoring in strong spending on heating in January and an expected rebound in retail sales in February and March. That consumption growth would be slightly less than the fourth quarter’s 3 percent growth.

The U.S. econony added only 113,000 jobs in January - a sub-par job growth rate that may prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to re-evaluate its stimulus reduction timetable. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected the economy to create 181,000 jobs in January.
As noted, the second straight month of weak hiring - marked by declines in retail, utilities, government, and education and health employment - could be a problem for the Federal Reserve, which is tapering its monthly bond-purchasing stimulus program.
Meanwhile, December payrolls were raised only 1,000 to 75,000.

The data also comes on the heels of a report on Monday showing a surprise drop in factory activity to an eight-month low in January and could rattle investors, already nervous about slowing global growth, Reueters reported.
However, there was a silver lining in the report. The unemployment rate dropped a tenth of a percentage point to 6.6 percent last month, the lowest since October 2008.
The household survey from which the jobless rate is derived showed gains in employment. In addition, more people came into the labor force, an encouraging sign for the labor market, Reuters reported.
The participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63 percent from 62.8 percent in December, when it fell back to the more than 35-year low hit in October.

HSBC Services PMI Retreats To 50.7,"By Jeff Perlah - The services sector in China expanded in January at its weakest pace since August 2011 after companies achieved a smaller volume of new business, a private survey has revealed. The new data adds to mounting indications of easing in the world's second-largest economy.
The HSBC/Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.7 in January, a low last seen two and half years ago. However, the findings are above the 50-point level that separates growth and contraction. The PMI in December was 50.9.
Slower growth in the services sector stemmed from a cooldown of activity at factories and China's attempts at limiting excessive state spending.

The index is the last of China's four monthly PMI releases, and all have pointed to economic growth quieting in January on easing demand.
The PMI on Friday revealed that new business growth hit its lowest point in  seven months, and that could keep alive economists' debate over whether the flimsy demand in January was caused, for the most part, by the Jan. 31 start of Lunar New Year celebrations, especially considering many businesses shut down early for them.

1603,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2014 10:33PM ET</span>",TEXT - Reserve Bank of Australia keeps cash rate at record low 2.5%,"Investing.com - Below is the full text statement by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens on Tuesday's decision to leave the cash rate at a record low 2.5%:At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.Since the Board's previous meeting, information on the global economy has been consistent with growth having been a bit below trend in 2013, but with reasonable prospects of a pick-up this year. The United States economy continues its expansion and the euro area has begun a recovery from recession, albeit a fragile one. Japan has recorded a significant pick-up in growth, while China's growth remains in line with policymakers' objectives. Commodity prices have declined from their peaks but in historical terms remain high.The Federal Reserve has begun the process of curtailing stimulus measures but financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and most risk spreads remain low. Equity and credit markets remain able to provide adequate funding, but for some emerging market countries conditions are considerably more challenging than they were a year ago.In Australia, information becoming available over the summer suggests slightly firmer consumer demand and foreshadows a solid expansion in housing construction. Some indicators of business conditions and confidence have shown improvement. At the same time, with resources sector investment spending set to decline significantly, considerable structural change occurring and lingering uncertainty in some areas of the business community, near-term prospects for business investment remain subdued. The demand for labour has remained weak and, as a result, the rate of unemployment has continued to edge higher. Growth in wages has declined noticeably.Inflation in the December quarter was higher than expected. This may be explained in part by faster than anticipated pass-through of the lower exchange rate, though domestic prices also continued to rise at a solid pace, despite slower growth in labour costs. If domestic costs remain contained, some moderation in the growth of prices for non-traded goods could be expected over time.Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and savers continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth remains low overall but is picking up gradually for households. Dwelling prices have increased further over the past several months. The exchange rate has declined further, which, if sustained, will assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy.Looking ahead, the Bank expects growth to remain below trend for a time yet and unemployment to rise further before it peaks. Beyond the short term, growth is expected to strengthen, helped by continued low interest rates and the lower exchange rate. Inflation is expected to be somewhat higher than forecast three months ago, but still consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates."

1605,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 03, 2014 06:00PM ET</span>",January 2014 US Auto Sales: Brrrrrrr...,"By Angelo Young - The story of January U.S. auto sales performance is really a weather-related one. As expected, the winter blast that covered much of the country for significant portions recent weeks hit new-auto sales in a month that traditionally sees the softest dealership foot traffic of the year. What was unexpected was the extent of the effect.
“This is definitely lower than expected, and people hate when other people blame things on weather, but I think we really did see some pronounced patterns,” said Jessica Caldwell, senior autos analyst for auto information and pricing provider Edmunds.com. “Looking at our transaction data during that time period [during cold wave that struck in the first week of January], we saw our transaction data look really, really low. Sales were brought to a near halt in affected areas. The bright side was that when temperatures went up we saw a makeup of those lost sales.”

But then another cold front struck toward the end of the month, sending icy conditions into the Deep South (ice was witnessed as far south as palmy and balmy New Orleans) that kept customers away in large portions of the country.
Edmunds.com estimated Monday afternoon that U.S. auto sales came in a 1,010,000 units, a 3 percent drop from January 2013. That’s roughly 40,000 fewer sales than many analysts expected and about 130,000 fewer units than January 2006, in which sales hit a 10-year-high of 1.14 million vehicles. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) came in below forecasts at between 15.1 million and 15.2 million.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) saw the most pronounced decline among the high volume sellers. (Volkswagen sales dropped more by percentage, but GM sells about seven times more units in the U.S. than its German competitor.) North America’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a nearly 12 percent drop in volume, in part due to its reluctance to grow incentive spending, where it typically leads the pack.
“Although GM saw broad declines across their product portfolio in January, they enjoyed a 2.1 percent increase in average transaction prices,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst for auto pricing and information provider Kelley Blue Book. “With transaction prices up and incentive spend on trucks down, GM is pursuing profitability rather than volume, a strategy that will benefit their resale values in the long term.”
But so far nobody seems too concerned about how January might impact sales later this year. Both Ford and GM have higher-than-desirable inventories that they expect to sell down on as the first quarter continues.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index – a measurement of what companies are buying that gauges sentiments among producers of goods – shows a decline in orders, but pointed to the weather as the main driver of the decline.
The University of Michigan consumer confidence reading for January declined slightly, thanks to more negative sentiments from households with incomes of less than $75,000 a year, but households at all income levels reported improvements in personal finances compared to this time last year.
“As we look into 2014, we do see a continued improving trend in the incoming indicators and some indications that growth this year could be better than the first estimate of 1.9 percent [U.S. new-auto sales] growth rate for the full year 2013,” Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford’s senior economist, said during a conference call on Monday.

The drop indicates that China's service sector slowed to a five-year low in January, and further highlights stuttering momentum in the world's second-largest economy, which could enhance investors' worries about emerging markets.   Even though Monday's reading was the lowest since December 2008, it was still higher than the 50 point level that indicates growth. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; a reading below 50 reveals contraction.
 
The non-manufacturing PMI is based a survey released by the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and Federation of Logistics and Purchasing in January. The data compiled from monthly replies to questionnaires sent to purchasing executives of 1,200 companies in 27 non-manufacturing industries, including construction, transport and telecommunications.     The business activity index for leasing, commercial services, hotels, postal services, marine transportation, real estate and public utilities dropped below the 50 threshold, with business volume falling.   The index of new orders dipped 0.1 point to 50.9. The services orders index slowed to 0.1 point as well, to 49.6.   New orders for industries like real estate, hotels, leasing and restaurants declined, signaling demand slowed down. But the business activity index for air and railway transportation and retail remained above 60, with business volume growing quickly, the NBS said. The construction industry posted a business activity index of 61, a 1.6 point decrease month on month.   The non-manufacturing figure arrived after news of a decline in last month's manufacturing PMI to a six-month low of 50.5 from 51 in December.

1647,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 30, 2014 11:30PM ET</span>",Japan Inflation Quickens As Abe Seeks Wage Hikes,"By Jeff Perlah - Inflation in Japan picked up speed in December, placing pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government to encourage wage gains as he attempts to free the nation from the deflationary debility that has lasted 15 years.
Prices excluding those of fresh food climbed 1.3 percent from a year before, said Japan's statistics bureau.
According to other data, 103 jobs were available for every 100 person hunting for employment, thus revealing a tightening in the labor market that might put pressure on companies to raise salaries.

Tokyo Metro Co., Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. and other companies have announced price increases, so the challenge for Japanese policymakers is to encourage wage increases while maintaining an exit from deflation after an April rise in the country's sales tax that's predicted to spur contraction.
Many economists believe the Bank of Japan will expand presently prominent easing in the first half of 2014, Bloomberg reported.
“Consumers will be hit in the pocket from rising prices and the upcoming sales-tax hike,” Masamichi Adachi, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo, said. “The onus is now on companies to convert their profits into wage increases and capital spending.”
As for Japanese manufacturing activity, the Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.6 in January, from 55.2 in the previous month.
It was the fastest pace that Japanese manufacturing activity has grown in almost eight years, as new orders expanded at a record rate -- and it was a sign of muscular domestic demand prior to an increase in the sales tax in April.
For the 11th consecutive month, the index stayed higher than the 50 threshold separating expansion from contraction, and it reached the loftiest level since February 2006.
""Evidence from panelists suggested that the upcoming rise in the sales tax was a key factor driving the recent expansion, as customers order early to avoid the higher tariff,"" Claudia Tillbrooke, economist at Markit, noted.
""However, the continued expansion of employment, suggests a degree of confidence in the longevity of the current upturn.""
The PMI index's output component climbed to 61.1 from 58.3 in the prior month to reach the highest spot since it was created back in October 2001.
The index for new export orders fell to 52.8 in January from 55.7 in the previous month.
In April, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government will raise the 5 percent sales tax to 8 percent in order to pay for climbing welfare costs, according to Reuters.
Sales of apartments, houses, cars and durable goods have been increasing since mid-2013 as the Japanese pubilc eyes relatively expensive items before the tax increase.

1672,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 29, 2014 10:00PM ET</span>",China HSBC Final PMI Falls To Six-Month Low In January ,"By Jeff Perlah - China's manufacturing activity decreased for the first time in six months in January, falling to 49.5 from December's 50.5 and from the 49.6 figure reported in a flash PMI released last week, an HSBC Bank survey revealed  Thursday.
The January data shows that business conditions in China’s manufacturing sector deterioratied as output and new orders decreased. Firms cut staffing levels at the fastest pace since March 2009. The average production costs fell at a marked rate, while firms lowered output charges for the second straight month. The data, overall, pointed to a weak start for China's economy in 2014.
""A soft start to China's manufacturing sectors in 2014, partly due to weaker new export orders and slower domestic business activities during January,"" Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC, said in a statement. ""Policymakers should pay attention to downside risks and pre-emptively fine-tune policy to steady the pace of growth if needed.""
Production levels continued to increase in January, extending a current sequence of expansion to six months, the survey noted. But growth rate eased to a marginal pace. While larger volumes of new work boosted production at some companies, others reduced output amid reports of a slowdown in client demand stemming from weak economic conditions.
As a result, the survey said, total new business was relatively the same in the previous month, following a five-month sequence of growth. Meanwhile, new export orders decreased for the second straight month in January, with firms noting weaker demand in several key export markets, according to the survey.
Last week's flash PMI reading, which arrived alongside signs of tightening in China's markets, was a factor in a decrease in global markets as investors were concerned about the impact of a slowdown in China's economy, various news agencies reported.

1678,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 29, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>","As Expected, Fed Cuts Stimulus Again","By Moran Zhang - As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted unanimously to reduce asset purchases on Feb. 1 by another $10 billion a month to $65 billion.
The Fed said information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters, while labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement, according to the statement from the Jan. 28-29 FOMC meeting.
The recent volatility in emerging markets was not mentioned in the statement.
The Fed emphasized again that bond-buying is not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on policymakers’ outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
The Fed did not change its targets for inflation, short-term interest rates or its desired unemployment rate. Economists predict the Fed will wind down its bond-buying program by the end of the year.
The 2014 Lineup
The January FOMC meeting offers the first glimpse of a new lineup of policymakers.
Janet Yellen, Bernanke’s close policy ally and current vice chair, is due to succeed him on Feb. 1. She will also be leading a rather different group than the one that backed Bernanke’s aggressive stimulus measures last year.
Outside of all of the changes on the Board of Governors, four new regional Fed presidents rotated into voting positions, joining the New York Fed president who has a permanent voting position on the FOMC. The remaining four seats rotate among the remaining 11 regional Feds in a regular three-year cycle; thus the voters in 2014 are mostly the same as those in 2011 and 2008.
    Although the mix of voting regional Fed presidents this year does skew slightly more hawkish, they will remain a minority. Both hawkish and dovish dissents are possible this year.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  
“Yellen’s first year as Fed chair has the potential to be volatile, and the changing cast of voters does introduce some modest uncertainty into the markets,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michael Hanson wrote in a note.
Last year’s voting regional presidents were fairly more co-operative. This year’s group seems to be a little more volatile. The dispersion of views among the voting Fed presidents is particularly wide, with Dallas’s Richard Fisher and Philadelphia’s Charles Plosser on the hawkish end, Cleveland’s Sandra Pianalto in the middle, and Minneapolis’s Narayana Kockerlakota on the far dovish side, according to Hanson.
That said, Hanson predicts Yellen will aim to stay the course.
Yellen’s Challenges
Refinements to the Summary of Economic Projections and a press conference after each FOMC meeting are likely high on Yellen’s agenda.
But while the Fed’s move to transparency is a good thing, “a Fed that reacts to the markets and holds press conferences to talk about how it’s reacting to the markets is a bad thing,” said Sam Wardwell, investment strategist at Pioneer Investments.
“I think people have become too short-sighted.” Wardwell said. “Monetary policies take 12 months to work, so you really don’t need a press conference eight times a year.”
In terms of the biggest challenge facing Yellen, Wardwell believes it is to rebuild the Fed’s balance sheet.
The Fed's third round of quantitative easing began in late 2011 when its balance sheet was less than $3 trillion. Data released by the central bank showed the Fed’s balance sheet crossed the $4 trillion mark earlier this month.
“I wouldn’t call it a bubble, but they [the Fed] have to figure out how to get that balance sheet back to normal,” Wardwell said. “If you look at the European Central bank, Europe is a mess, but the ECB has got a lot of dry powder. The Fed really doesn’t.”
“The Fed needs to rebuild its reserve situation, it needs to get rates up so they can lower them again and shrink its balance sheet, so if necessary, they can expand it again,” Wardwell added.

1679,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2014 02:05PM ET</span>","Fed leaves rates unchanged, trims bond-buying program by USD10 billion","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark lending target, the fed funds rate, unchanged at 0.00%-0.25% and trimmed USD10 billion from its USD75 billion monthly asset-purchasing program in place to spur recovery.
The Fed is now purchasing USD65 billion in Treasury holdings and mortgage debt a month to help make broader financial conditions more accommodative in order to strengthen recovery.
Economic activity is picking up, the labor market is making some improvement, while recent congressional inability to agree on spending packages is still dragging on recovery albeit less nowadays due to recent compromises.
Such a scenario prompted monetary authorities to taper the Fed's monthly bond purchases, which aim to push down long-term interest rates to boost the economy.
""Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement after its two-day monetary policy meeting concluded earlier.
""Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.""
The Fed added that even though it will be buying fewer bonds to prop up the economy, it will still continue to stimulate the economy until it feels comfortable with the labor market in the context of price stability.
""The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate,"" the Fed said in the statement.
The Fed added it will keep a close eye on economic indicators before deciding to wind down its stimulus program even further.
""If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings,"" the Fed said.
""However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.""
The decision, the last one with Ben Bernanke acting as Fed chairman, matched market expectations.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.05% at 80.68.
