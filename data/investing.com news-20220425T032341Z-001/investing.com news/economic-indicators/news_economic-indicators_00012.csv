WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in August as gasoline prices resumed their decline and a strong dollar curbed the cost of other goods, pointing to tame inflation that complicates the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates. 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.1 percent, the first drop since January, after edging up 0.1 percent in July. In the 12 months through August, the CPI rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in July.
Signs of a disinflationary trend reasserting itself are in stark contrast with a fairly healthy economy and a rapidly tightening labor market, and highlight the dilemma Fed officials face as they contemplate raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee was due to start a two-day meeting later on Wednesday. While solid data on consumer spending, housing and employment have been supportive of a rate hike, the case for higher borrowing costs has been undermined by recent global financial markets turmoil.
""You can make a strong case either way for the Fed to begin raising interest rates or waiting,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""The prudent risk management approach would argue for them to hold off, but if the Fed was really data dependent there is a very a strong case to raise rates on Thursday.""
U.S. financial markets were pricing a 29 percent probability of a lift-off in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate on Thursday, little changed from before the data's release. 
A Reuters survey of 80 economists showed 45 expected the U.S. central bank to keep its short-term interest rate near zero.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher in the wake of the soft CPI data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose marginally, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. 
Tightening labor market conditions, marked by record high job openings and a 5.1 percent unemployment rate, have so far not spurred faster wage growth. 
Sluggish wage gains and a strong dollar have contributed to keeping inflation below the Fed's 2 percent target. Economists had forecast the CPI unchanged in August and rising 0.2 percent from a year ago. 
DOLLAR DAMPENING INFLATION
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy
costs, ticked up 0.1 percent last month after a similar rise in July. The muted gains in the core CPI reflect the dollar's impact on the cost of imported goods. 
The dollar has gained 17.1 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased 1.8
percent. It was the fifth time in six months that the 12-month
change was 1.8 percent. The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, which is running well below the core CPI.
""One thorn in the Fed's side is inflation. I don't think today's CPI number really advances the debate on whether we are any closer to getting to that 2 percent target that the Fed is clearly focused on,"" said Mike Moran, head of economic research for the Americas at  Standard Chartered  (LONDON:STAN) Bank in New York.
Last month, gasoline prices fell 4.1 percent, the biggest drop since January, after rising 0.9 percent in July. Gasoline prices had risen for three straight months. Food prices gained 0.2 percent as the cost of eggs increased 7.7 percent.
Egg prices are now up 35.3 percent from a year ago, following the avian flu that struck some parts of the country early in the year. There were increases in prices for tobacco and apparel. However, airline fares fell 3.1 percent and used car prices declined for a fourth straight month. 
The rental index increased 0.3 percent last month, matching July's gain. Demand for rental accommodation is being driven by rising household formation as the sturdy labor market encourages young adults to leave their parental homes. 
The hot rental market is helping to fuel home building activity, with a separate report on Wednesday showing homebuilder confidence near a decade high in September.

The Commerce Department said consumer prices edged down by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, in line with forecasts following a 0.1% increase in July.
Consumer prices inched up 0.2% on a year-over-year basis, in line with expectations.
Core consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1%, also in line with the consensus forecast and were 0.2% higher from the same month a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending grew at a fairly healthy pace over the past two months, pointing to underlying strength in domestic demand that could strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates on Thursday.
While other data on Tuesday showed continued weakness in manufacturing, economists said that was unlikely to have much impact on the U.S. central bank's decision whether to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
""Looking at the data alone, Fed officials will probably say, yes, the conditions are right to tighten. If it were not for the increase in financial stress, they would be tightening this month,"" said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at  Standard Life  (LONDON:SL) Investments in Edinburgh.
The Commerce Department said retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.4 percent in August after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in July.
These so-called core retail sales, which correspond closely to the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, provided the latest sign of sturdy economic momentum and suggested the recent stock market sell-off had little immediate impact on U.S. household spending.
U.S. stocks were trading higher and the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell.
The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on Wednesday and Thursday against the backdrop of a tightening U.S. labor market, low inflation and slowing global growth. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate has remained near zero since December 2008.
U.S. financial markets have sharply dialed down expectations of a rate hike in the wake of the recent volatility in global equity markets. Traders are now pricing in a 27 percent probability of a rate hike on Thursday.
""The Fed should be more reassured about the underlying pace of demand growth with this sales report and, at the margin, we think this report takes us another step closer to a rate increase on Thursday,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
MANUFACTURING DRAGData ranging from employment to housing have suggested the U.S. economy retained most of its momentum from the second quarter, when output expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace.
Overall retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month as strong gains in auto sales were offset by a 1.8 percent drop in the value of sales at service stations as gasoline prices declined.
Receipts at auto dealerships rose 0.7 percent in August after rising 1.3 percent in July. There were sales increases for clothing stores, online retailers, restaurants and bars, sporting goods and hobby shops, and electronics and appliance outlets.
Receipts at building materials and garden equipment stores and furniture retailers fell despite a strengthening housing market.
The generally bright news on spending was tempered by the soft factory data. A separate report from the Fed showed manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent in August, hurt by a 6.4 percent drop in auto production, after increasing 0.9 percent in July.
Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the drop in motor vehicle and parts production last month because of the volatility tied to the annual summer plant shutdowns for retooling.
""As any automaker can tell you, the summer shutdowns are increasingly becoming a thing of the past as technology improves and the retooling process is either shorter or no longer tied exclusively to the summer months,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""The trouble is, the seasonal adjustment process does not yet know that.""
Excluding autos, factory output was unchanged last month. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by the headwinds of a strong dollar, slack economies oversees and lower oil prices.

A third report on Tuesday showed factory activity in New York state contracted in September for a second straight month.

American factories churned out 0.5 percent fewer goods last month, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday.
Some slowdown was anticipated after an earlier survey of factory manager sentiment pointed to a sharp brake in activity.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent decline in factory output.
The drop, combined with a fall in mining production and higher output for utilities, left overall industrial output 0.4 percent lower during the month.
Auto and autopart production contracted 6.4 percent, reversing much of the strong gains registered in July. Some of the slowdown in factory production could be due to a stronger dollar that is crimping exports, although sturdy domestic auto sales have given more reassuring signs for the economic outlook.
Capacity utilization in the factory sector fell to 77.6 percent last month from 78.0 percent.

Financial Markets
The discussion of financial markets opened with members observing that the marked increase in financial market volatility over the past month had mainly been a response to concerns about the resilience of the global economy, stemming primarily from developments in China. Much of the volatility had occurred in equity markets, with fixed income and foreign exchange markets generally exhibiting less volatility.
Members discussed the implications of the changes in mid August to the manner in which the People's Bank of China (PBC) set the daily fixing rate for the renminbi (RMB) against the US dollar, which had resulted in that exchange rate depreciating by around 4½ per cent over the course of a few days. The Chinese authorities had indicated that the intention of the change was to make the RMB more market based. While the resulting depreciation of the RMB spot exchange rate against the US dollar was the largest since 1994, it was not out of line with short-term movements sometimes seen between the major freely floating currencies. Members noted that the depreciation had offset only a little of the sizeable appreciation of the RMB in trade-weighted terms that had occurred over the previous year in the face of a slowing Chinese economy, as the RMB had appreciated in line with the US dollar over that period.
After the initial depreciation, the RMB had been relatively stable against the US dollar. Members noted that the Chinese authorities had for some time been selling foreign exchange reserves to prevent the RMB from depreciating against the US dollar in the face of significant capital outflows. This contrasted with the experience in the previous decade, during which foreign reserves had been accumulated to limit the appreciation of the RMB in the face of capital inflows. Members noted that it was not clear which assets the Chinese authorities had sold as part of the recent intervention nor which assets were being bought by those taking capital out of China, but given the potential size of these flows, their effects on asset markets could be large.
To counter the liquidity drain from sales of foreign exchange reserves following the foreign exchange intervention, the PBC had reduced reserve requirements on Chinese banks by another 50 basis points in late August. The PBC had also lowered its benchmark lending and deposit rates by a further 25 basis points.
The depreciation of the RMB had had an immediate effect across much of Asia, with many Asian currencies depreciating and some central banks in the region reportedly intervening to stabilise their currencies. The Australian dollar had depreciated along with the RMB, but had quickly rebounded within a day or so. A few days later the Australian dollar fell very briefly to US$0.705, during a short-lived period of dislocation in foreign exchange markets. Over the course of August, the Australian dollar depreciated by 2½ per cent against the US dollar and by 1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The euro and yen had both appreciated notably against the US dollar over this period. The appreciation of the euro was somewhat at odds with other movements in financial prices, but appeared to reflect the closing out of carry trades that had been funded in euro.
Global equity prices experienced large swings over August and in net terms had declined sharply, mainly reflecting heightened concerns about China. Chinese equity prices had declined by more than 20 per cent over August – with very large daily and intra-day movements – and were more than 40 per cent below their peak in June, although still over 50 per cent above the levels reached in mid 2014.
The Australian equity market had also fallen sharply to around the levels of two years earlier, despite company profit results being consistent with expectations. Large falls in commodity prices over the past few years had resulted in the share prices of commodity producers falling to their lowest levels in a decade. In addition, share prices of financial sector entities had fallen substantially, particularly after two of the major banks announced substantial capital raisings.
Turning to the United States, commentary from Federal Reserve officials had been suggesting that a tightening of monetary policy in the United States could start at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Members noted, however, that the recent volatility in global financial markets had led to market expectations of an increase in the federal funds rate receding substantially, with only a one-in-three chance of an increase at the September meeting and an increase not fully priced in until early next year. As noted at previous Board meetings, it was possible that the first increase in the federal funds rate in around nine years could have significant effects on financial markets despite the fact that it had been well telegraphed.
Members noted that, in stark contrast to the large movements in equity prices, yields on 10-year US Treasuries had changed little in net terms during the recent period of equity market volatility. Australian bond yields had moved broadly in line with US yields. Bond yields in some emerging markets, including Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, had risen sharply, but in others, such as Mexico, they were little changed.
Financial market pricing indicated that the domestic cash rate was expected to remain unchanged at the current meeting.
International Economic Conditions
Members noted that growth in the GDP of Australia's major trading partners had eased in the June quarter as a result of weaker conditions in Japan and other east Asian economies, but remained close to its long-run average. Growth in industrial production, including in China, had eased further over recent months, while economic conditions in the United States and the euro area continued to improve. Globally, core inflation had generally been stable, but at levels below the targets of most central banks, and monetary conditions remained very accommodative. Weaker demand for commodities from China had resulted in falls in the prices of bulk commodities and base metals over the course of the year to date.
In China, data on economic activity in July suggested that growth had continued to ease. Members noted that this presented a downside risk to the overall outlook for growth in China over the coming year, although they recognised that it was too early to assess accurately the effect of several recent policy changes designed to support activity. Members also observed that growth in retail sales had been relatively stable and monthly data contained relatively little information about service sectors, which were becoming increasingly important for growth of the Chinese economy. Growth in fixed asset investment had continued to decline and, although conditions in some segments of the property sector had improved, it was likely to be some time before the existing stock of newly constructed dwellings was sold and residential property investment picked up. Production of many industrial products, including steel, had declined since the previous year, but iron ore imports from Australia had nonetheless continued to increase. Inflation remained below the central bank's target level, which provided scope for further policy easing should that be required. Members noted that the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets was not expected to have a significant direct effect on the near-term economic outlook.
In Japan, output contracted in the June quarter and core inflation had remained steady. While inflation was still below the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target, it had increased over the past two years and was likely to continue to be underpinned by further modest growth in base wages, which in turn reflected very tight labour market conditions. GDP growth had fallen in other east Asian economies in the June quarter, with trade volumes contracting and business investment growth slowing. Some of the weakness in trade values could be attributed to falls in intra-regional trade, part of which owed to the effect of lower oil prices. Indian GDP continued to grow at a solid pace and CPI inflation remained below the Reserve Bank of India's target for 2015.
The US economy appeared to have grown at an above-average pace around the middle of the year, which was consistent with further increases in employment and reductions in spare capacity in the labour market. Growth in household consumption had picked up to an above-average pace over the year to the June quarter, while growth in business investment had eased, in part reflecting weaker conditions in the oil sector. Core inflation in the United States appeared to have been increasing on an annualised basis since the start of the year.
Growth in the euro area economy had picked up a little over the past few quarters, although there was significant spare capacity across Europe and inflation remained well below the target of the European Central Bank.
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that the June quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Following the strong outcome in the March quarter, GDP growth in the June quarter was expected to be weak, partly reflecting a fall in resource export volumes as a result of temporary disruptions to production. GDP growth was expected to remain below average in year-ended terms, but members recognised that a number of indicators of domestic economic activity had shown some improvement over recent months.
Members began their discussion of the recent economic data by considering indicators of business conditions. Surveys of business conditions generally had shown further improvement over recent months and conditions were clearly above average levels in the household and business service sectors. Although survey measures suggested that business profits had increased to above-average levels, ABS data showed that, relative to nominal GDP, mining profits had declined further following falls in commodity prices and non-mining profits had remained relatively stable.
The ABS capital expenditure survey had suggested a further fall in mining investment in the June quarter and investment intentions in that sector implied a further sizeable fall in 2015/16, which was consistent with the Bank's current forecasts. Members discussed the implications of the recent emphasis on cost cutting in the mining sector, noting that it would probably lead to mining investment eventually stabilising at a lower level than had previously been expected. The capital expenditure survey also pointed to a decline in non-mining investment in 2015/16, but by less than implied by the survey taken three months earlier. Approvals for non-residential building also remained weak.
Members noted that differences in business conditions across the services and goods-related sectors of the economy were apparent in surveys as well as a range of other indicators of activity. In particular, above-average conditions in the household and business service sectors were consistent with the growth in employment and investment in those sectors. In contrast, although surveys of business conditions had improved for sectors related to the production and distribution of goods to be at around average levels, employment and investment in those industries had been little changed for some time. In addition, firms in these industries had indicated that they expected further falls in their overall investment over the year ahead.
Members observed that recent indicators of consumer sentiment and retail sales had been consistent with some increase in consumption growth. They also noted that conditions in the housing market overall had remained strong and that housing price inflation nationally had risen since the beginning of the year, notwithstanding regional disparities. In particular, the strength in housing price inflation had been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, mainly for detached houses, whereas housing price inflation had been modest in other parts of the country and negative in some market segments. Members noted that rapid growth in the construction of new apartments had helped to hold down inflation of their prices.
There had been a notable decline in the growth in lending for investment housing in July. Recent revisions to data submitted by two major banks implied that growth in credit for investment housing over the year to June had been stronger than earlier reported and growth in credit for owner-occupied housing commensurately weaker. Dwelling investment appeared to have declined slightly in the June quarter, but had been strong over the year. Forward-looking indicators had generally suggested further strength in the coming months.
Employment continued to grow strongly in July and the employment-to-population ratio had increased to its highest level since 2013. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained in the labour market – the increase in the unemployment rate in July had been accompanied by a pronounced increase in the participation rate, particularly among females. Forward-looking indicators of labour market conditions had been mixed; some were consistent with the unemployment rate remaining around current levels or even falling a little, while others pointed to a slight rise over coming months.
Indicators of wage inflation in the June quarter remained soft. The wage price index had been consistent with the Bank's forecast for a prolonged period of low wage inflation. Wage growth in all industries had been well below their decade averages, but there had been signs that wage growth may have stabilised somewhat in service sectors.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Members noted that the key news internationally over the past month had been developments in the Asian region. The weakening in Chinese economic activity combined with developments in Chinese financial markets had led to sharp declines in global equity prices. So far, this volatility had not impaired the functioning of other financial markets and funding remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers. Moreover, several recent policy measures designed to support activity in China had not yet had their full effect. Economic conditions in the United States and euro area had continued to improve, monetary policies globally remained very stimulatory and lower oil prices would support economic activity in most of Australia's trading partners. Overall, international economic developments had increased the downside risks to the outlook, but it was too early to assess the extent to which this would materially alter the forecast for GDP growth in Australia's trading partners to be around average over the next couple of years.
Domestically, the national accounts were expected to show that output growth had been weak in the June quarter, following a strong outcome in the March quarter partly as a result of temporarily lower resource exports. Over the past year, resource exports had grown strongly and further growth was in prospect as the production of liquefied natural gas ramped up. The depreciation of the Australian dollar in response to the significant declines in key commodity prices was also expected to support growth, particularly through a larger contribution from net service exports.
Recent data on investment intentions suggested that mining investment would continue to decline and non-mining business investment would remain subdued in the near term, despite survey measures of aggregate business conditions being above average. However, non-mining business investment was still expected to pick-up over time as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year and a further gradual rise in household expenditure.
Members noted that very low interest rates would continue to support growth in dwelling investment and household consumption. There were indications that the measures implemented by APRA had slowed the growth in lending for investment housing. Dwelling prices continued to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends had been more varied across other cities. The Bank was continuing to work with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. Prices in most other asset markets had been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices had moved lower and been more volatile recently, in parallel with developments in global markets.
Although the demand for labour had improved, particularly in service sectors, members noted that spare capacity remained and wage pressures continued to be weak. As a result, domestic cost pressures were likely to remain well contained and offset the expected rise in the prices of tradable items over the next couple of years. Inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years.
Given these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co, one of the world's largest asset managers and advised by former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, puts a ""below 50 percent chance"" the Fed will raise short-term interest rates this week, Pimco Group Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn told Reuters on Monday.
Ivascyn said Newport Beach, Calif-based Pimco believes the U.S. central bank's first rate hike in nine years will come before the end of the year, but not in September.
""The decision this week will be close,"" Ivascyn said. ""Global weakness, uncertainty around consumer sentiment, inflation still running below target are reasons the Fed will not move this week.""
Pimco held its quarterly forum last week. Pimco managing directors as well as senior advisers including Bernanke and consultant Gene Sperling discussed trends for economies and markets over next 12 to 18 months.
Ivascyn's views are widely followed as he helps Pimco oversee assets that totaled more than $1.52 trillion as of June 30, mostly in fixed-income securities. Pimco is a unit of Munich-based Allianz SE (DE:ALVG).
The recent market turmoil, stemming from China's currency devaluation, has called into question the Fed's long-telegraphed plans to raise rates from near zero this year, possibly as soon as Thursday. 
As of the end of August, the firm's $98.1 billion Pimco Total Return Fund had over 50 percent of its assets in mortgage-related assets and 19.19 percent in U.S.-government related securities. The fund also had 28.87 percent of its assets in emerging markets and 9.50 percent in investment-grade corporate credits and 5.40 percent in high-yield ""junk"" bonds.
The U.S.-government category may include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.
Pimco Total Return fund's short-duration instruments - which are commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets - stood at negative 23.05 percent. 
In having a so-called negative position in these cash equivalents and money-market securities, it is an indication of derivative use and short-term securities being put up as collateral as a way to boost leverage and increase the fund's holdings in bonds with longer maturities such as MBS, Treasuries and corporate bonds.

The Pimco Total Return Fund is posting returns of 0.72 percent so far this year as of Aug. 31, surpassing 85 percent of its category, Morningstar said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China unveiled details on Sunday of how it would restructure its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including partial privatization, as data pointed to a cooling in the world's second-largest economy.
The guidelines, jointly issued by the Communist Party's Central Committee and the State Council, China's cabinet, included plans to clean up and integrate some state firms, the official Xinhua news agency said. It did not elaborate.
Reform of underperforming state-owned enterprises is one of China's most pressing needs. But if not handled well, the restructuring could lead to hundreds of thousands of people being laid off and social instability.
Xinhua said the plans included introducing ""mixed ownership"" by bringing in private investment, and ""decisive results"" were expected by 2020.
The government will not force ""mixed ownership"", nor will it set a timetable, giving each firm the go-ahead only when conditions are mature, it said.
""This reform will be positive for improving the impetus of the economy and making growth more sustainable,"" said Xu Hongcai, director of the economic research department at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), a Beijing-based think-think.
Partial privatization, he added, would help establish ""check-and-balance and incentive systems"" at state firms.
China's government manages 111 companies centrally under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC. Local governments own and manage around 25,000 state-owned companies and the sector employs nearly 7.5 million people.
State firms will be allowed to bring in ""various investors"" to help diversify share ownership, and more state firms will be encouraged to restructure to pave the way for stock listings, Xinhua said.
Private investors will be encouraged to buy stakes in state firms, buy convertible bonds issued by state firms, or swap shares with state firms, it said, adding steps will be taken to curb corruption during reforms.
SOEs will be divided into commercial and public welfare-related businesses during the reform process. Oil and gas, electricity, railways and telecommunications were identified as sectors that could be suitable for limited non-state investment.
However, Beijing will have to persuade entrenched interests at local, provincial and national governments to relinquish some control over state enterprises and attract investors to buy shares after one of the worst stock market crashes in China's history.
MISSED FORECASTS
And Xinhua indicated full-scale privatization was not on the cards, saying the government was aiming to ""cultivate a large number of state-owned backbone enterprises with innovation capability and international competitiveness"".
The guidelines called for a flexible and market-based compensation system at state firms by linking pay with company performance. 
The details were issued after the government said growth in China's investment and factory output missed forecasts in August. The data followed weak trade and inflation readings, raising the chances that economic growth may dip below 7 percent in the third quarter for the first time since the global financial crisis.
""Overall, the economy is very weak and the central bank may have to continue cutting interest rates and banks' reserve requirement,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at  Commerzbank AG  (XETRA:CBKG) in Singapore. Zhou says growth would probably dip below 7 percent in the July-September quarter.
Some economists believe growth is already much weaker than official data suggests.
August power output, for example, rose just 1 percent year-on-year, and production of key industrial commodities such as steel and coal weakened.
Growth in fixed-asset investment, a crucial economic driver, slowed to 10.9 percent in the first eight months of 2015 - the weakest pace in nearly 15 years, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Sunday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast an 11.1 percent rise, compared with 11.2 percent in January-July.
Factory output rose a weaker than expected 6.1 percent in August from a year earlier. Markets had expected a 6.4 percent increase, up from July's 6.0 percent.
Annual growth in real estate investment also continued to cool to 3.5 percent in the first eight months, the weakest since early 2009, from 4.3 percent in January-July.
While home sales and prices are slowly recovering from a slump last year - property area sold rose at a slightly faster pace of 7.2 percent in January-August - analysts say it will take time for developers to work off a huge overhang of unsold houses.
SINGLE POSITIVE
Retail sales were the single positive surprise, growing 10.8 percent in August from a year earlier and above forecasts of 10.5 percent, the same as July.
But the increase did not appear to chime with corporate reports of slowing sales.
China's yuan devaluation in August and a plunge in stock markets since June have fueled fears of more economic shocks, although Premier Li Keqiang has brushed off concerns of a hard landing.
Most analysts say the economy is slowing gradually, but not facing a hard landing.
China's central bank has cut interest rate five times since November and repeatedly relaxed banks' reserve requirements (RRR) to try to boost the sputtering economy.
Further policy easing is widely expected and the government is trying to boost infrastructure investment.

The government is aiming for 2015 economic growth of around 7 percent, which would be the slowest in a quarter century.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment hit its lowest in a year in early September and producer prices were flat in August, signaling moderate economic growth and tame inflation that could weigh on the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates next week.
The slump in consumer sentiment and persistently weak inflation reported on Friday are in stark contrast with a tightening labor market. Sentiment was likely undermined by recent stock market volatility amid worries over China's slowing economy, while a strong dollar is dampening price pressures.
""The sharp deterioration in consumer confidence and the re-emergence of the disinflationary thrust in goods prices will factor prominently in the Fed's deliberations next week, and both are likely to add to the case for caution as they consider raising rates,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 85.7 early this month, the lowest since September last year, from a reading of 91.9 in August.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations also dropped to a one-year low, as households expected slower growth overseas to hit the U.S. economy. Consumers' expectations for current and future personal finances also took a knock.
But even as households took a dim view of the economy's outlook, there were only mild declines in sentiment towards motor vehicle and home purchases.
""We look to the final September survey results for any evidence of significant pass-through from weaker sentiment to actual purchasing activity, but expect robust income and job growth to outweigh these factors in actual consumption data,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index was unchanged in August after gaining 0.2 percent in July. The drag on producer prices from lower crude oil prices and a buoyant dollar was offset by an increase in margins for apparel, footwear and accessories retailing.
In the 12 months through August, the PPI fell 0.8 percent after a similar decline in July. It was the seventh straight 12-month decrease in the index.
FED'S CONUNDRUM
The ebb in consumer sentiment and benign price pressures despite a rapidly tightening labor market pose a dilemma for Fed officials who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Though job openings are at a record high and the unemployment rate is at a 7-1/2-year low, wage gains have been lackluster. Tepid wage growth and dollar strength have combined to keep inflation well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee meets on Sept. 16-17. The likelihood of a lift-off in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate has been diminished by recent financial market turbulence.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower on the data. Investor sentiment was also hurt after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said crude oil prices could fall to as low as $20 a barrel, citing oversupply and concerns over China's economy.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government debt rose.
Producer inflation is likely to remain muted in the near term after a report on Thursday showed import prices fell 1.8 percent in August, the largest drop since January.
The index for final goods fell 0.6 percent last month, with a 7.7 percent decline in gasoline prices accounting for nearly two-thirds of the drop. There also were decreases in the cost of jet fuel, grains, light motor trucks, and iron and steel scrap.
The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, shot up 0.9 percent in August after rising 0.4 percent in the prior month.
Almost half of the increase in August was attributed to a 7.0 percent surge in margins for apparel, footwear and accessories retailing.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent in August after rising 0.2 percent in July.
The dollar's 17.5 percent rise against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014 is restraining gains in the so-called core PPI. Core PPI was up 0.7 percent in the 12 months through August.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment turned positive in July-September and companies stuck to upbeat spending plans, a government survey showed, offering some relief for policymakers worried about a hit from slowing Chinese growth and ensuing market turmoil.
The poll, the first comprehensive business confidence survey for the current quarter, followed a recent run of gloomy data, including a survey showing the service sector's mood worsening in August.
""Big manufacturers appear a bit cautious about the outlook, probably due to uncertainty over China. But it's not as if they are all gloomy since U.S. demand remains strong,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Capital expenditure plans remain fairly strong, so I don't think we need to be too pessimistic about the economy,"" he said.
An index gauging sentiment at large manufacturers stood at plus 11.0 in July-September, rebounding from minus 6.0 in the previous quarter, a joint survey by the Finance Ministry and a research arm of the Cabinet Office showed on Friday.
Companies plan to raise capital expenditure by 6.1 percent over the business year that started in April, revised up from the previous poll's 5.9 percent gain, the survey showed.
But the index gauging big manufacturers' business conditions in October-December fell slightly, a sign some of them are feeling the pinch from weakening demand in China.
Higher capital spending and wages are critical to the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary policies known as ""Abenomics"", which aim to prod companies into spending more instead of sitting on huge cash piles.
After having pressured companies into raising wages last year, the government hopes to nudge them into boosting capital expenditure in a rare dialogue with private firms in October.
""We need to strengthen Japan's domestic demand to offset any negative impact from overseas economies,"" Economics Minister Akira Amari told reporters on Friday.
""From that perspective, we want to hold a public-private sector dialogue and one area we would look at is how companies are using their cash reserves,"" he said.
Japan's economy shrank in April-June and growth is expected to rebound only modestly in the current quarter as sluggish Asian demand hurts exports, keeping policymakers under pressure to offer further fiscal or monetary steps to rev up growth.

The survey's index measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. labor market appeared to gain momentum in early September as fewer Americans filed for weekly unemployment benefits, but weak inflation pressures may complicate the Federal Reserve's decision whether to raise interest rates.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 275,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the 27th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up 500 to 275,750 last week.
""Consistently low readings for initial and continuing jobless claims suggest that the separations side of the labor market remains healthy, and we see little reason to expect a meaningful shift in labor market dynamics in the near term,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
In another report, the Labor Department said import prices fell 1.8 percent last month as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods dropped, after sliding 0.9 percent in July. 
August's drop in import prices was the largest in seven months and suggested a strong dollar and soft global demand continued to put downward pressure on imported inflation. Import prices now have declined in 12 of the last 14 months. 
In the 12 months through August, import prices declined 11.4 percent, the largest drop since September 2009. 
Very low inflation, in the face of a tightening labor market and strengthening economic growth, poses a challenge for the Fed's policy-setting committee, which meets on Sept. 16-17.
Economists are divided on whether the U.S. central bank will raise rates at that meeting in the wake of recent volatility in global financial markets, which was sparked by fears of slower growth in China and other major emerging markets.
The Fed has not raised rates in nearly a decade.
""Coming at a time when the Fed is contemplating a lift-off in rates, the weak tone of this report should come as a key reminder to the Fed that the disinflationary impulse is re-emerging,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
U.S. stocks were generally flat, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose. The dollar was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies.
HEALTHY JOB MARKET 
The labor market is tightening rapidly. Job openings are at a record high and the economy has added an average of 221,000 jobs per month over the past three months, far more than the amount needed to keep up with population growth.
The unemployment rate, which is at a 7-1/2-year low of 5.1 percent, is within the range that most Fed officials see as consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation. That could bolster expectations that a pick-up in wages will help lift inflation toward the central bank's 2 percent target.
For now, inflation is trending lower. Last month, imported petroleum prices tumbled 14.2 percent, the biggest drop since January, after falling 5.9 percent in July. 
Import prices excluding petroleum slipped 0.4 percent in August, the eighth consecutive monthly drop. 
That likely reflects the impact of the dollar's 17.5 percent rise against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014. Imported food prices rose modestly last month and prices for capital goods automobiles fell.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories fell in July for the first time in nearly two years, a tentative sign that businesses were starting to whittle down a huge stockpile of merchandise that could weigh on production in the second half of the year.

First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 27 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.

The four-week moving average was 275,750, an increase of 500 from the previous week’s total of 275,250. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Australia’s unemployment rate for the month of August fell to 6.2 percent, down from 6.3 percent a month earlier.
The number of unemployed fell by 14,400 to just over 780,000 while 17,400 new jobs were created last month, according to figures released Thursday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Full-time jobs rose by 11,500 -- reflecting an uptick in hiring by employers buoyed by record-low interest rates, weak wage growth and falling currency.
“Even with the volatility that goes from month to month, the fact is, over the last three months … nearly 60,000 jobs have been created in Australia,” Joe Hockey, the country’s federal treasurer, reportedly said. The number of jobs added in August was three times over economists' estimates.
Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), citing “very accommodative” global financial conditions and falling terms of trade -- the value of a country’s exports relative to its imports -- in Australia, announced that it will continue to hold interest rates at a record low of 2 percent.
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar, which recently hit a six-year low amid plunging commodity prices -- caused by a drop in Chinese demand -- briefly touched 70 cents against the U.S. dollar before dropping to 69.45 cents.
“Just as the appreciation [of the Australian dollar] helped stabilize the economy in the upswing of the boom in commodity prices and mining investment, the depreciation is helping in the downswing,” Philip Lowe, deputy governor of the RBA, reportedly said Wednesday.
However, while the better-than-expected employment figures were welcomed by analysts and the Australian government, many cautioned falling domestic and global demand might crimp employment growth in the future.
“The slowdown in GDP growth to its weakest in over four years in the second quarter suggests that a cooling of employment growth may still lie ahead,” Daniel Martin, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
In the second quarter of this year, Australia’s economy expanded 0.2 percent from the previous quarter -- lower than the expected 0.4 percent."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturers slashed prices at the fastest rate in six years in August as commodity prices fell and demand cooled, signaling stubborn deflation risks in the economy and adding to expectations for further stimulus measures.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 5.9 percent in August from the same period last year, its 42nd consecutive month of decline and the biggest drop since the depths of the global financial crisis in late 2009, data showed on Thursday.
The market had expected a decline of 5.5 percent after a drop of 5.4 percent in July.
""The change in PPI is very worrying. It could affect corporate profitability, which in turn could affect consumption and the economy,"" said Li Huiyong, economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities.
""We must step up policy support.""
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2 percent from a year earlier to a one-year high, the National Bureau of Statistics said, but the gain was due largely to soaring food prices, not an improvement in economic activity.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted CPI would rise 1.8 percent, compared with 1.6 percent posted the prior month.
Indeed, non-food inflation remained subdued at 1.1 percent, unchanged from July.
""The risk for China is still deflation, not inflation. PPI deflation will eventually filter down to affect CPI, and aggregate demand will continue to be weak,"" said Kevin Lai, chief economist Asia Ex-Japan at Daiwa, adding his firm had just cut its 2016 CPI forecast to -0.5 percent from 0.5 percent.
""In addition all the capital outflows (due to the slowing economy) will force the PBOC to continue purchasing yuan, which is hugely destructive to the monetary base,"" he said.
VICIOUS CYCLE
Continuously falling producer prices are eating into profits at many Chinese firms and raising the relative burden of their debts. Official and private factory surveys last week also showed manufacturers laid off workers at a faster rate last month as their order books shrank.
The central bank has cut interest rates five times since November and more reductions are expected in coming months, but many economists believe real rates are still too high, discouraging new investment.
Economists at ANZ said further policy easing is needed soon to head off the risk of a vicious cycle of slower growth and deflation. They expect the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirements (RRR) by another 50 basis points by year-end.
Data earlier this week showed imports tumbled more than expected in August while exports shrank again, pointing to persistently weak demand both at home and abroad.
Other data from China this week - including industrial output and investment on Sunday - are likely to be downbeat, keeping financial markets on edge. Fears of a China-led global slowdown have grown in recent weeks after a series of grim factory activity surveys.
The government is also still struggling to stabilize the yuan after its surprise devaluation of the currency on Aug. 11 and halt a stock market rout that has seen the country's share indexes plunge 40 percent since mid-June.
Analysts say weak data over the summer is putting Beijing's official 7 percent growth target for this year at risk.
That level would mark China's weakest expansion in a quarter of a century, but some economists believe current growth levels are already much weaker than official numbers suggest.
The chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Wednesday that China's economic fundamentals are healthy while still facing relatively large downward pressure.
Separately, the finance ministry said on Tuesday that it will strengthen fiscal policy, boost infrastructure spending and speed up reforms to support the economy.

For the full-text statement, see below:
Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today reduced the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.
Global economic growth remains moderate, but the outlook has been revised down due mainly to weaker activity in the developing economies. Concerns about softer growth, particularly in China and East Asia, have led to elevated volatility in financial markets and renewed falls in commodity prices. The US economy continues to expand. Financial markets remain uncertain as to the timing and impact of an expected tightening in US monetary policy.
Domestically, the economy is adjusting to the sharp decline in export prices, and the consequent fall in the exchange rate. Activity has also slowed due to the plateauing of construction activity in Canterbury, and a weakening in business and consumer confidence. The economy is now growing at an annual rate of around 2 percent.
Several factors continue to support growth, including robust tourism, strong net immigration, the large pipeline of construction activity in Auckland and other regions, and, importantly, the lower interest rates and the depreciation of the New Zealand dollar.
While the lower exchange rate supports the export and import-competing sectors, further depreciation is appropriate, given the sharpness of the decline in New Zealand’s export commodity prices.
House prices in Auckland continue to increase rapidly and are becoming more unsustainable. Residential construction is increasing in Auckland, but it will take some time to correct the imbalances in the housing market.
Headline CPI inflation remains below the 1 to 3 percent target due to the previous strength in the New Zealand dollar and the halving of world oil prices since mid- 2014. Headline inflation is expected to return well within the target range by early 2016, as the earlier petrol price decline drops out of the annual inflation calculation, and as the exchange rate depreciation passes through into higher tradables prices. Considerable uncertainty exists around the timing and magnitude of the exchange rate pass-through.
A reduction in the OCR is warranted by the softening in the economy and the need to keep future average CPI inflation near the 2 percent target midpoint. At this stage, some further easing in the OCR seems likely. This will depend on the emerging flow of economic data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in July and employers appeared to have trouble filling openings, the latest signal of an increasingly tight labor market that could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. It was published ahead of the U.S. central bank's Sept. 16-17 policy meeting.
Despite the tightening labor market and a strong rebound in economic growth, the probability of a rate hike at next week's Fed meeting has been diminished by recent volatility in global stock markets.
""Will today's blowout job openings number tilt the scales at all for next week's Fed decision? One might think it should matter ... but with data dependency apparently now extended to how equities trade, it is not certain how this report will shade their thinking,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 430,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.8 million, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. That was the highest level since the series started in December 2000 and pushed the jobs openings rate to 3.9 percent in July after holding steady at 3.6 percent for three straight months.
Hiring, however, dipped to 5.0 million in July from 5.2 million the prior month. The hiring rate slipped to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent in June.
""The data now signal unambiguously that the labor market is unable to supply the people companies need. Usually, that means wages will accelerate, though the evidence for that now is mixed,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics in New York.
SLOWER PACE OF LAYOFFS
While labor market slack is diminishing rapidly, it has not spurred strong wage growth, leaving inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
The labor market tightness was underscored by a sharp drop in the number of unemployed job seekers per open job to a record low ratio of 1.44 in July from 1.56 in June.
""Combining these data with figures from the Labor Department's employment report suggests that labor market slack continues to diminish,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York. ""On balance, the data suggest labor demand held up solidly at the beginning of the third quarter.""
The JOLTS report also showed a slower pace of layoffs in July, with the layoffs and discharges rate falling to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent the prior month. But the quit rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, was unchanged at 1.9 percent for the fourth straight month.
Job openings were concentrated in professional and business services, accommodation and food services, retail trade and nondurable goods manufacturing. There were strong increases in job vacancies in most private, service-providing industries.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending, including healthcare spending, increased at a faster pace than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month.

Economists said that suggested second-quarter GDP growth could be raised to a 3.9 percent annual pace from the 3.7 percent rate the government reported last month.

In a report, the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.753 million from 5.323 million in June, whose figure was revised up from a previously reported 5.249 million. Analysts had expected the number of job openings to fall to 5.288 million in July.
The report has garnered more attention lately, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen often cites the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.

The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, in line with expectations.
Inflation has evolved in line with the outlook in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report. The dynamics of GDP growth in Canada outlined in July’s MPR also remain intact. The stimulative effects of previous monetary policy actions are working their way through the Canadian economy.
Canada’s resource sector continues to adjust to lower prices for oil and other commodities, with some spillover to the rest of the economy. These adjustments are complex and are expected to take considerable time.
Increasing uncertainty about growth prospects for China and other emerging-market economies, in contrast, is raising questions about the pace of the global recovery.
Movements in the Canadian dollar are helping to absorb some of the impact of lower commodity prices and are facilitating the adjustments taking place in Canada’s economy.
""Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate,"" the bank's statement read.

Exports of goods decreased by £2.3 billion to £22.8 billion, the lowest export figure since September 2010. This is attributed to decreases in semi-manufactures, specifically chemicals, of £1.0 billion and finished manufactures of £0.8 billion.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2015 08:50AM ET</span>","China imports sink in August, shares rally but volumes dive","By Pete Sweeney and Samuel Shen
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's imports tumbled in August, raising concerns about the health of the world's second-largest economy and its contribution to global growth.
The data will add to the pressure on Beijing policymakers trying to ensure China's economy avoids a hard landing, though authorities will take some comfort that their efforts to steady the country's stock markets were rewarded with a late rally on Tuesday.
Imports dived 13.8 percent from a year earlier, far more than analysts had forecast, and a tenth consecutive monthly drop, reflecting both lower global commodity prices and sluggish demand.
A surprise devaluation in the yuan early last month combined with slowing consumer demand will dent the prospects of imports picking up significantly anytime soon.
Much of China's imports are commodities and other raw materials going into factories that turn them into goods for sale overseas, so the fall could be an ominous sign for exports in the coming months.
Exports fell less than forecast, sliding 5.5 percent, but analysts were still doubtful that China can now achieve its year-end trade growth target of 6 percent.
""The yuan devaluation will have limited impact on exports, which are falling because demand is weak, not because the price is not good,"" said Li Jian, head of foreign trade research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Commerce Ministry's think-tank.
China's foreign exchange reserves posted their biggest ever monthly fall in August, reflecting Beijing's efforts to stabilize the yuan following its devaluation.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, said its intervention in the forex market was one of the reasons for the drop in foreign exchange reserves, adding that any future fluctuations in reserves would be ""normal"".
The bank said in a statement late on Tuesday that China's economy could maintain medium- to high-speed growth in the long term, and the current account would remain in surplus, also over the long term.
STOCKS VOLUMES TUMBLE
Chinese policymakers have been trying to reassure financial markets that their currency is stable and that the recent stock market turbulence is easing.
Stocks have fallen around 40 percent since mid-June, with the Shanghai Composite Index hovering around the 3,000 point level, having been above 5,000 less than three months ago.
Shares initially declined on Tuesday but rallied later in the day to finish almost 3 percent higher - though trading volumes in both stocks and futures were down sharply.
The CSI300 index of the biggest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed up 2.57 percent, while Shanghai was up 2.93 percent.
Volume in the Shanghai market was the lowest since February, a month when trading is usually thin due to the Chinese New Year Festival.
The stock futures market was hit by an abrupt reversal in policy that caused trading volumes to collapse. Last Wednesday, China raised the margin requirements for futures not being used for hedging purposes to 40 percent of the contract's value from 30 percent.
The futures contract for the CSI300 index maturing in September has seen volumes dive, logging 28,957 transactions on Tuesday, down almost 100 percent from a week ago. On Aug. 25, when markets were in a major sell-off, the contract saw 2.43 million transactions.
Chinese authorities have rolled out a series of measures to bring a sense of calm back to their stock markets and reduce short-term speculation.
On Monday, the finance ministry dangled incentives to encourage longer-term investments, saying it would remove personal income tax on dividends from shares held for more than a year, and halve it on those held for between a month and a year.
That announcement came hours after regulators and exchanges proposed introducing a 'circuit breaker' on the CSI300 index to help steady the market.
Analysts said these measures are unlikely to encourage many investors to come back into the market for stocks in either mainland China, known as A-shares, or Hong Kong, given the longer-term economic concerns hanging over the market.
""While investors see value in Hong Kong-listed Chinese equities, they're concerned about an inevitable U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike and Beijing's ability to manage A-shares, growth, capital flight and its currency,"" analysts at Nomura wrote in a client note.

In its statement, the PBOC also said new regulations imposed on the currency forwards market this month were not a form of capital control. The measures, introduced after investors speculated in the market, would help stabilize China's financial system at a time when increased yuan volatility is likely to cause more companies to incur foreign exchange losses, it said.

The National Federation of Independent Business said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index gained half a point to 95.9 last month.
The NFIB said the survey of 656 businesses had not been impacted much by the recent turmoil in global financial markets, which was triggered by concerns over slowing economic growth in China.
""Most of the interviews were completed before the big slide,"" the NFIB said in a statement.
Five of the index's 10 components increased last month, while three declined and two were unchanged.
The survey's labor market gauges improved further last month, supporting the view that August's job growth slowdown was an aberration. The U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that non-farm payrolls increased 173,000 last month, the smallest gain in five months.
Small business owners were slightly optimistic about sales, but did not believe it was a good time to expand. Owners were pessimistic about business conditions over the next six months and were noncommittal regarding capital and inventory investment.

The survey pointed to benign inflation pressures in the near term. Fourteen percent of small business owners reported reducing their average selling prices in the past three months, up one point from July. A net 15 percent planned to raise prices, down 2 points from July.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter although capital expenditure fell more than originally forecast, revised data showed, keeping policymakers under pressure to do more to energize the fragile recovery.
Analysts expect any rebound in July-September growth to be feeble as factory output unexpectedly fell in July and China's slowdown dampened prospects for a solid recovery in exports.
""Factory output lacks strength in July-September due to sluggish exports of cars and electric machinery,"" said Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""If consumer spending fails to pick up, the government may compile a supplementary budget"" to prop up growth, he said.
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualized 1.2 percent in April-June, less than the initial estimate of a 1.6 percent contraction, Cabinet Office data showed on Tuesday.
The median market forecast was a revision to a 1.8 percent contraction.
Capital expenditure fell 0.9 percent from the previous quarter, more than a preliminary 0.1 percent drop, clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy.
But the weakness in capital spending was offset by gains in inventories, which contribute to economic growth.
Inventory gains added 0.3 percentage point to growth, more than a preliminary 0.1 percent contribution, the data showed.
Japanese policymakers are clinging to the hope that companies will use the record profits they earned from a weak yen and lower energy costs to boost wages and investment, generating a positive cycle of rising income and higher spending.
But a recent batch of soft data has cast doubt on such optimism and the Bank of Japan's argument that a steady recovery will help accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target by around September next year.

The BOJ is expected to offer a bleaker assessment on overseas economies at this month's rate review, sources say, although many in the bank prefer to hold off on expanding stimulus for now.

Gross domestic product stood at 63.6 trillion yuan ($10.00 trillion) last year, down by 32.4 billion yuan from the initial estimate, the bureau said in a statement on its website.
The bureau has revised down 2014 growth of the services sector by 0.3 percentage points to 7.8 percent, which helped drag down estimated GDP growth rate, it said.
The primary sector - the agriculture sector - grew 4.1 percent last year, while growth of the secondary sector, which includes manufacturing and construction, rose 7.3 percent.
After the revision, the services sector accounted for 48.1 percent of GDP last year, down from the previously announced 48.2 percent, the bureau said.
The manufacturing and construction sector accounted for 42.7 percent of GDP while the farm sector accounted for 9.2 percent.

The world's second-largest economy grew 7 percent in the first half from a year earlier - in line with the government's target for 2015, but recent downbeat data has raised the risk the government could miss the full-year growth target.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 173,000 last month after an upwardly revised gain of 245,000 in July, the Labor Department said on Friday. August's gain was the smallest in five months as the factory sector lost the most jobs since July 2013.
The jobs count, however, may have been tarnished by a statistical fluke that has often led to sharp upward revisions to payroll figures for August after initial weak readings.
Indicating the hiring slowdown was likely not reflective of the economy's true health, the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to 5.1 percent, its lowest level since April 2008.
In addition, payrolls data for June and July were revised to show 44,000 more jobs created than previously reported, bringing the average job gains for the past three months to a solid 221,000. Average hourly earnings increased 8 cents, the biggest rise in seven months and the length of the average workweek also expanded.
""The payrolls data is certainly good enough to allow for a Fed rate hike in September,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of currency strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn) in New York. ""The big question is still whether financial market volatility will scupper the plans.""
Stocks on Wall Street, which could be pressured by higher rates, ended down more than 1 percent. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar fell marginally against a basket of currencies.
While the mixed report did little to alter views that the U.S. economy remains vibrant despite volatile global financial markets and slowing Chinese growth, it could further complicate the Fed's decision at a policy meeting on Sept. 16-17.
In the wake of a recent global equities sell-off, financial markets significantly scaled back bets on a September rate hike over the past month. But Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC last week it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout had made an increase less compelling.
""With this jobs report ... the Federal Reserve finds itself in a real uncertainty jam,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (XETRA:ALVG) in Newport Beach, California.
MISSING FORECASTS
Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 220,000 last month, but they had also warned that the model used to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations is often thrown off at the start of a new school year.
They said the data could be further muddied because of a typically low response rate from employers to the government's payroll surveys in August.
But the evidence of a tightening labor market added to a string of upbeat data, including figures on automobile sales and housing, that has suggested the economy was moving ahead with strong momentum after growing at a robust 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
The decline in the unemployment rate brought it into the range that most Fed officials think is consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation, and would likely bolster their expectation that a pick-up in wages will help lift inflation toward their 2 percent target.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want
to work but have given up searching and those working part-time
because they cannot find full-time employment fell to 10.3 percent, the lowest level since June 2008.
In August, construction payrolls rose 3,000 on top of the 7,000 jobs added in July. Mining and logging employment fell by 10,000 jobs, the eighth straight monthly decline. 
The sector has shed 90,000 jobs so far this year, with industries that support mining activity accounting for 80 percent of the drop. Oilfield giants Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced thousands of job cuts this year.
Manufacturing payrolls slid 17,000 as sharp declines at metals, machinery and food industries offset a solid increase in employment in the automobile sector.
The 0.3 percent increase in hourly earnings left them 2.2 percent above their year-ago level, still well below the 3.5 percent growth rate economists consider healthy. 
Aggregate weekly hours rose 0.4 percent, the largest gain since November. The combination of more hours and higher earnings left workers with a 0.7 percent increase in their take-home wages. 
Some analysts think average hourly earnings are being held back by falling wages in oil field services.
But a tighter labor market and decisions by several state and local governments to raise the minimum wage should eventually translate into faster earnings growth.
A number of retailers, including Walmart (N:WMT),  Target  (N:TGT) and TJX Cos (N:TJX), have increased pay for hourly workers since the start of the year.
""Regardless of which meeting this year the Fed begins to raise rates, next year we expect core inflation to surprise on the upside, forcing the Fed into tightening policy more aggressively than the markets currently anticipate,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

113,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 04, 2015 09:01AM ET</span>",Unemployment Lowest Since 2008,"By Jessica Menton -

U.S. employers added 173,000 jobs in August, less than widely expected, but the unemployment rate still edged down to 5.1 percent, its lowest level since April 2008, the Labor Department said Friday. Meanwhile, wage growth - which has been stagnant for years -- edged up slightly more than anticipated to 2.2 percent.
Somewhat troubling, though, the labor force participation rate continues to drop, which indicates more Americans giving up on finding work.
The report was forecast to show employers adding 220,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was expected to fall to at 5.2 percent, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Even so, amid the recent stock market turmoil and concerns of a slowing global economy, economists question whether the U.S. is strong enough to move away from crisis-level interest rates. Many economists are still not seeing the accelerated growth that suggests the economy needs to slow -- or that businesses are experiencing wage pressure.
Wages and salaries increased modestly by 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent a year earlier, according the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index.
“Wage growth is still really slow,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes. Two of the Federal Reserve’s major mandates -- employment and inflation -- are still off of the Federal Reserve’s target, North explained. “This argues against the central bank raising rates this month,” he said.
The Federal Reserve's Next Moves
Friday's jobs report is the last monthly unemployment reading ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Sept. 16-17. The financial markets reacted with mixed emotions to the July numbers because the report didn’t completely solidify whether the Fed would actually hike rates in September, or hold off until later.
With the unemployment rate falling to the lowest level since April 2008, it could offer further evidence the U.S. economy is on strong enough footing to absorb the impact of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, which many economists had expected in September. The upward adjustment would be the first in nearly a decade. Interest rates remain at historic lows since the financial crisis in 2008.
However, in the midst of the recent stock market turmoil over China’s slowing economy, part of the Fed’s consideration not to raise rates will be global unease. “While China has slowed, its implications are still making financial markets nervous,” said William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO.
Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief at Bankrate.com, agrees. “The consensus has definitely shifted from early August,” Hamrick said, explaining the majority of economists are now looking for the Fed to delay at this month’s meeting. Toughly 40 percent expecting the Fed to lift in September and the 60 percent looking for October and beyond, Hamrick said, citing a Bankrate.com survey.
The U.S. had previously added at least 200,000 jobs per month for 12 consecutive months following February’s strong jobs report, a feat not seen in 20 years. However, the reports over the last two quarters haven’t been as stellar.
“Job growth has tapered greatly in the last three months,” said Spriggs. “My hope is the Fed will look at the numbers and say they still need more information before making a decision”
Participation Rate Remains Near 40-Year Low
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month, at 2.2 million, constituting 27.7 percent of the unemployed. Meanwhile, many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full time, and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest proportion opting out of the workforce since the 1970s.
Unemployment Rate vs Labor Force Participation Rate | StartClass
The labor-force participation rate remains at its lowest level since October 1977, a 38-year low. That rate fell to 62.6 percent from the prior month, according to the report released Friday.
The participation rate still hovers at a nearly 40-year low because improvements in the labor market are being offset by the structural headwinds of demographic change: Baby boomers are retiring and young professionals are going back to school.
Energy Job Losses
To be sure, pockets of the U.S. job market are suffering. The energy industry has been hit hard of late. The precipitous drop in oil prices over the last year has led to job losses related to the oil and mining sector as investment in those areas declines. And economists expect the job losses to continue.
In August, employment in mining fell for the seventh month in a row. Since a recent high in December 2014, employment in mining has declined by 90,000, with losses concentrated in support activities for mining."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ""flight to safety"" into bonds many expected when U.S. stocks slumped last week never took off, making big losers out of prominent fund managers and further confusing investors at a volatile time in the market.
Stocks plunged in the second half of August, largely on fears of China's worsening economy, but U.S. Treasury yields did not see the kind of safety bid that many were expecting and has been typical in times of stock-market stress in the past. 
Strategists link the lack of a move to bonds to a number of events: Hawkish rhetoric from Fed officials even as the equity market stumbled; a bout of selling by hedge funds that had expected a rally in the bond market that they didn't get; and bond sales by central banks in China and other emerging market economies trying to protect their currencies from depreciating.
Reduced appetite from overseas, along with the outlook for the Fed, will be crucial in coming weeks if equities fall again and bonds don't respond. The Fed decision on September 17 could mark the first rate increase in almost a decade, and uncertainty surrounding that decision is likely to keep many in the bond market on the sidelines.
""The correlation between bonds and stocks is more situational now because it's the central banks calling the shots,"" said Robert Vanden Assem, head of developed markets investment grade fixed-income at PineBridge Investments in New York.    
During the recent U.S. stock market sell-off in the third week of August, for instance, the S&P 500 (SPX) dropped 9 percent, but U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, fell by only 12 basis points. 
That's not typical. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), the relationship between stocks and bonds that has held since 2009 suggests 10-year yields should have declined by 22 basis points. 
Bond yields since then have drifted higher and buying interest has been minimal. The lack of a rally in the U.S. Treasury market made big losers out of notable hedge funds, including Bridgewater Associates' All-Weather Fund, which fell 4.2 percent in August.
These funds borrowed heavily to augment their returns, but as things became turbulent, that leverage generated losses that forced them to wind down that borrowing.
Strategists say part of what kept Treasury yields from reflexively falling through a run to safe-haven debt were hawkish signals from the Fed, particularly Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. 
At last week's central bank gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, several Fed officials, including Fischer, seemed to boost the odds on a rate increase if not in September, then certainly in December. The message the Fed delivered over the weekend came between a Friday and Monday that saw the U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 lose 7 percent of its value.
Leading brokerages, including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America, commented that though it's a close call, the odds favor an increase in the next few weeks.
""Unless the U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, the bond market is likely to keep yields relatively firm,"" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, even if the S&P 500 falls in the weeks ahead on concern about growth in China and other emerging market economies, he said.
Interest rate futures this week saw a more than 50 percent chance of a rate hike in December  and a 28 percent probability in September , according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
If that happens, bonds won't look as attractive. Higher interest rates diminish the value of an investor's bond holdings, resulting in lower portfolio returns.
""Treasuries have been a good diversifier to portfolios, but their benefit as a diversifier has been reduced because yields are already extremely low and the Fed is starting to normalize rates,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock in New York.
    
CHINA, CURRENCY INTERVENTIONS
Further supporting yields on U.S. Treasuries was the sell-off in reserves by China and other emerging market economies to shore up their slumping economies. U.S. Treasuries represent the bulk of the Chinese and emerging market reserves.
Fears over weakened growth prospects and plunging commodity prices in some emerging markets have taken a toll on their currencies. As China sold currency reserves in recent months, real yields have moved higher since the beginning of the year, while inflation expectations have declined.
China and emerging markets led the build-up in global foreign exchange reserves following the 1997 Asian crisis to a peak of $12 trillion last year. This cash pile shielded them from the 2007-08 crisis, and it looks as if it is once again being deployed.
It's not clear whether China has sold U.S. Treasuries over the last month, or if so, how much. Bank of America Merrill Lynch speculated in a research note that if China sold between $7 billion to $10 billion a day of U.S. Treasuries in the three weeks since the Chinese yuan devaluation on Aug. 11, it might have dumped as much as $150 billion in U.S. government bonds. 
These are large numbers given the fact that the total net issuance of Treasuries this year will only be about $500 billion, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in its research note. As of June 2015, China held $1.27 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, according to capital flows data from the U.S. Treasury Department.

""The presence of central banks within our markets is over-riding and it's all-encompassing and has driven the activity since 2008,"" said PineBridge's Vanden Assem.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global manufacturing and service sector activity expanded in August at the same pace as in July, with both the U.S. and euro zone doing better than Asia, according to purchasing manager surveys. 
""Scratching beneath the headline numbers, however, reveals an ongoing disparity between the relatively strong performance of the developed nations whereas growth in the emerging markets is quite weak,"" said David Hensley, a director at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
JPMorgan's Global All-Industry Output Index, produced with private data vendor Markit, held steady at July's 53.7 last month and has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since October 2012.
Markit's global service sector purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 54.4 in August from 54.1 in July, though on Tuesday the world manufacturing PMI expanded at its weakest pace in just over two years last month. 
""The trend in key regions such as Asia will need to improve if global growth in 2015 is to exceed its 2014 outcome,"" Hensley said.
The global PMIs combine survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.
U.S. SERVICE SECTOR EXPANDS
In regional data, U.S. service sector growth in August reached its highest level since May, signaling good third-quarter economic growth. 
Markit's final service sector PMI for August improved to 56.1 from 55.7 in July, but average prices charged by U.S. service businesses fell to end 25 straight months of increases.
""Inflationary pressures have abated, which will help the argument that interest rate hikes can be delayed,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. 
An alternative survey from the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also showed service sector growth remained robust during August but was off a 10-year peak reached in July. The ISM service sector PMI fell to 59 last month from 60.3 in July. 
Elsewhere in the Americas, activity in Brazil's services sector fell for the sixth straight month in August, but contracted at a slower pace than in July, according to HSBC/Markit. 
The more modest contraction, combined with a downturn in the manufacturing sector, lifted HSBC's Composite PMI to 44.8 in August from 40.8 in July, but nevertheless suggested Brazil's recession may have deepened in recent months. 
""This bodes ill for the Brazilian economy, which will likely see further declines in activity in upcoming months,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, an economist with Markit.
EURO ZONE PICTURE BRIGHTER
Business activity in the euro zone accelerated at its fastest pace in more than four years in August, according to surveys that highlighted a divergence between laggard France and the other big economies in the currency bloc.
While generally upbeat, the set of surveys still point only to modest third-quarter economic growth of about 0.4 percent in July-September, according to Markit.
""The upwards momentum that the euro zone economy had has started to fizzle out, and growth no longer seems to be accelerating,"" said Nick Kounis, head of macro and markets research at ABN AMRO. 
Markit's euro zone service sector PMI rose to 54.4 from July's 54.0, after the manufacturing PMI, released on Tuesday, dipped to 52.3 from 52.4. 
Markit's final August Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.3, its highest level since May 2011. It has now been above 50 since July 2013.
Italian firms had their best performance since early 2011 and German growth strengthened. It was a different story in France, the bloc's second biggest economy, where the composite PMI slumped to its lowest since the start of the year.
On Thursday the European Central Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts, warning of possible further trouble from China. At the same time, the euro zone central bank pledged to beef up or prolong its economic stimulus if needed, which helped global stock markets rally.
August was disappointing for the British economy too with the Markit/CIPS PMI for the service sector recording its weakest growth since May 2013, just as the Bank of England is considering when to start to raise interest rates. 
""Let's face it, August was not a pretty month and a number of downside events will have weighed down on business sentiment and activity,"" said Kallum Pickering at Berenberg Bank.
JAPAN IMPROVES, CHINA STILL A WORRY 
Activity in Japan's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in almost two years in August, easing concerns about economic growth after disappointing industrial production and household spending data for July.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services PMI which rose to 53.7, the highest since October 2013, from 51.2 in July. 
Japan's economy contracted in April-June as exports and consumer spending weakened. The government is counting on a return to growth in the current quarter to fulfill its pledge to revitalize the economy. 
India's service sector grew for a second month in August, keeping pressure on the central bank for another rate cut to bolster a slowing economy. India's Nikkei/Markit services PMI rose to 51.8 in August from 50.8. 
Economists remain concerned about China, where PMI data earlier this week from Ciaxin/Markit showed activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors slowing. Chinese stock markets, the source of much of the global volatility in recent weeks, were closed for a two-day holiday starting Thursday.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2015 11:39AM ET</span>",Shrinking U.S. trade gap shows economy's underlying strength,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid concerns about a global growth slowdown.
While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits, the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a strengthening labor market. Activity in the vast services sector also hovered at a 10-year high in August.
""There is little evidence that the abrupt deterioration in financial market conditions and the heightened concerns about the global economy have begun to affect the U.S. economy,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion from $59.0 billion in the prior month.
The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade added 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.
Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries over China's economy.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after the data. Investor sentiment also was boosted after the European Central Bank indicated it could prolong its monetary stimulus program. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ended Aug. 29.
The claims data has no bearing on Friday's closely watched employment report for August as it fell outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising 215,000 in July. 
But job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.
EYES ON FED
The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting meeting. There is speculation the U.S. central bank could raise interest rates at that meeting.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week. 
It was the 23rd straight week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
A third report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its services industry index slipped to 59 last month from a reading of 60.3 in July, which was the highest since August 2005. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
Fifteen out of 18 service industries, including real estate, construction and retail trade, reported an expansion in activity - the most since October. Only mining reported a contraction.
""The domestic economy is holding strong. The Fed must weigh this against the prospects of a weakening global economy as they decide whether to raise interest rates in two weeks,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. 
The strong services sector should help offset the drag on the economy from manufacturing, which has been hit by a strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies.
But the buoyant dollar's negative impact on the economy is starting to ease. Exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion in July, the first rise since April. There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose. 
Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion, led by consumer goods such as pharmaceuticals and cell phones. However, automobile imports were the highest on record and the value of crude oil imports was the highest since January. 
Soft import growth is usually associated with sluggish domestic demand. The weakness, however, is probably related to a slowdown in inventory accumulation as businesses try to whittle down a huge stockpile of merchandise accumulated in the first half of 2015. 
The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit was $31.6 billion in July, up 0.4 percent from June. That trade gap will be closely watched in the coming months in the wake of China's recent devaluation of its currency.
Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose.
Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However, automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods fell in July.
Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.
Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil were the lowest since February 2010.
Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

135,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 03, 2015 08:31AM ET</span>",European Central Bank Keeps Interest Rate Steady,"By Cristina Silva -

Amid threats of a Chinese slowdown, the European Central Bank voted Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping the refinancing rate at 0.05 percent and the marginal lending rate at 0.3 percent. The decision came as the world's oldest central bank - Sweden's Riksbank - also said it would leave its main interest rate unchanged.
""There are few signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, and the country's stock market is not so connected to the activity on the ground,"" the European Central Bank's vice president, Vitor Constancio, said last week.
The European Central Bank began an unprecedented stimulus program earlier this year that saw unemployment shrink and inflation back above zero. But in recent days, a slowdown in China and other emerging markets has seen a shaky stock market in Europe.
The Economist Intelligence Unit predicted bank President Mario Draghi would announce Thursday an extension of the bank's bond-buying program. ECB Executive Board Member Peter Praet said last week the bank was flexible. ""The ECB is ready to expand or extend its QE [quantitative easing] program if needed, as a slump on commodity prices and risks to global growth threaten it's inflation goal of 2 percent,"" he said.
European investors celebrated Thursday a jump in eurozone private sector growth last month. The FTSE 100 was up by 103 points, or 1.7 percent, while Germany’s DAX grew by 1.8 percent. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the eurozone should be able to achieve reasonable growth over the next year amid a Chinese slowdown."

The ECB said it was maintaining its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.05%, in line with market expectations. The central bank also held its marginal lending at 0.30% and left its deposit facility rate unchanged at -0.20%.
ECB President Mario Draghi was to comment on the decision at a press conference at 1:30PM London time, or 8:30AM ET.
Draghi could hint at the possibility of further monetary stimulus with inflation in the euro area still sluggish and as fears linger about slowing global growth led by China.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.7 from 51.2 in July to reach the highest since October 2013.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers maintained a steady pace of hiring in August despite recent global financial market turmoil, suggesting that labor market momentum likely remains strong enough for the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate hike this year.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased 190,000 last month. While that was below economists' expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs, it was a step-up from the 177,000 positions created in July and in line with the trend for the first seven months of this year.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for August due on Friday.
""Businesses are still hiring, but it is not clear if Friday's report will give the Fed either an 'all-clear' or a 'let's go slow' signal,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 220,000 jobs in August after rising 215,000 in July. There is, however, a risk of a weaker number as the first print of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.
But some economists were encouraged by the ADP report, which showed job gains in all sectors, except in the energy industry.
""ADP does not show the same initial under-reporting bias in the initial release of the August data as payroll data from the government appear to display,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
""This apparent consistent trend in ADP payroll gains would reassure us that the trend in employment was little changed in August in the event that payroll growth drops noticeably below 200,000 in Friday's report.""
The unemployment rate is forecast to tick down one-tenth of a percentage point to a near 7-1/2-year low of 5.2 percent. The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Fed's Sept. 16-17 policy meeting.
The chances of an interest rate hike this month have been diminished by a global stock market sell-off in the wake of poor economic data from China. In addition, U.S. factory activity slowed to a more than two-year low in August, with some economists citing the financial markets turbulence as a factor.
However, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC last week it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout had made a rate hike this month less compelling.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street rebounded from Tuesday's sharp losses. 
STRONG DOMESTIC ACTIVITY
In August, manufacturing payrolls increased 7,000 after rising only 1,000 in July, the ADP report showed. The construction industry added 17,000 jobs in August on top of 15,000 jobs in July. Services industry employment increased by 173,000 jobs in August following a gain of 170,000 in July.
Separately, the Fed's Beige Book showed the economy continued to expand from July to mid-August, though some manufacturing firms said the growth slowdown in China was having a modest effect on activity.
""Outside of manufacturing, the domestic activity data is very strong,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""But Fed officials are clearly worried about an economic slowdown in China, commodity prices are lower, and there is little evidence of any marked pick-up in either wage growth or core inflation.""
In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity increased at its strongest pace in 1-1/2 years in the second quarter, keeping wage inflation subdued for now.
The government revised productivity to show it rising at a 3.3 percent annual rate, the quickest since the fourth quarter of 2013, instead of the 1.3 percent pace reported last month. 
But the trend in productivity remains weak. Productivity rose 0.7 percent from a year ago instead of the 0.3 percent increase reported last month. 
Growth in productivity is an important determinant of the economy's non-inflationary speed limit. Though the second-quarter bounce back is dampening wage pressure for now, the weak trend in productivity suggests the economy's growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent pace that economists have been estimating.
That would imply the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflation
pressures may take hold a little bit faster than had been
anticipated.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 1.4 percent rate in the second quarter, rather than increasing at a 0.5 percent rate as previously reported.
Unit labor costs rose 1.7 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014. 
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for U.S. factory goods rose for a second straight month in July on strong demand for automobiles, which could help to keep manufacturing supported as it deals with the buoyant dollar and softening global demand.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 2.2 percent rise in June.
Factory activity has been hobbled by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand is also hurting manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy.
A report on Tuesday showed the manufacturing industry braked to a more than two-year low in August, with some economists blaming the slowdown on the recent global stock market sell-off.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.9 percent in July after a previously reported 1.8 percent increase in June.
The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinationals.
Orders for transportation equipment rose 5.5 percent in July as bookings for motor vehicles and parts increased 4.0 percent, the largest gain in a year. Orders for automobiles are likely to remain strong after sales surged in August.
In July, there were increases in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computers and electronic products.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – increased 2.1 percent instead of the 2.2 percent rise reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.6 percent in July, unchanged from last month's estimate.
Inventories of factory goods slipped 0.1 percent after three straight months of gains. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, unchanged from June.

That suggests manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters. Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.2 percent, increasing for a second straight month.

Australia’s economy reported its slowest growth rate in over two years with gross domestic product growing only 0.2 percent in the second quarter, according to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wednesday. A slowdown in mining and construction coupled with lower exports contributed to the low growth for the period covering three months ending in June.
The statistics bureau reported that mining production was down by three percent this quarter contributing to the drop in exports. Mining related construction was also down. Overall mining production for the export rich nation was still positive for the year at 2.1 percent.
Australian GDP Growth Over Time | FindTheData
News of the economy’s performance drove the Australian dollar down below 70 U.S. cents for the first time in six years before making a slight recovery, according to ABC News Australia. The figures were worse than expected by experts after Australia experienced 0.9 percent growth in the last quarter.
Australian media reported that along with a weak first quarter in 2013, this was the worst growth experienced since 2011 when the country was still recovering from the economic crisis of 2008 and was hit by flooding in Queensland. Experts now fear that Australia could face a recession.
The Wall Street Journal reported that before the data was released, Australian businesses were already planning to cut back on spending plans. Several economists told the Wall Street Journal that it was possible that Australia’s central bank would again cut interest rates.
“Australia’s growth slowdown could bring rate cuts back on the agenda,” said Daniel Martin, a senior economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.
The health, transport and finance industries contributed 0.1 percentage points each to the growth in GDP, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Bureau noted that the domestic demand from household and government consumption were among the positive contributions to GDP growth."

Growth for American factories hit its lowest level since May 2013, according to a report issued on Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), a trade group focused on supply management. The report said that the purchasing managers’ index, which reflects manufacturing, slid to 51.1 percent in August from 52.7 percent in July.
The numbers run counter to the improvement that economists had been expecting in August, according to the Associated Press. China’s economic slowdown, declining crude oil prices and a strong U.S. dollar have all contributed to the slower pace of American manufacturing growth. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar has made American goods more expensive on international markets.
The six industries that reported contractions were apparel, leather and allied products; primary metals; electrical equipment, appliances and components; petroleum and coal products; computer and electronic products; and transportation equipment, according to the report. Ten of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in August, according to the report.
The report also said that growth of raw material inventories decreased by one percentage point from July to 48.5 percent for August. The prices for raw materials dropped for the 10th month in a row.
Bradley Holcomb, chairman of ISM’s manufacturing survey committee, told the AP that global market fluctuations impact American manufacturing. “China, in the same fashion, does impact us both emotionally and directly,” he said.
The impact of China’s economic uncertainty could hit American manufacturing into next year, experts said. In an interview with MarketWatch, economist Joshua Shapiro noted that the August results raise a warning flag about real economic growth, ""particularly should the weakness be sustained in September.”
Overall, the American economy grew for the 75th month in a row, according to the report. U.S. unemployment stands at 5.3 percent, a seven-year low. The AP reported that the U.S. Commerce Department said the American economy grew 3.7 percent from April to June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity braked to a more than two-year low in August, but sturdy gains in automobile sales and construction spending suggested the economy remained on solid footing.
The sharp slowdown in manufacturing, which has been hurt by a strong dollar and deep spending cuts in the energy sector, was probably an early indication of fallout from the recent turmoil in stock markets, economists said.
And it could bolster the case against the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later this month, they said. 
""It suggests that the recent eruption in uncertainty toward Chinese and global growth is beginning to affect U.S. business decisions,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""We look for the Fed to take a pass on raising rates this month as they continue to assess the incoming economic data for any evidence of fallout.""
Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC last week it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout had made a rate hike this month less compelling. The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee meets Sept. 16-17.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Tuesday its national factory activity index fell to 51.1 last month, the lowest reading since May 2013, from 52.7 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.
The ISM's new orders subindex fell 4.8 percentage points to 51.7, also the lowest level since May 2013. The employment index slipped to 51.2 last month from a reading of 52.7 in July. The weak employment reading suggests a moderation in factory payroll gains in August.
Ten out of 18 manufacturing industries, including machinery and furniture, reported growth last month. Six industries, including apparel, primary metals, and computer and electronic products, said activity had contracted.
The weakness also was corroborated by a separate report from financial data firm Markit, which showed its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index falling to a near two-year low of 53.0 in August from a reading of 53.8 in July. 
DOLLAR DRAG 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been under pressure from a strong dollar, which has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
A more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices since June of last year has led to deep spending cuts in the energy sector. Despite these constraints, U.S. factories are performing better relative to their global peers.
Data on Tuesday showed China's giant manufacturing industry contracted last month at its fastest pace in three years and euro zone factory growth eased.
The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the manufacturing data, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. Stocks on Wall Street ended down nearly 3 percent, pushing all three major U.S. indexes firmly into losses for the year.
The slowdown in manufacturing and its impact on the economy is likely to be blunted by strong domestic demand. Auto sales increased to a seasonally adjusted pace of 17.8 million units in August, the strongest since July 2005, according to Autodata Corp. That was up from a pace of 17.55 million units in July. 
The six largest automakers in the U.S. market all beat the sales forecasts of industry analysts as consumers continued to buy pickup trucks and SUVs.
Auto sales are one of the earliest and most reliable indicators of consumer spending. Last month's increase suggested the stock market swoon was not yet weighing on consumption. 
""The U.S. economy continues to move forward. Manufacturing is slowing, but domestic demand remains strong,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With families buying houses as well, we should see an upturn in the demand for manufacturing goods that go into building those products.""   
The economy, which grew at a 3.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter, is also getting a boost from the construction sector. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are currently above a 2.5 percent rate. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.7 percent to $1.08 trillion in July, the highest level since May 2008. It also rose 0.7 percent in June.

Construction spending has increased for eight straight months and was up 13.7 percent compared to July of last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - China's giant manufacturing industry contracted and euro zone and U.S. growth eased in August in data published on Tuesday, while the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for world growth this year. 
Stocks on major markets tumbled along with commodity prices following the data, with markets still trying to gauge the likelihood of a September interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. 
""It's all consistent with a global economy which clearly is struggling to make any significant headway,"" said economist Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (XETRA:CBKG).
""As a consequence central banks which are thinking about raising interest rates in the near future will be looking at these numbers and it will maybe give them a little pause for thought.""
Global factory activity expanded at its weakest pace since July 2013 in August, with JPMorgan's Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, produced with Markit, sinking to 50.7 from 51.0 in July. 
August was the 33rd straight month the index has been above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. The global PMI indicator combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.
""The August PMI surveys suggest that conditions in the global manufacturing sector remain relatively lacklustre, with growth staying stubbornly below its long-run trend,"" said David Hensley, a director at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Global economic growth is likely to be weaker than earlier expected, the head of the IMF said on Tuesday, due to a slower recovery in advanced economies and a further slowdown in emerging nations.
CHINA MANUFACTURING CONTRACTS AGAIN
Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace in three years in August, according to official data, reinforcing fears of a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy despite a flurry of government support measures.
The Chinese government's PMI fell to 49.7 in August from the previous month's reading of 50.0, in line with expectations of analysts polled by Reuters.. 
A private survey from Markit/Caixin showed China's factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years last month, with the PMI dropping to 47.3, the lowest since March 2009, from July's 47.8. 
Even China's services sector, which has been one of the few bright spots in the sputtering economy, showed signs of cooling, expanding at its slowest pace in more than a year, Markit said.
""Today's reading suggests that manufacturing activities in China remain weak. We now expect GDP to grow by an annual 6.4 percent in the third quarter,"" ANZ bank economists said.
Indian manufacturing growth slowed, with the Nikkei India manufacturing PMI compiled by Markit at 52.3 from July's 52.7. 
Japanese data went against the trend, with manufacturing growth the strongest in seven months, reinforcing expectations the economy will rebound from a second-quarter contraction. 
In a sign of slowing global demand, exports from South Korea dropped nearly 15 percent in August from a year earlier, with shipments to China, the United States and Europe all weaker, a trend HSBC's Frederic Neumann called worrisome for the global trade cycle.
""The country, after all, has long been a reliable bellwether. Korea's PMI is still negative, and new export orders again contracted, even if at a less rapid pace than before,"" Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research, said.
ECB TO EXTEND ASSET BUYING?
Euro zone manufacturing growth eased in August, adding to the ECB's woes as it battles to spur expansion and inflation with an asset purchase program. 
Markit's final manufacturing PMI for the euro zone was 52.3 last month, down from 52.43 in July, though it has been above the 50 mark for over two years.
The disappointing readings come almost half a year after the ECB began pumping 60 billion euros a month of fresh cash into the economy and a day after official data showed inflation in the 19-country bloc at just 0.2 percent.
In one bright spot, euro zone unemployment unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in more than three years in July, official data showed.
However, a two-year spell of jobs growth across British factories came to an end last month as manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace, suggesting the sector is unlikely to boost economic growth much there this quarter. 
""Sterling's appreciation and the continued sluggishness of the euro zone economy's recovery suggest that a sustained revival in the export-orientated manufacturing sector will remain a distant prospect,"" said Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics.
U.S. GROWTH SLOWS, CANADA CONTRACTS
Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed to its weakest in almost two years in August, with the Markit PMI falling to 53.0 in August, down from 53.8 in July. 
""August's survey highlights that the U.S. manufacturing sector continues to struggle under the weight of the strong dollar and heightened global economic uncertainty, but resilient domestic spending and subdued cost pressures are keeping the recovery on track,"" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit.
""Reflecting this, new orders from abroad have now fallen in four of the past five months, which represents the weakest phase of manufacturing export performance since late 2012.""
A reading from the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also showed U.S. factory activity growth slowing in August, with its PMI at 51.1 from 52.7.
Canada's factory activity contracted in August, with the Markit/RBC PMI falling to a 49.4 from 50.8 in July. 
In other data on Tuesday, Canada's economy shrank at an annualized 0.5 percent rate in the second quarter, putting the country in recession for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis with cheaper oil prices taking a toll. 

Brazil's Markit/HSBC PMI fell further in August to 45.8 from 47.2 in July. Brazil's economy shrank 1.9 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months, government data showed on Friday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy shrank again in the second quarter, putting the country in recession for the first time since the financial crisis, with a plunge in oil prices taking a toll as business investment fell and inventory accumulation slowed.
Gross domestic product contracted at an annualized 0.5 percent rate in the second quarter, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday. That was better than forecast, though revisions showed the first quarter's contraction was steeper than first reported.
Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically considered the textbook definition of a recession. The confirmation of a modest recession is likely to figure heavily into the election campaign as Canadians head to the polls next month.
Some economists and members of the Conservative government have argued that such a definition is too narrow and that other economic measures should be taken into account, such as unemployment, which has remained relatively subdued.
Encouragingly, the economy grew in June for the first time in six months, suggesting the recession may be short-lived. While the price of oil and other natural resources have weakened since June, many expect non-commodity Canadian exports to benefit from a strengthening U.S. economy.

""Despite the technical recession materializing, it does look like the Canadian economy is jumping back, is rebounding strongly in the third quarter,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
The last time Canada was in recession was in 2008-09, when the U.S. housing market meltdown triggered a global credit crisis.
In the second quarter, Canadian business investment sank by an annualized 7.9 percent as spending on non-residential structures, machinery and equipment fell. Inventory accumulation slowed by C$4.91 billion ($3.74 billion).
Activity in the goods-producing industries declined 2 percent on a quarterly basis, with a 4.5 percent drop in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction component. But a rebound in that same sector helped the economy perk up by a better-than-expected 0.5 percent in June.
Following the data, traders saw a slightly lower probability the central bank will cut rates again next week. The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year in an effort to revive the economy.

""They'll wait and see how the third quarter's unfolding to get more information,"" said Burleton. ""But it does look like the weakness in the first half is in the rear view mirror.""

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Activity in China's factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in at least three years in August as domestic and export orders tumbled, hitting global markets and increasing fears that the world's second-largest economy may be heading for a hard landing.
Even more worrying, China's services sector, which has been one of the lone bright spots in the sputtering economy, also showed signs of cooling.
News of deteriorating business conditions set off fresh selling in Chinese shares on Tuesday, with the main indexes tumbling 5 percent at one point before recovering some of the day's losses by the close.
World stocks and commodity prices also took a hit. [MKTS/GLOB]
Hurt by soft demand, overcapacity and falling investment, China's economy has been further buffeted by plunging shares and a shock yuan devaluation, in what some have called a ""perfect storm"" of factors that is rattling global markets and could strain relations with China's major trading partners.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday it would be beneficial for this week's meeting of the Group of 20 major economies to discuss what is going on in China's economy.
""Capital market turmoil has made Chinese businesses and consumers turn more cautious,"" Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh, said in reference to a 40 percent plunge in Chinese shares since mid-June.
Adams said China's economy could grow around 6.5 percent in the second-half of the year, easing to 6.2 percent in 2016. Some analysts believe growth levels are already well below that, putting Beijing's official target of 7 percent at risk.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.7 in August from 50.0 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That was in line with a Reuters poll, but the lowest since August 2012, and below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction.
New orders - a proxy for domestic and foreign demand - fell to 49.7 in August from July's 49.9. New export orders contracted for an 11th straight month.
A private survey by Caixin/Markit focusing on smaller factories pointed to an even sharper cooldown, with the PMI dropping to 47.3, the worst reading since March 2009.
Both surveys showed manufacturers were laying off workers at a faster rate as their order books shrank.
Analysts said the bleak readings affirmed bets that China, which has slashed interest rates five times since November, must loosen policy again soon to avert a sharper economic downturn that could weigh on global growth even as the U.S. central bank prepares to raise interest rates.
The closure of factories in northern China to clear Beijing's skies for a huge military parade this week likely also hurt output, as did a giant blast in the port city of Tianjin.
SERVICES FIRMS LOSING STEAM
China's services companies are also showing clear signs of fatigue, to the point where growth in that sector may no longer be enough to offset persistent factory weakness.
The official services reading cooled slightly to 53.4, while remaining well in expansion territory, but the private survey PMI fell sharply to 51.5, its lowest level since July 2014.
That dragged a composite PMI combining factory and services readings to below 50 for the first time since April 2014.
In another sign that economic weakness was spreading to the services sector, the Caixin/Markit services PMI showed the labor market deteriorated for the 22nd straight month in August. Employment in the services sector fell to 50.1.
""We believe further aggressive monetary easing and proactive fiscal policy, along with financial liberalization, are needed to maintain growth at around 7 percent,"" ANZ economists said.
A flurry of earnings reports from top Chinese banks in the past week showed they were struggling with the slowest profit growth in at least six years and a jump in bad loans, and the slump in stock markets in recent weeks is likely to reduce contributions from the financial sector in coming months.
""Recent volatility in global financial markets could weigh on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling,"" said He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said the impact of gyrating stocks on the broader economy should be contained.
""China is a developing country. The invented economy also has a great impact on the real economy, but the impact is not as big as in developed countries,"" Ning told a news briefing. ""As for volatility, which industry doesn't have volatility?""
Several leading Chinese brokerages said on Tuesday they would increase the size of their proprietary stock trading, answering Beijing's call for listed firms to bolster support for struggling stocks.
Chinese authorities have launched their most aggressive policy loosening campaign since the 2008/09 global financial crisis to try to put a floor beneath sagging growth.

But the effectiveness of more monetary policy easing has been called into question, with some warning of a ""liquidity trap"" if China continues to pour cash into a system where the last thing struggling companies want is to take on more debt.

Construction spending increased 0.7 percent to $1.08 trillion, the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. June's outlays were revised up to show a 0.7 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain.
Construction spending has increased for eight straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction outlays rising 0.6 percent in July. Construction spending was up 13.7 percent compared to July of last year.
The report rounded off a month of solid data that suggested the economy had retained much of its strength from the second quarter, when it expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace. July data for consumer spending, industrial production, business spending, housing and employment painted a fairly upbeat picture of the economy.
Construction spending in July was buoyed by a 1.3 percent jump in private construction spending to the highest level since April 2008. Spending on private non-residential construction projects surged 1.5 percent to the highest level since October 2008.
Massive capital investment cuts in the energy sector in response to the past year's plunge in crude oil prices have undercut spending on non-residential structures. However, nonresidential construction spending excluding the oil and gas sector rose sharply in the second quarter. Spending on private residential construction increased 1.1 percent in July to a near 7-1/2-year high, reflecting gains in home building.

Public construction outlays, however, fell 1.0 percent. Spending on state and local government projects, which is the largest portion of the public sector segment, dropped 1.1 percent. Federal government outlays rose 0.9 percent.

177,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 01, 2015 09:30AM ET</span>",Canada May Enter Technical Recession,"By Elizabeth Whitman -

Canada’s economy shrank at an annualized pace of 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Because Canada's gross domestic product, or GDP, fell at a rate of 0.6 percent in the first quarter, the ongoing slowdown would mark a technical recession for Canada, its first in four years. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
Other sources reported the predicted contraction as being slightly greater than 0.9 percent. Statistics Canada was expected to report that the country’s economy contracted at an annualized rate of 1 percent in the second quarter, the Canadian Press reported. But the possible recession was framed as a brief one, despite falling energy prices.
""A number of positive elements are coming through,"" Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD Bank, said, the Canadian Press reported. ""Even if, like we're expecting, we get a contraction in the second quarter, the consumption numbers are likely to be fairly healthy.""
Canada’s vast array of natural resources constitute nearly 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and are linked directly or indirectly to 1.8 million jobs, according to the government site Natural Resources Canada. Canada is one of the top five natural gas and crude oil-producing countries in the world. It also produces potash, uranium, aluminum and other valuable metals and minerals.
As a result, the recent drop in energy prices has taken a toll on Canada. Most recently, after a major decline in Chinese stock markets Aug. 24 sparked worldwide concerns about economic turmoil, oil prices fell to a six-year low last week, though they have since begun to rise again. China is the world’s second-largest consumer of oil, and its reduced demand could spell troubles for oil-producing countries, especially as the 12 countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the cartel frequently known as OPEC, have so far refused to decrease production despite falling prices.
For Canada, some predictions for the third quarter forecast economic growth, ranging from 2 to 2.5 percent, according to TD bank, or 1.5 percent, according to the Bank of Canada. Others are less optimistic.

Unemployment in the eurozone fell to its lowest level in over three years, even as the region’s stock markets continued to reflect the global turmoil caused by economic troubles in China. According to data released Tuesday by Eurostat -- the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg -- the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the 19-nation bloc was 10.9 percent in July, falling below 11 percent for the first time since February 2012.
However, within the eurozone, huge disparities continue to exist -- with Germany having a record low rate of 4.7 percent and Greece -- which narrowly avoided the much dreaded “Grexit” in July --reporting a 25 percent unemployment rate.
 Eurozone unemployment rates in July 2015, seasonally adjusted.
Also released on Tuesday, the U.K. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the month of August showed a decline of 0.4 points -- to 51.5 from 51.9 in July -- meaning British factories slowed down in the month.
“Export order volumes continue to disappoint, with the sterling exchange rate, weak sales growth to the eurozone and the slowdown in China all having an impact,” Rob Dobson from the survey compiler Markit said, in a statement.
Following the announcement, the pound slipped by half a cent against the U.S. dollar to $1.5339.
The latest figures come after a month of volatile trade in European bourses and just days before the European Central Bank (ECB) is due to hold a crucial meeting in Frankfurt.
Reports suggest that the ECB might extend its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) stimulus program, which has been in place for the past six months, in an attempt to boost the bloc’s modest recovery. The program, which entails the ECB and national central banks of the 19 eurozone nations buying 60 billion euros ($67 billion) of government and corporate bonds every month, is currently scheduled to stay in place until September 2016.
During the meeting, ECB policymakers are also expected to discuss the region’s tepid economic growth -- the eurozone grew at a less-than-expected quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the April-June period -- and the impact of China’s economic slowdown on European markets, which on Tuesday, continued to extend losses after the Asian nation’s weak PMI figures.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced Tuesday that it will continue to hold interest rates at a record low of 2 percent. The decision to hold the cash rate steady -- which was widely expected -- comes amid turmoil in the global economy triggered by China’s decision to devalue the yuan last month.
In its statement released Tuesday, the country’s central bank said that Australia’s terms of trade -- the value of a country’s exports relative to its imports -- were falling and that global financial conditions remain “very accommodative.”
“The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in China and East Asia of late, but stronger U.S. growth. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply, including from Australia,” the bank said, in the statement. “In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending.”
Last month’s bloodbath in the Chinese markets triggered massive sell-offs in most Asian economies as jittery investors rushed to get rid of assets perceived as risky. In Australia, the S&P ASX 200 index posted its worst monthly performance since 2008 -- dropping by over 8.5 percent.
The Australian dollar, which recently hit a six-year low -- dropping below 75 U.S. cents -- was trading slightly higher at 71.5 U.S. cents after the central bank announcement. In the statement, the central bank said that the currency is “adjusting to significant declines in key commodity prices.”
The weak Australian dollar and the already-low cost of credit are expected to fuel investment, spending and exports, which have been hit by the slowdown in the Chinese economy and a weakening yuan.
The RBA had last cut rates in May, when it brought the cash rate down by 0.25 percent in response to sharp falls in commodity prices."

For the full-text release, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in China and east Asia of late, but stronger US growth. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Equity markets have been considerably more volatile of late, associated with developments in China, though other financial markets have been relatively stable. Long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. Overall, global financial conditions remain very accommodative.
In Australia, most of the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues. While growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, it has been accompanied with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet, with domestic inflationary pressures contained. Inflation is thus forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices have moved lower and been more volatile recently, in parallel with developments in global markets. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose in July as households stepped up automobile purchases, offering further evidence of strength in the economy that keeps the door open to a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
While other data on Friday showed consumer sentiment dipped in August, likely as households fretted over a recent stock market sell-off, confidence remained at levels consistent with solid consumer spending growth.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in June.
Spending on long-lasting manufactured goods like automobiles increased 1.1 percent, reversing June's drop. Auto purchases accounted for about half of the rise.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after being flat in June.
""We score this report as a solid adjunct to yesterday's strong GDP report that should encourage members of the Fed's policy-making committee that income and spending fundamentals remain in good shape,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The economy grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter. The consumer spending data was the latest report indicating momentum in the economy as it confronted recent global financial markets turbulence, sparked by concerns over a slowing Chinese economy, which has diminished the chances of an interest rate increase next month.
Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC on Friday that there had been ""a pretty strong case"" for a September lift-off in the central bank's short-term interest rate before the stock markets sell-off. However, he said it was too early to decide whether the turmoil had made a rate hike next month less compelling.
""We're still watching how it unfolds. So I wouldn't want to go ahead and decide right now what the case is: more compelling, less compelling, etcetera,"" said Fischer.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell on Fischer's comments, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks slipped after two days of hefty gains.
INFLATION STILL MUTED
Economists say that underlying strength, also highlighted by a rebound in business spending, buoyant housing and labor markets, gives the economy muscle to weather the fallout from the markets rout.
Muted inflation, however, suggested the Fed could find it difficult to hike rates next month even if financial markets settled down before the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting. Low inflation dominated the discussions at the July 28-29 meeting.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, excluding food and energy rose 1.2 percent in the 12 months through July, the smallest rise since March 2011. This so-called core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It increased 1.3 percent in June and is running below the Fed's 2 percent target.
""While the Fed members should feel good about the economy, they will likely remain queasy about inflation. The Fed's conundrum continues unabated,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 91.9 this month from a reading of 93.1 in July. Still, the index remained at levels consistent with a 2.9 percent growth pace in consumer spending this year.
The survey showed a mild decline in buying intentions for durable goods and an increase in home purchase expectations.
""We continue to see relatively stable buying intentions as a positive for consumer spending activity in the months to come. And as the global equity markets have rebounded, we expect consumer confidence to pick up over the next few months,"" said Cheng Chen, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumer spending should be supported by steady income growth and higher savings. Last month, personal income increased 0.4 percent in July as wages and salaries recorded their largest rise since November 2014.
Income has risen by the same margin for four straight months. Savings increased to a $651.1 billion annual rate from $627.3 billion in June.
""The economy has built up a huge amount of steam to push it forward in the months to come with the substantial cash reserves that consumers are holding,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

219,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 28, 2015 11:01AM ET</span>",British Economy Continues To Grow,"By Lydia Tomkiw -

The British economy grew for the tenth consecutive quarter with the gross domestic product increasing by 0.7 percent, according to figures released Friday by the Office for National Statistics. Exports helped drive the growth rising 3.9 percent over the previous three months.
The statistics released Friday for quarter two cover the period from April to June 2015. Global economic uncertainty following China's “Black Monday,” when the Chinese stock market plunged following the devaluation of the country’s currency with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 1,000 points before slightly recovering, could have an effect going forward for the British economy.
Increases in oil and gas production, household consumption and the service sector have all helped to ensure growth. Government expenditures remained steady for the second quarter at 0.9 percent.
Low oil and food prices have kept inflation at a low level giving British citizens room to spend with household consumption expenditure up by 0.7 percent, the 16th consecutive quarter of increases. Output from hotels and restaurants also increased by 1 percent this quarter.
While trade has helped the British economy continue its growth, growing by 1 percentage point, it’s unclear if it will remain strong. The strength of the British currency is making the country’s goods more expensive abroad at a time of economic uncertainty stemming from China and lower demand in Asia and Europe.
The strong economy has edged the Bank of England toward an interest rate increase, as well as a tighter monetary policy. However, market volatility this week has made the timing of any increase uncertain. Speaking with Bloomberg Television, Liz Martins, an economist at HSBC Bank, underscored that economic volatility this week may slightly push back a decision by the Bank of England.
“There’s been some turmoil and from the market perspective, expectations have been pushed back a bit, but I think it’s possible that some of those expectations have been overdone,” Martins said.
A senior economist at Capital Economics told the Financial Times that low inflation in Britain and wage growth bodes well for the rest of 2015. “The economic recovery will sustain its current pace in the second half of 2015,” said Samuel Tombs."

Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.
The consultancies say monthly auto sales to be reported next Tuesday by major automakers will show a decline of 3.9 percent from a year ago, to 1.52 million vehicles.
This is ""due to a quirk in the calendar"" that pushes results of Labor Day weekend sales into September, JD Power and LMC said. While Labor Day is always in September, automakers normally count that weekend's sales in August results.
The annualized rate of sales for August will be 17.2 million vehicles, and the two consultancies maintained the forecast for 2015 at 17.1 million vehicles.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2015 11:38AM ET</span>",U.S. second-quarter GDP growth revised sharply higher to 3.7 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter on solid domestic demand, showing fairly strong momentum that could still allow the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates this year.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its second GDP estimate for the April-June period. 
The GDP report, which was released in the wake of a global stock market sell-off, should assure investors and cautious Fed officials that the United States is in good shape to weather the growing strains in the world economy.
""The U.S. economy entered the current market turbulence with momentum, which will help it to shrug off the drag from China and other developing economies,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
Concerns over slowing economic growth in China sent global equity markets into a tailspin last week, raising doubts that the U.S. central bank would raise its short-term interest rate next month. Markets have since recouped some of the huge losses.
On Wednesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said that prospects of a September lift-off in the central bank's key lending rate ""seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago."" 
U.S. stocks rose sharply on the GDP data, a day after posting their biggest one-day gain in four years. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies.
""The Fed could certainly hold off until later this year, citing the recent market turmoil, but the economic fundamentals would also justify a small September rate increase,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh.
The upward revisions to second-quarter GDP growth also reflected the accumulation of $121.1 billion worth of inventories, $11.1 billion more than previously estimated. That meant inventories contributed 0.22 percentage point to GDP instead of subtracting 0.08 percentage point as reported last month.
While the huge inventory build will likely weigh on growth in the third quarter, the blow could be softened by rebounding business investment in capital goods. 
Economists had expected that second-quarter GDP growth would be revised to a 3.2 percent rate. The economy grew at a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter. Output expanded 2.2 percent in the first half of the year compared to growth of 1.9 percent during the same period in 2014. 
STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND
Underscoring the solid economic fundamentals, a measure of private domestic demand that excludes trade, inventories and government expenditures rose at a 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter, instead of the previously reported 2.5 percent pace.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.1 percent rate, rather than the 2.9 percent pace reported last month. Consumer spending got off a to brisk start in the third quarter, with retail sales rising solidly in July.
A strong labor market, cheaper gasoline and relatively higher house prices are boosting household wealth, helping to support consumer spending. 
The employment picture was further brightened on Thursday by a separate report from the Labor Department showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Aug. 22.
It was the 25th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
Economists also said they expected the recent stock market rout to have only a limited impact on the economy.
""As long as this is a garden-variety correction, the impact on the U.S. economy should be modest,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. 
The Commerce Department said investment in nonresidential structures was revised to show an increase rather than a contraction, reflecting stronger spending on commercial and healthcare construction. 
Spending on residential construction, which includes brokers' commissions, was raised. More gains are likely this quarter after a third report on Thursday showed an increase in contracts to purchase previously owned homes in July. 
In the second quarter, business spending on equipment was not as weak as initially thought.
The energy sector continued to weigh on growth as it struggles with the lingering effects of deep spending cuts by oil-field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices in the past year. 
Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts plunged at a 68.3 percent rate in the second quarter, the largest decline since the second quarter of 1986.
The trade deficit was smaller than previously reported, adding 0.23 percentage point to GDP growth. 
The GDP report also showed a rebound in after-tax corporate profits, but a strong dollar and lower oil prices remain a constraint.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its

Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase suggested further gains in home resales, which reached an 8-1/2-year high in July. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 1.0 percent last month.
Housing is gaining steam, driven by a tightening labor market. Pending home sales rose 7.4 percent from a year ago.
Contracts increased 4.0 percent in the Northeast and were unchanged in the Midwest. They rose 0.6 percent in the South, but fell 1.4 percent in the West.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.0%.
Pending home sales in June fell by 1.7%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 1.7%.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 7.2% in July, below forecasts for an increase of 8.3% and following a gain of 11.1% in June.
The index has increased year-over-year for 11 consecutive months and is the third highest reading of 2015.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says the housing market began the second half of 2015 on a positive note, with pending sales slightly rising in July.
""Led by a solid gain in the Northeast, contract activity in most of the country held steady last month, which bodes well for existing-sales to maintain their recent elevated pace to close out the summer,"" he said.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Aug. 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
It was the first decline since July 18. Claims for the prior week were unrevised. Economists had forecast claims falling to 274,000 last week.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the data and no states had been estimated.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 272,500 last week. It was the 22nd straight week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 13,000 to 2.27 million in the week ended Aug. 15. The so-called continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed households for the August unemployment rate.

Continuing claims were little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate likely held at a seven-year low of 5.3 percent.

Continuing jobless claims in the week ended August 15 rose to 2.269 million from 2.256 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.250 million.
The four-week moving average was 272,500, an increase of 1,000 from the previous week’s total of 271,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment plans recorded its largest increase in just over a year in July, suggesting the United States was in good shape to withstand growing strains in the global economy.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 2.2 percent last month, the biggest rise since June last year.
""The economy had a tailwind heading into the recent market rout. That tailwind will help to carry us through the turbulent waters that lie ahead,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
July's increase in the so-called core capital goods orders was on top of an upwardly revised 1.4 percent increase in June and marked two straight months of hefty gains. Economists had forecast only a 0.4 percent rise in July after a previously reported 0.9 percent increase in June. 
The report added to employment, industrial production, retail sales, housing and consumer spending data in highlighting the U.S. economy's resilience.
The string of upbeat reports suggests the Federal Reserve could still raise interest rates this year despite a global markets sell-off, triggered by worries over China's slowing economy, and policymakers' concerns about low inflation.
New York Fed President William Dudley said on Wednesday prospects of a September rate hike ""seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago.""
Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with all major indices trading more than 1 percent higher. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. 
DOLLAR, OIL PRICE DRAG
A strong dollar and deep spending cuts in the energy sector have undercut business investment.
 Schlumberger Ltd  (N:SLB), the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider and rival Halliburton (N:HAL) have slashed their capital expenditure budgets for this year following a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil since June last year.
While Wednesday's report and recent data on oil drilling suggest the spending cuts in the energy sector were ebbing, renewed weakness in oil prices suggest a turnaround in business investment will only be gradual. 
In addition, the dollar's 16.8 percent gain versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014 remains a challenge for multinational corporations such as Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG).
Still, the surge in core capital goods orders in July bodes well for economic growth prospects in the third quarter.
""It points to a sharp acceleration in the pace of business capital investment activity in the third quarter and provides some upside risks to our expectation for growth,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate
equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product
measurement, rose 0.6 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in June. 
Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent in June and the upward revision suggests second-quarter GDP could be bumped up when the government publishes it second estimate on Thursday.
June data on business inventories and construction spending have already suggested second-quarter growth could be revised to as high as a 3.4 percent annualized pace from the 2.3 percent rate reported last month. Third-quarter growth estimates are around a 2.8 percent rate. 
A 4.7 percent increase in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters
to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rose 2.0 percent in July.
Transportation was lifted by a 4.0 percent rise in orders for automobiles and parts, as automakers kept most assembly lines running during the summer instead of shutting them down for retooling. That increase offset a 6.0 percent decline in aircraft orders. 

Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.2 percent in July, the largest gain since November, while inventories were unchanged.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence hit a seven-month high in August and new single-family home sales rebounded in July, suggesting underlying strength in the economy that could still allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
Other data on Tuesday showed moderate gains in house prices in June, which should support consumer spending and keep home purchasing affordable, especially for first-time buyers.
""This is evidence of the 'some further improvement' in the economy that the Fed is waiting for to raise rates. They are so close, they need just a little more confirmation,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Conference Board said its consumer index jumped 10.5 points to 101.5 this month, the highest reading since January, amid optimism over the labor market. The survey, however, was conducted before a global equity markets sell-off that began last week, which has diminished the chances of a U.S. rate hike next month.
Although sentiment could retreat in September, economists said any decline was likely to be modest. A strong labor market, lower gasoline prices and an improving housing market also are seen supporting consumer confidence.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the employment report, was the most favorable since January 2008. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in incomes slipped, but fewer anticipated a decline.
""If this upbeat sentiment is sustained, then it could potentially provide a strong platform for a sustained upswing in consumer spending activity, which could provide a strong tailwind for the economic recovery going forward,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales increased 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 507,000 units. Those sales, which account for 8.3 percent of the market, were up 25.8 percent compared to July of last year.
The reports, which added to a steady stream of data that have painted an optimistic picture of the U.S. economy, helped boost U.S. stocks, which enjoyed their biggest rally of the year before surrendering the gains and ending lower.

The prospects of a U.S. rate hike next month already had been dealt a blow before the recent global markets turmoil, with the minutes of the Fed's July 28-29 policy meeting highlighting policymakers' concerns about persistently low inflation. 
""We think that the Fed will not raise rates in September, they need a little time to digest what has happened and we think they will raise in December,"" said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""Prior to Friday, we thought that the Fed would raise rates in September.""

The housing market is gaining steam, with data last week showing home resales jumped to a near 8-1/2-year high in July and groundbreaking on new home building climbing to its highest level since October 2007.
The recovery in the sector, which touches almost all spheres of the economy, is being driven by the tightening labor market. A third report showed the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas in June gained 5.0 percent year-over-year compared to a gain of 4.9 percent in May. 
""If the pace of appreciation stabilizes around current levels, it could provide enough incentive to encourage homeowners to put their homes on the market, while encouraging potential homebuyers back into the market,"" said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura in New York. 
The sturdy housing market is boosting homebuilders.  Toll Brothers  (N:TOL), the largest U.S. luxury home builder, said on Tuesday that orders had risen 16 percent so far in the quarter started in August, outpacing the 12 percent rise in the company's third quarter. 
The Commerce Department said the stock of new houses for sale increased 1.9 percent to 218,000 last month, the highest level since March 2010. Still, supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom.

At July's sales pace it would take 5.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.3 months in June.

The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas in June gained 5.0 percent year over year, a bit quicker than the 4.9 percent rate in May. Economists polled by Reuters had projected a 5.1 percent gain.
Denver, San Francisco, and Dallas again experienced the biggest year-over-year home appreciation among the 20 cities with price increases of 10.2 percent, 9.5 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively. 
""The price gains have been consistent as the unemployment rate declined with steady inflation and an unchanged Fed policy,"" David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.
Housing activities have picked up in recent months. Home resales rose to an annualized rate of 5.6 million units in July, the strongest reading since 2007. Housing construction reached an annualized pace of 1.2 million units with almost two-thirds of the total in single family homes.
While a series of Fed rate increases and a ""full blown bear market"" for stocks would hurt the housing market, one rate hike and a stock market correction will unlikely damage the housing sector, Blitzer said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Worries of a deepening China economic slowdown intensified on Friday after a private survey showed the factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in almost 6-1/2-years in August, hammering global stocks and commodity prices.
The gloomy figure sent investors fleeing for cover in gold and bonds, fearing China's sagging economy would translate into slower global growth and muddy the outlook for the timing of the first U.S. interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
World markets had already been on edge after China's surprise devaluation of the yuan last week and a near-collapse in its stock markets in early summer.
""Uncertainty about China growth is now the main swing factor in markets,"" said Tim Condon, an economist at ING Group in Singapore.
""Today's data reinforced the doubts about global growth."" 
The preliminary Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 47.1 in August, well below a Reuters poll median of 47.7 and down from July's final 47.8.
It was the worst reading since March 2009, in the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth straight one below the 50-point level, which separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
The downdraft from China is rattling economies of its trade-reliant Asian neighbors and prompting many Western companies to reduce investments and look for ways to cut costs.
South Korea, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, said on Friday its exports slumped nearly 12 percent in the first 20 days of August from a year ago.
Taiwan reported on Thursday that its export orders in July fell more than expected, with a 14.1 percent slump in orders from China and smaller declines from Japan and Europe, leaving the United States as the lone bright spot.
While a similar factory survey in Japan pointed to a pick-up in activity there due to stronger domestic demand, policymakers in Tokyo are keenly aware of the dangers if China slows further.
Japanese Economics Minister Akira Amari said on Friday he expects China's government to take steps to prevent its economic slowdown from becoming a global problem. 
The flash PMIs are the earliest activity measure to be released on global economies each month, and are closely followed by investors. Similar surveys are due to be released in Europe and the United States later on Friday, and disappointing readings could spark further market mayhem.
MUDDY WATERS
U.S. stock futures  fell sharply after China's PMI report and most Asian stock markets and the Australian dollar  extended early losses. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (SPX) sank to a more than six-month low on concerns about how China's slowdown would impact U.S. firms' earnings and global growth. 
Analysts still expect the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates later this year, though minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting in July showed policymakers discussed China, Greece's debt crisis and the weak state of the global economy.
WEAKNESS ACROSS THE BOARD
A detailed breakdown of China's PMI survey showed conditions deteriorating on almost every level in August. Factory output sank to a near four-year low as firms laid off more workers, while domestic and export orders fell at a faster rate than in July.
Following three decades of blistering double-digit economic growth, Chinese authorities have had limited success in shoring up activity this year despite four interest rates cuts since November.
Worse, last week's shock 2 percent devaluation in the yuan  and a near-collapse in Chinese shares over the summer that was countered by a massive stock market rescue do not appear to have calmed investor jitters.
The yuan has slid nearly 3 percent since its Aug. 11 devaluation, a fall that some analysts say is too modest to boost Chinese exports, but notable enough to raise fears of competitive currency devaluations between governments.
The speed at which China's economy is losing steam has led some analysts to warn that the government may struggle to meet its official economic growth target of 7 percent this year if it doesn't ratchet up policy support. Growth in China's factory output, retail sales and investment all disappointed in July.
Some economists believe that China's present growth levels could already be closer to half of the 7 percent official figure reported for the second quarter.
With China's economic outlook so murky, some firms say it's best to be cautious and not bet on a turnaround in the near future.
""It's hard to predict what China is doing,"" Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive of global mining and commodities firm  Glencore  (L:GLEN) said this week after reporting a slump in first-half earnings. 

Glencore is cutting its spending plans for this year as China's slowdown contributes to sharp falls in commodity prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose to a near 8-1/2-year high in July and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region picked up this month, fresh signs of steady economic growth that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this year.
While other data on Thursday showed a slight increase in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, the trend remained consistent with strong labor market momentum.
""We continue to expect both economic growth and labor market activity to continue shifting higher, providing the justification for the Fed to begin the normalization in monetary policy in September,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 2 percent to an annual rate of 5.59 million units last month, the highest pace since February 2007. 
Demand for housing is being boosted by a strengthening labor market. But supply remains tight, pushing up home prices and sidelining first-time buyers, who are a key part of a strong housing market. The share of first-time buyers fell to a six-month low of 28 percent last month.
There were 2.24 million unsold previously owned homes on the market in July, down 4.7 percent from a year ago. That pushed the median home price to $234,000, up 5.6 percent from the year-ago period. Although higher prices could curb sales, they are raising equity for many owners and boosting household wealth. 
They also may encourage builders to ramp up construction, further boosting the economy. Housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July.
""The market needs more new homes to be built to continue the momentum, so the trade-up buyers can find their next home and provide inventory for those looking to enter the home buying market,"" said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business activity index increased to 8.3 this month from a reading of 5.7 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. While demand for manufactured goods remained weak, shipments rebounded strongly and employment in the region's factories improved.
National manufacturing activity has been stymied by a strong dollar, weak global demand and the impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector. 
STRONG DATA STREAK
The data added to solid June employment, retail sales and industrial production reports that have suggested the economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter. 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the second quarter. A strengthening economy could encourage Fed officials, who are worried about persistently low inflation, to tighten monetary policy this year. 
Minutes from the Fed's July 28-29 policy meeting published on Wednesday underscored policymakers' concerns about tame price pressures, and economists believe that has raised the bar for a September ""lift-off"" in the central bank's short-term lending rate.
Futures markets on Wednesday trimmed bets for a rate hike next month. 
U.S. stocks fell again on Thursday on worries about global growth, with the housing index (HGX) dropping 1.49 percent. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rallied, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. 
In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended Aug. 15. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 5,500 to 271,500 last week. 
It was the 21st straight week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
The claims data covered the week the government surveyed employers for the non-farm payrolls portion of August's employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,000 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of healthy job gains.
""These data show that companies are, for the most part, holding onto labor and reluctant to lay off workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The data are for the August payroll survey week and suggest that the trend of solid job creation remains intact.""

Payrolls increased by 215,000 in July.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales increased 2 percent to an annual rate of 5.59 million units.
June's sales pace was revised slightly lower to 5.48 million units from the previously reported 5.49 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales falling to a 5.44 million-unit pace last month. Sales were up 10.3 percent from a year ago.
A string of strong reports on the U.S. housing market supports the view that the U.S. economy is building up steam and closing in on the point when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates to keep it from overheating.
The gain in home resales in July was driven by increases in America's South and West, regions that were hit hard by the housing bust of the 2007-09 recession.

Nationwide, the median home price fell slightly from the previous month to $234,000, but was up 5.6 percent from a year earlier. The supply of homes for sale fell slightly in July.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales increased 2.0% to a seasonally adjusted 5.59 million units last month from 5.48 million in June. Analysts had expected existing home sales to fall 0.6% to 5.44 million units in July.
Existing-home sales steadily increased for the third consecutive month in July, while stubbornly low inventory levels and rising prices are likely to blame for sales to first-time buyers falling to their lowest share since January, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says the increase in sales in July solidifies what has been an impressive growth in activity during this year's peak buying season.
""The creation of jobs added at a steady clip and the prospect of higher mortgage rates and home prices down the road is encouraging more households to buy now,"" he said.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending August 15 rose by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 from the previous week’s total of 273,000. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 272,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 24 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose only slightly in July as airline fares recorded their biggest drop since 1995, but tame inflation pressures will probably not discourage the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this year. 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month, with gasoline and food prices increasing marginally. July's rise marked a sixth straight monthly increase.
While inflation remains soft, a strengthening economy, marked by a tightening labor market and a firming housing sector, should give the U.S. central bank confidence it will gradually move toward its 2 percent target, economists said.
""Fed officials made clear that they do not need to see higher inflation before hiking. They just need to have reasonable confidence it will return to mandate,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Most economists have been expecting the Fed to raise its short-term interest rate next month for the first time in almost a decade. 
Futures markets on Wednesday trimmed bets for a September liftoff after minutes of the Fed's July 28-29 meeting showed policymakers remained concerned about weak inflation and tepid wage gains, even as an improving job market had drawn them closer to a rate hike.
U.S. stocks briefly turned positive after release of the minutes before ending almost 1 percent lower as concerns about China's economy continued to weigh. Treasury prices rose and the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
""It was a mixed message, but it still seems inevitable that we will get higher rates,"" said Macrae Sykes, analyst at Gabelli and Co in Rye, New York.
In the 12 months through July, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent. 
It was the second month the annual CPI increased after plunging crude oil prices pushed it into negative terrain in January.
Signs of an ebb in the disinflationary trend, combined with easing labor market slack and a pickup in economic growth are likely to be welcomed by policymakers.
GRADUAL RATE HIKES
Any monetary tightening by the Fed is likely to be gradual given the dampening effect on inflation of a strong dollar, renewed weakness in oil and other commodity prices, and China's devaluation of the yuan, which should push down import prices.
""The low inflation profile will certainly keep the Fed communicating a gradual glide path, but little in the July CPI report suggests that hikes should be delayed,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Goldberg noted that the six-month annualized pace of the CPI accelerated to 2.9 percent from 1.3 percent in June. 
Although the so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose only 0.1 percent last month, that was largely because of the 5.6 percent decline in airline fares. 
Economists expect the drop in air ticket prices, which was the largest since December 1995, will be temporary. Housing costs shot up 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since February 2007. That was on top of a 0.3 percent gain in June. 
With the rental vacancy rate near a 22-year low, housing costs are likely to continue pushing higher, which should support underlying inflation.
""One key issue that is likely to emerge in the debate on inflation is the run-up in shelter costs. Rents are surging and in the face of stagnant wages that leaves less for consumers to spend elsewhere in the economy,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
In the 12 months through July, the core CPI increased 1.8 percent. It was the fourth time in five months that the 12-month change was 1.8 percent.
Apparel prices increased after three straight months of declines. Prices for used cars and trucks and household furnishings and new motor vehicles fell last month.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2015 04:17PM ET</span>","Strong jobs, weak inflation data muddy Fed rate debate: minutes","By Howard Schneider and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials widely agreed last month the economy was nearing the point where interest rates should move higher, but worried lagging inflation and a weak global economy posed too big a risk to commit to ""liftoff.""
Only one Fed policymaker was ready to vote for a rate hike at the central bank's July 28-29 policy meeting, while some others ""viewed the economic conditions for beginning to increase the target range for the federal funds rate as having been met or were confident that they would be met shortly,"" according to minutes from the meeting released on Wednesday.
""Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point,"" the minutes said.
That sentiment, combined with a broader recognition among ""many members"" that full employment was close, led the Fed to say in its post-meeting statement that it only needed to see ""some"" more improvement in labor markets before hiking rates.
But that feeling was offset by apparently widespread concern about weak inflation, tepid wages, and the fact that a six-year recovery had not moved inflation nearer to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target.
""Almost all members ... would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labor market conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term,"" the minutes said.
The Fed has said it wants to be ""reasonably confident"" in the inflation outlook before a rate hike.
Yields on long-term U.S. government bonds fell, U.S. stocks pared losses and the dollar weakened after the release of the minutes, suggesting investors saw them as an indication the Fed would be cautious about hiking rates.
The minutes, however, reflected a now month-old snapshot of Fed opinion, with the data since that meeting having shown steady job growth and an uptick in consumer spending and housing that confirm the central bank's view of a growing economy.
""The overall message of the minutes is: 'we are getting there,'"" wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist for UniCredit Research.
The minutes did not make an overt reference to a possible September rate hike.
SETTING THE TABLE
Several Fed policymakers have said publicly they felt a rate hike will likely be justified next month, though they are monitoring jobs and other data closely.
In the over-the-counter market, three-month overnight indexed swap rates implied traders now see a 35 percent chance of the Fed hiking rates in September, compared to 46 percent late on Tuesday, according to data from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon.
Though the initial hike will have little impact on consumer or business borrowing rates, which have already risen, it will still mark the start of a process that gradually makes it more expensive to buy homes and cars, or fund a vacation on the credit card.
But the discussion at the Fed's July meeting seemed to set the table for that eventuality. It began discussing the mechanics of how to end its current policy of reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds and other assets purchased by the central bank during three rounds of a stimulus program known as quantitative easing.
The Fed has pledged not to reduce its asset holdings until after it begins raising rates.
Policymakers also took steps to clean up their quarterly presentation of economic forecasts, notably by agreeing that once they begin raising rates they will no longer need to publish an existing chart indicating the year in which officials think rates will rise.

That particular graph had become very lopsided: as of June, 15 members said they felt the rates ""liftoff"" would occur this year, with only two expecting it in 2016.
"
317,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2015 02:17PM ET</span>","Conditions for a rate hike have not yet been met, July FOMC mins show","Investing.com -- When the Federal Open Market Committee last met it judged that conditions for an imminent hike in short-term interest rates had not yet been achieved, minutes from its July meeting released on Wednesday afternoon showed.
Following the completion of its July FOMC meeting three weeks ago, the Fed provided no explicit indications that it could raise short-term interest rates when it meets next in September. At the time, the Fed reiterated that it needed to see further improvements in the U.S. labor market and signals that long-term inflation had moved gradually toward its target of 2% before it decided to hike interest rates.
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of July ticked up 0.1%, following solid gains of 0.3% and 0.4% in June and May respectively. The Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, also inched up 0.1% from its June level, below expectations for a 0.2% monthly gain. Over the last 12 months, the core reading has increased 1.8% after remaining unchanged from June.
The muted inflationary gains could appease dovish sentiments at the Fed for a delayed rate hike. Long-term inflation has failed to reach the Fed's annual 2% target for every month over the last three years.
A reading of the July minutes paints a picture of a sharply divided FOMC regarding their views on inflation. The Fed, according to the minutes, said by some objectives the inflation data was ""not progressing"" toward its targeted goal. Other members, however, said that inflation conditions for a rate hike would be met or could be ""met shortly.""
The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since 2009 at the conclusion of the Financial Crisis. In addition, nearly a decade has passed since the Fed has last raised the benchmark rate.
In June, all 17 members of the FOMC expected that the Federal Funds Rate should remain under 1% by the end of 2015, according to the Fed's Dot Plot, which provides a long-term forecast on the path of interest rates. However, the median member projected that the Federal Funds Rate will be between a range of 0.5 and 0.75% at that point -- signaling a rate hike at some point this year and an end to a zero interest rate policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, inched up to 96.53, minutes after the release. Shortly before the announcement, the index fell to an intraday low of 96.46, down more than 0.50% on the session. Yields on U.S. 2-Year government bonds fell roughly four basis points to 0.66% following the release.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose sharply after the release to 17,511.21, down 0.13 points for the session. Minutes before the release, the Dow was at 17,391.35, down approximately 120 points or 0.69% for the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth slowed in July on reduced shipments of cars and electronics to Asia in a sign that the global demand outlook may be losing its luster.
The 7.6 percent annual increase in exports in July was bigger than the median estimate for 5.5 percent annual growth expected by economists in a Reuters poll, but still slower than June's robust 9.5 percent year-on-year rise.
Slowing export growth in July suggests overseas demand in third quarter may not be strong enough to help Japan's gross domestic product recover from a annualized 1.6 percent contraction in April-June as exports slumped and consumers cut back spending, raising questions about the need for more official economic stimulus.
""Exports to Asia look a little sluggish,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""There is still time for exports to recover, but as of now they look a little weak. I don't think we need stimulus measures now, but this could become more likely heading into next year.""
Exports destined for China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 4.2 percent in July from a year ago, compared with June's 5.9 percent annual increase, finance ministry data showed.
Shipments to Asia rose 6.1 percent year-on-year in July, versus a 10.1 percent annual increase in the previous month.
In one bright spot, Japan's exports to the United States rose an annual 18.8 percent in July, more than a 17.6 percent annual increase seen in June, thanks to larger shipments of cars and medicines.
Imports fell 3.2 percent in year-on-year in July versus the median estimate for a 7.9 percent annual decrease as the cost of crude and liquefied natural gas fell.
The trade balance was a deficit of 268 billion yen ($2.2 billion), versus the median estimate for a 56.7 billion yen deficit.
The economy is expected to resume growing in the current quarter if consumer spending bounces back, but weaker exports suggest that the overall pace of expansion may not be enough to generate the price growth needed to banish the risk of returning to deflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July as builders ramped up construction of single-family homes, suggesting that the economy was firing on almost all cylinders.
The Commerce Department report on Tuesday added to solid payrolls, retail sales and industrial output data in suggesting the economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter. The steady flow of upbeat economic reports has bolstered views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September.
""The Fed is likely to take further reassurance that housing is on an improving trend and this should add to the view that the economy is in more normal territory,"" said John Ryding, an economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Groundbreaking increased 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.21 million units, the highest level since October 2007. June and May starts were revised higher, a sign that builders are growing more confident in the economy.
Housing starts have now been above a one million-unit pace for four straight months. Economists had forecast groundbreaking on new homes rising to a 1.19 million-unit pace last month. 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. The S&P homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> jumped 3.09 percent, outperforming the broader market, which was weighed down by weaker-than-expected quarterly results from Wal-Mart (N:WMT).
D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, increased 2.69 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, surged 3.26 percent.
Housing is getting a tailwind from a tightening labor market, which is encouraging young adults to move from their parents' basements and set up their own lodgings. 
Economists expect that housing will absorb some of the slack from a struggling manufacturing sector and contribute to growth this year. The economy expanded at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the second quarter and forecasts for the July-September period are close to a 3.0 percent rate.
Most economists expect the Fed to hike interest rates next month for the first time in almost a decade.
LEADING LIGHT 
""The housing market is a leading light of the economy and it looks like that will be the case for a while. My take is the economy is moving forward solidly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
A report on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders climbed to a near 10-year high in August. The firming housing market is bolstering profits at  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD). The world's No.1 home improvement retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly same-store sales and raised its full-year sales and profit forecast on Tuesday. 
In July, groundbreaking for single-family homes, which accounts for the largest share of the market, surged 12.8 percent to a 782,000 unit pace, the highest level since December 2007. Single-family home building in the South, where most of the home construction takes place, rose to the highest level since January 2008. 
Though housing starts in the Northeast tumbled 27.5 percent, that followed several months of strong gains as builders rushed to take advantage of tax incentives for real estate development in New York that expired in mid-June. 
Groundbreaking on single-family homes in the Northeast in July rose to the highest level since October 2013. Single-family starts in the West increased to a near eight-year high.
""Construction activity is picking up across the country, which we take as a positive signal about the health of the U.S. consumer and overall economy,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York. 
Starts for the volatile multifamily segment fell 17 percent to a 424,000,000 unit rate. The decline, however, is likely to be temporary given a tightening rental vacancy rate. 
While building permits fell 16.3 percent in July to a 1.12 million-unit pace, that followed three straight months of hefty increases and the decline was likely related to the expiration of the tax incentives in New York. Building permits in the Northeast plunged 60.2 percent last month.
Single-family building permits slipped 1.9 percent in July.
Multi-family building permits tumbled 31.8 percent.

International Economic Conditions
Members noted that economic growth in Australia's major trading partners had remained close to its long-run average, although growth had eased a little in the June quarter. The forecast for growth in 2015 and 2016 had been revised down slightly, but growth was expected to remain around its long-run average. The increase in global industrial production had slowed over the past year or so, particularly in the Asian region, and this had contributed to lower commodity prices. Members noted that, as a result, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised down since that presented at the May meeting. Globally, core inflation had been stable in year-ended terms over recent months at rates below the targets of most central banks. Monetary conditions had remained very accommodative.
In China, GDP growth had picked up in the June quarter to be 7 per cent in year-ended terms. However, growth in a range of other indicators of activity had moderated in the first half of 2015. The outlook for Chinese steel demand remained subdued. This had contributed to lower forecasts for iron ore prices, although they were expected to remain above levels seen earlier in the year. Members reviewed evidence that showed conditions in the residential property markets in China had improved further in recent months, but noted that this had not translated into a pick-up in residential property investment outside the largest cities. They observed that downside risks stemming from the weak property market and constraints on local government funding for infrastructure investment had receded somewhat, partly in response to policy measures designed to address these areas. The recent volatility in Chinese equity markets was not expected to have a significant direct effect on consumption, given the relatively limited direct exposure of households to equities.
Economic activity in Japan appeared to have been recovering gradually, but had yet to surpass the levels seen before the increase in the consumption tax in 2014. Nevertheless, the labour market remained relatively tight, wage growth had been higher than a year earlier and the Bank of Japan expected inflation to pick up to the 2 per cent target by around mid 2016. Across the rest of east Asia, output growth looked to have been below average in the June quarter, owing to weakness in both domestic demand and exports. In India, growth in industrial production had strengthened over the past year and a range of indicators pointed to further growth in investment.In the United States, the economy had returned to moderate growth in the June quarter, following temporary weakness earlier in the year. Business investment was around average as a share of nominal GDP and recent indicators were consistent with above-trend growth in consumption in the period ahead. Members observed that lower oil prices should have a net positive effect on output growth in the United States, while recognising that the oil and gas sector had been adversely affected by the lower prices for its output and that households had saved some of the gains from lower fuel prices. Employment growth had strengthened in the June quarter and the unemployment rate had continued to trend lower, while wage growth had been surprisingly low and underlying inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's target.
The gradual recovery in the euro area had continued, supported by very accommodative monetary policy and low oil prices. Output growth appeared to have picked up in the first half of 2015 and unemployment rates in most countries continued to record modest falls. Members noted that there was considerable variation in outcomes across the euro area; sentiment had been rising in a number of countries but had declined in others, most notably Greece. Core inflation had stabilised in year-ended terms, but remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). Developments in Greece appeared to date to have had little effect on economic conditions or confidence in the region as a whole.
Domestic Economic Conditions
The Board's discussion of the domestic economy commenced with the observation that GDP growth over the next couple of years was expected to be slightly lower than forecast in May, although the revision was minor relative to the usual range of uncertainty. A downward revision to population growth had contributed to lower forecast growth in consumption and non-mining business investment. The forecasts for growth in public demand and business investment had been revised lower in light of new data. In contrast, the recent exchange rate depreciation had led to an upward revision to net exports. Aggregate growth was expected to remain moderate for a time before strengthening. Members recognised that the period of significant structural change for the Australian economy associated with the winding down of the mining investment boom would continue for some time.
Members noted that labour market conditions had been a little better than expected over the previous few months, although spare capacity still remained. The unemployment rate had been around 6 per cent in June, after having stabilised over the course of the past year, in contrast to earlier expectations that the unemployment rate would continue to drift higher. This stabilisation was consistent with both stronger-than-expected demand for labour and lower-than-expected population growth. Members discussed the role that low wage growth had played in the pick-up in the employment-to-population ratio over the past year. They noted that the ABS measure of firms' job vacancies was consistent with the unemployment rate remaining around current levels or even declining a little further in the months ahead. Other forward-looking indicators suggested moderate growth in employment in the near term.
The unemployment rate was expected to be a little lower than previously forecast, despite the revised growth profile, partly because the unemployment rate had been lower than expected in the June quarter, and partly because the revision to forecast aggregate demand had been broadly matched by a revision to forecast growth of the economy's productive capacity as a result of lower population growth. However, members noted that there would always be uncertainty about the balance between the growth of aggregate demand and supply.Members noted that the key forces operating on the domestic economy had remained much as they had been for some time. Consumption growth had picked up a little since 2013 and the most recent data on retail sales and liaison information were consistent with the momentum in consumption growth being sustained. In addition, measures of consumer sentiment had remained around average levels. The forecast for consumption growth implied a further gradual decline in the saving ratio in an environment of continued low wage growth. The uncertainties around future consumption and saving decisions of households were discussed.
Housing market conditions had remained strong, supported by low interest rates. House price inflation continued to be strongest in Sydney and Melbourne, while price growth for apartments in these cities had been less rapid, consistent with increased construction of higher-density housing. Outside the two largest cities, housing price growth remained weak and prices had declined in some segments. Forward-looking indicators, such as building approvals and loan approvals for new dwellings, pointed to further strength in dwelling investment in coming quarters.
Housing credit growth had been stable over recent months at around 7 per cent on an annualised basis, while growth in credit to investors in housing had been steady at a bit above 10 per cent. Members noted that growth in credit to investors had been revised up as a result of a reclassification of one bank's loans, but that aggregate growth in housing credit had been unaffected. Members also noted that the Australian  Prudential  (LONDON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) had announced an increase in the amount of regulatory capital the major banks and Macquarie Bank were required to hold for their residential mortgage exposures, to take effect in 2016. A number of banks had also announced increases in the standard variable rate for investor-related housing loans for new and existing borrowers of at least 25 basis points, and there had also been a tightening in lending conditions in this sector.
Non-mining business investment was expected to remain subdued for some time. Although little new information had been received since the previous meeting, survey measures of business conditions, confidence and capacity utilisation had been more positive. Members observed that survey measures of business conditions had been strongest for household and business services, which were also the sectors that had experienced the strongest employment growth over recent years. In contrast, business conditions and employment had been weaker in those sectors of the economy mainly involved in goods production and distribution. Members also noted that, on average, household services used significantly lower amounts of capital per worker than goods-related sectors and were not as well represented in the capital expenditure survey, which by itself implied a weaker forecast profile for non-mining business investment for 2015/16. Members acknowledged that there remained considerable uncertainty around the timing and strength of the recovery in non-mining business investment.
Export volumes appeared to have declined in the June quarter following a strong increase in the previous quarter. The weakness in resource exports partly reflected some temporary factors affecting coal and liquefied natural gas production, but a moderation in demand from China may have contributed to lower iron ore exports. Net service exports had made a strong contribution to output growth over the past year, supported by the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate.
Inflation in the June quarter had been broadly as expected and domestic inflationary pressures had remained well contained. The consumer price index had increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter (in seasonally adjusted terms) and by 1.5 per cent over the year. The quarterly outcome reflected a rebound in the price of fuel, although it was still around 10 per cent lower than a year earlier. The various measures suggested that underlying inflation was around ½ per cent in the June quarter and 2¼ per cent over the year.Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market and the low growth of labour costs were reflected in low inflation for market services, while inflation in the cost of new dwellings had remained strong, particularly in Sydney. Domestic cost pressures were expected to remain contained over the forecast period. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had declined modestly in the June quarter and over the preceding year. However, members observed that the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar would place further upward pressure on the final prices of tradable items over the next few years, which had led to a slight upward revision to the inflation forecast. Underlying inflation was expected to be around 2½ per cent over the forecast period, consistent with the inflation target.
Financial Markets
The Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with a focus on the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy. While policy was unchanged at the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, recent commentary from Fed officials continued to suggest that policy tightening could start at the September meeting, whereas financial markets had only fully priced in a rate increase by December. Members noted that when the Fed actually delivered its first interest rate increase in nine years, there was likely to be a sizeable market impact notwithstanding how well telegraphed the change in policy had been. It was likely that financial market volatility would increase and the US dollar could appreciate further, including against the Australian dollar and a number of other currencies in Asia.
The US dollar had appreciated over the past month, particularly against the currencies of commodity exporters, including those of Australia as well as Canada and New Zealand, where the central banks had eased policy in July. The Australian dollar had depreciated by 5 per cent against the US dollar and by 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, taking the exchange rate to around its lowest level since 2009 on both measures. The New Zealand dollar had also depreciated sharply against the US dollar to a level that was around 15 per cent lower than in late April.
In sharp contrast, the Chinese renmimbi had continued to be little changed against the US dollar. Chinese international reserves had declined by around 7 per cent in recent quarters to help achieve stability against the US dollar in the face of an outflow of capital. Chinese equity markets remained volatile, despite measures introduced by the Chinese Government in early July that had steadied the Chinese equity market for a time. Large falls in Chinese equity prices had occurred again more recently, resulting in cumulative falls from recent peaks being back around 30 per cent, although equity prices remained 70 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Equity prices in the advanced economies had generally been little changed over the past month. This included the euro area, where equity prices had been more volatile but had recovered their earlier falls when Greece had moved closer to an agreement with its creditors. Australian equity prices had risen since the end of June.Turning to developments in Greece, members noted that the Greek Government and its official sector creditors had reached an agreement to start negotiations on a new three-year bailout program. Much of the program would be used to refinance existing obligations as they fell due, as well as to recapitalise the Greek banks. The Eurogroup had arranged a €7 billion bridging loan to enable Greece to meet its short-term commitments, including clearing its arrears at the International Monetary Fund and repaying a maturing bond held by the ECB. Greek banks had reopened on 20 July following the ECB's decision to increase its emergency lending assistance, but capital controls remained in place.
Government bond yields in the major economies had mostly fallen over the past month, mainly fluctuating alongside market concerns about Greece. Bond yields in Australia had largely tracked those in the United States over the past month. With state issuance of bonds projected at modest levels, spreads and yields on state government debt remained low.Australian financial market pricing indicated no likelihood of an easing of monetary policy at the present meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Global economic conditions were expected to continue to be supported by the lower level of oil prices and accommodative global financial conditions. Global industrial production growth had eased further this year, particularly in the Asian region, and this had contributed to lower commodity prices. Growth of Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around its long-run average over the next two years. Members observed that the downside risks to the outlook for Chinese growth identified over the past year had receded somewhat, although the
Government's policy response to the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets had clouded the medium-term economic outlook. Uncertainties arising from the expected start of monetary policy tightening in the United States had moved into sharper focus.
Domestically, economic activity had generally been more positive over recent months. Very low interest rates were continuing to support strong growth in dwelling investment and consumption, and the further depreciation of the Australian dollar was expected to impart stimulus to the economy through stronger net exports. Although surveys of business investment intentions and non-residential building approvals suggested that non-mining business investment would remain subdued for some time, members noted that non-mining business profits had increased, business conditions were clearly above average and businesses had been hiring more labour, partly encouraged by very low wage growth. As a result, employment had risen as a share of the working age population and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable, in contrast to earlier expectations of a further increase. The recent data on inflation were largely as expected.
Members noted that output growth was expected to pick up gradually from its below-average pace over the past year to exceed 3 per cent in 2017. The forecast for the unemployment rate had been revised lower since the previous forecasts had been presented. The further depreciation of the Australian dollar had resulted in a slight upward revision to the forecast for inflation. Nonetheless, inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period given that domestic cost pressures were likely to remain well contained.
Credit was growing moderately overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. House prices continued to rise strongly in Sydney and Melbourne, but trends had been more varied in a number of other cities. Members observed that recent responses by banks to the suite of measures implemented by APRA in respect of lending to investors in housing, including a tightening in lending conditions, would be expected to reduce the risks relating to the housing market, although it was too early to gauge their full effects.
Members noted that an accommodative monetary policy setting remained appropriate given the forecasts, while observing that the Australian economy had been adjusting to the shift in activity in the resources sector from the investment to the production phase. This shift had been accompanied by significant declines in key commodity prices and was being assisted by the depreciation of the exchange rate over recent months.
In light of these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged. New information about economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and determine whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with target.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial output advanced at its strongest pace in eight months in July as auto production surged, another bullish sign for third-quarter economic growth that boosts the prospects of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month.
While other data on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment early this month, households were upbeat about their personal finances, a good omen for consumer spending. July employment and retail sales data also struck an optimistic note on the economy. 
""It adds to the steady drum-beat of solid indicators that suggest the economy is getting off to a much better start in the second half of the year and further increases the odds toward a September rate hike by the Fed,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Industrial production shot up 0.6 percent last month after a downwardly revised increase of 0.1 percent in June, the Fed said. Economists polled by Reuters had looked for a rise of 0.3 percent in July.
The gain in output reflected a 0.8 percent increase in factory production that was spurred by a 10.6 percent surge in motor vehicle output, the largest increase since September 2009.
Auto manufacturers typically shut down production lines in summer for retooling, but economists speculated they probably had done so for only a short period, leading to the jump in vehicle production. Apart from autos, manufacturing rose 0.1 percent last month. 
Mining production edged up 0.2 percent as oil and gas well drilling output grew for the first time in 10 months, suggesting the energy sector was starting to stabilize after being undermined by last year's plunge in crude oil prices.
Despite the surge in July, industrial production remains constrained by a strong dollar and lower oil prices.
""We continue to see a stronger dollar and lower energy prices as posing headwinds for industrial output and do not look for a strong rebound in the sector this year,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt fell.
BENIGN INFLATION OUTLOOK
In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index slipped to 92.9 in early August from a reading of 93.1 in July. Still, it was the highest nine-month average since 2004 and consistent with a 3 percent annualized rate of increase in consumer spending. 
The Labor Department also reported on Friday that its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month as the cost of services rose. The PPI gained 0.4 percent in June. 
In the 12 months through July, the PPI fell 0.8 percent after declining 0.7 percent in June. It was the sixth straight 12-month decrease in the index. 
But inflation pressures are likely to remain benign due to the strong dollar, falling oil prices and China's recent devaluation of its currency. Inflation has been persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target. 
""Looking ahead there appears to be further downward price pressure in the pipeline as a result of slowing global demand, and of course the recent devaluation of the yuan is likely to only exacerbate that pressure on commodity prices,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago.
The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, rose 0.4 percent in July after increasing 0.2 percent in the prior month.

A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in June. The so-called core PPI was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through July.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany enjoyed robust if unspectacular growth in the second quarter while the French economy stagnated, leaving policymakers looking at a fragile euro zone recovery and risks from volatile Chinese markets.
The German economy, Europe's largest, grew by 0.4 percent on the quarter -- a slight acceleration from 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year but below expectations for a 0.5 percent expansion as weak investment acted as a drag.
In France, a jump in exports was not strong enough to offset the impact of weak consumer spending and changes in inventories and growth came to a standstill after a strong first quarter.
Data for the whole of the euro zone is expected at 0900 GMT.
The readouts from the euro zone's two largest economies came a day after the minutes of the European Central Bank's last meeting showed it was concerned that volatility in Chinese markets may have more impact than expected on the euro zone.
China has seen a run of weak economic data.
The ECB described the recovery in the 19-country euro zone as moderate and gradual, a trend it called ""disappointing"", and said an increase in U.S. interest rates might slow the upturn.
Private sector economists are also concerned that Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, is not growing faster despite favorable conditions.
""The fact that record low interest rates, low energy prices and the weak euro have not led to a stronger expansion in our view shows that the German economy has simply reached the end of its long positive virtuous circle of structural reforms and growth,"" said Carsten Brzeski at ING.
""Normally, such a cocktail of strong external steroids should have given wings to the economy. This is not the case.""
Germany's Federal Statistics Office said weakness in investment and a marked drop in inventories weighed on growth in the second quarter, while the weaker euro helped support exports.
The euro fell sharply at the start of the year, shedding more than 8 percent on a trade-weighted basis between January and March - its weakest quarter ever <EUREER=ECBF>. The single currency did gain back some ground in the second quarter, rising just over 2 percent, but since the start of the year it is down almost 6 percent.
In France, companies that were selling down their inventories after building them up in the first quarter accounted for much of the stagnation, dragging GDP growth down by 0.4 percentage points.
That annulled the 0.3 point increase to GDP from foreign trade and meager 0.1 percent from domestic demand.
Economic reports from other northern euro zone economies gave little reason for optimism even though they have been spared the worst of the currency bloc's debt crisis.
In the Netherlands, the economy grew by 0.1 percent on the quarter in the April-June period.

In Finland, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in April-June for the fourth consecutive quarter as the Nordic euro zone member struggles to revive exports to its major markets, Europe and Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded in July as households boosted purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, suggesting the economy was growing solidly early in the third quarter and bolstering the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike.
While other data on Thursday showed a rise in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, the trend still firmly pointed to a tightening labor market.
""U.S. consumers are out there spending and driving a large part of economic growth. It means the Fed will be confident that the economy is still on fairly strong footing and supports the view that they could raise rates in September,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6 percent last month, broadly in line with economists' expectations, and were unchanged in June, an upward revision from the previously reported 0.3 percent drop. May's data was also revised higher, adding to the report's upbeat tone.
Sales last month rose in most categories, with receipts at auto dealerships increasing 1.4 percent after falling 1.5 percent in June.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.3 percent after a revised 0.2 percent gain in June. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent in June. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. 
The retail sales data added to fairly strong July employment and small business confidence reports in suggesting steady economic momentum at the start of the third quarter. GDP grew at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the April-June period. 
Q2 GROWTH MUCH STRONGER
It also added to June data on factory inventories and imports as well as upward revisions to May construction spending figures in suggesting that growth in the second quarter was probably much stronger than the government reported last month. 
Prior to Thursday's data, economists were expecting the advance second-quarter GDP growth figure could be raised to at least a 3.0 percent pace. 
In the wake of the retail sales data and another report from the Commerce Department showing a 0.8 percent jump in business inventories in June, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it now expected GDP would be revised up four-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.5 percent rate. High inventories could, however, undercut growth in the third quarter.
The government will publish its second GDP growth estimate later this month. Given the steadily firming economy, many economists expect the Fed will raise its short-term lending rate in September for the first time in nearly a decade.
But weak inflation pressures and China's devaluation of its currency this week could make the U.S. central bank cautious about tightening monetary policy. Economists at  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) estimate that a 10 percent drop in the yuan against the dollar could shave about one-tenth of a percentage point off inflation over 12 months.
A third report from the Labor Department showed import prices fell 0.9 percent in July.
""The Fed will see this (yuan devaluation) as a transitory factor,"" said Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""But we are well aware that the inflation target set by the central bank has been missed for more than three years, which is the reason why some voting members would be comfortable to further delay hiking rates.""
The Labor Department also reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000 for the week ended Aug. 8.
Though claims have risen for three straight weeks, they have for 23 consecutive weeks remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a firming jobs markets.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since April 2000. The tightening labor market is steadily lifting household income, which is supporting consumer spending.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy unexpectedly returned to growth in the second quarter despite political turmoil and the threat of a Greek euro zone exit, data showed on Thursday.
In a boost for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's leftist government, revised data also showed that Greece posted no growth or decline in economic output in the first quarter instead of a previously reported 0.2 percent contraction.
That meant the country did not enter into a recession at the start of the year as previously believed - a slide that was expected to have been exacerbated by Tsipras' hard line against the austerity imposed by international lenders.
Gross domestic product expanded 0.8 percent from April to June, based on seasonally adjusted flash estimates from statistics service ELSTAT. This was far above a forecast by analysts polled by Reuters of a 0.8 percent contraction quarter-on-quarter.
No official data was provided on what drove the growth as these are preliminary figures. But analysts said some sectors, such as the tourism mainstay of the economy, had shown ability to withstand the uncertainty stemming from months of deadlocked talks with foreign lenders.
""Some economic activity indicators in the second quarter, including consumption, industrial production and tourism, had shown particular resilience,"" said economist Nikos Magginas at National Bank. ""This explains the surprising second quarter GDP reading.""
He said the data helped shape a more favorable outlook for the year as a whole, rendering the prospect of an overall contraction of less than 2 percent for 2015 ""realistic"".
Under the baseline scenario Greek authorities have agreed with international creditors in the new bailout agreement, Greece's economy is projected to shrink by 2.1 to 2.3 percent this year.
Greece's economy emerged from a six-year recession in 2014 but shrank in the final quarter as political upheaval returned.
More recently, and not captured in Thursday's data, economic activity was sharply hit by the imposition of capital controls and a three-week shutdown of banks starting June 29.
The Greek parliament on Thursday was preparing to approve a new 85 billion euro bailout deal with the European Union that Greece needs to avoid defaulting on a debt repayment next week."

At least two members of the board suggested that inflation expectations have either weakened or are lower, something BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters after the July meeting that ""some board members"" were more cautious about their inflation outlook.
The BoJ held policy steady at its latest meeting last week with the outlook largely stable with previous forecasts for economic recovery.
Still, the majority of the board still believe Japan can achieve the 2% inflation target by around the six-month period ending September next year, overcoming current zero inflation, the minutes said.
At its July meeting, the BoJ board decided by an 8 to 1 vote to leave the bank's policy target unchanged (one member continued to propose a less stimulative policy target) while revising down their inflation projections slightly for the next few years amid slowing global growth.
Data released before the July meeting showed that Japan's core consumer price index - excluding volatile perishables - rose 0.1% on year in May, slowing from a 0.3% gain in April.
The latest data released later showed that the pace of year-on-year increase in core CPI remained at a gain of 0.1% in June.

The higher than expected surge in U.S. gasoline demand – a closely watched figure that represents 10 percent of the global market – has also helped provide a floor to crashing oil prices. 
U.S. motorists are paying an average of $2.58 per gallon, nearly a dollar less than a year ago, according to AAA, the nation's largest motorist advocacy group. And a quarter of respondents expected prices to continue to decline, up from 10 percent a month ago. 
The survey found that nearly 80 percent of people say gas prices influence how they feel about the economy. And with gas prices down nearly $1 from a year ago, U.S. motorists are feeling positive about the direction of the economy, the survey found.
""There is good news for retailers as consumer optimism picks up during peak vacation season,"" said NACS Vice President of Strategic Industry Initiatives Jeff Lenard.
The survey found that 34 percent of people expect to drive more during August, compared to 8 percent who said they will drive less.
The national average gasoline price per gallon dipped below $2 in January, but most people don't think the country will see those prices again any time soon. Respondents said if pump prices fall below $2, they would drive even more frequently and have additional discretionary income.

""The sub $2 would be interesting,"" Lenard said. ""In previous times, we had big declines that were for terrible events: 2008 economic collapse and 9/11. Those were demand driven. This is supply driven.""

404,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2015 10:32AM ET</span>","U.S. productivity rises in Q2, but trend still soft","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. non farm productivity rebounded in the second quarter, but a weak underlying trend suggested inflation could pick up more quickly than economists have anticipated.
Productivity increased at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the April-June period, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. But productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose only 0.3 percent from a year ago.
In line with annual revisions to gross domestic product published last week, first quarter productivity was revised to show it falling at a 1.1 percent rate instead of the previously reported 3.1 percent pace of decline. 
""What it means is that inflation could be more problematic down the road, but we haven't seen it yet. It's something to think about long term,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Productivity is one of the metrics the Federal Reserve is watching as it contemplates raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Economists had forecast productivity rising at a 1.6 percent rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the period.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors focused on China's devaluation of its currency. U.S. Treasuries prices were trading higher, while U.S. stocks and the dollar fell. 
Annual revisions showed productivity was unchanged in 2013, the weakest annual reading since 1982. Productivity in 2013 was previously reported to have increased at a 1.2 percent rate.
The average annual rate of productivity growth from 2007 to 2014 was revised down to 1.3 percent per year from 1.4 percent, well below the long-term rate of 2.2 percent per year from 1947 to 2014.
OUTPUT GAP SHRINKING FASTER?
Growth in productivity is an important determinant of the economy's non-inflationary speed limit. The downward revisions suggested the economy's growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent pace that economists have been estimating.
That would imply the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflation pressures may take hold a bit faster than had been anticipated.
""We are growing much faster versus potential than we had previously thought. So the output gap over the more recent time frame looks like it is closing at a faster rate than we had thought prior to GDP benchmark revisions,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
""The faster you close the output gap, the faster you get to that threshold where you start to see inflationary pressures.""
But inflation remains benign for now. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at only a 0.5 percent rate in the second quarter after advancing at a downwardly revised 2.3 percent pace in the first quarter. 
They were previously reported to have increased at a 6.7 percent rate in the January-March period. Unit labor costs rose 2.1 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Compensation per hour increased at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter after rising at a downwardly revised 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter. 
Compensation was previously reported to have increased at a 3.3 percent rate in the first quarter. It was up 2.4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories increased 0.9 percent in June, higher than the 0.7 percent rise the government had forecast in the advance second-quarter GDP estimate. 

June data on factory inventories and imports published last week suggested the GDP growth estimate could be revised to as high as a 3 percent rate.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2015 07:01AM ET</span>",U.S. small business confidence bounces back in July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small business confidence rebounded in July from a 15-month low as owners anticipated solid sales and inventory growth, providing another boost to the economic outlook for the third quarter.
The National Federation of Independent Business said on
Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index increased 1.3 points to 95.4. About 1,495 businesses took part in the survey. Last month's increase partially recouped June's plunge, which had pushed the index to its lowest level since March 2014.
Data on automobile sales, employment and the services sector have suggested a steady build-up of economic momentum at the start of the third quarter after gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Seven of the index's 10 components increased last month, while three continued to decline. 
Owners were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months, and their expectations about sales improved after weakening for several months. They were optimistic about investing in capital and inventories. 
There was an increase in the number of small business owners who said that now was a good time to expand. 
The survey's labor market gauges improved after weakening a bit in June. Fifty-seven percent reported hiring or trying to recruit workers in July, up five percentage points from June.
Twenty-five percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill, up one point from June, but four points below the highest reading for 2015. About 23 percent of owners reported raising worker compensation, up two points from June.
The survey pointed to tame inflation pressures in the near term. Thirteen percent of small business owners reported reducing their average selling prices in the past three months, down one point from June. 

About 17 percent reported price increases, also down a point from the prior month. Seventeen percent said they planned to raise average prices in the next few months, down two points from June.

The New York Fed's survey of consumer expectations, released on Monday, found median one- and three-year ahead inflation expectations remained stable at 3 percent. 
But over the coming year, household spending growth expectations plunged to 3.5 percent in July, from 4.3 percent the previous month, hitting the lowest since the survey began in mid-2013 thanks in part to respondents over 40-years old and those with lower levels of education.
Home price inflation expectations logged the survey's second-lowest level at 3.2 percent, from 3.5 percent, while year-ahead gas price inflation predictions slumped to 4.4 percent, from 5.4 percent. 
The survey taps about 1,200 respondents on a 12-month rotating basis.

The producer price index (PPI) fell 5.4 percent from a year earlier, the National Statistics Bureau said on Sunday, compared with an expected 5.0 percent decline. It was the worst reading since October 2009 and the 40th straight month of price falls.
The index, which tracks the factory-gate selling prices of firms from miners to manufacturers, pointed to persistent weakness in commodity prices and soft demand in China's economy which are eroding company profits.
An official factory survey last week showed deteriorating conditions forced companies to cut staffing for the 21st straight month, and manufacturers had to reduce selling prices to a six-month low due to increasing competition.
In line with sluggishness in the broader economy, annual consumer inflation stayed muted at 1.6 percent despite surging pork prices, slightly higher than a 1.5 percent estimate, and up from June's 1.4 percent.
The data showed pork price inflation was the most buoyant in July, with prices surging 16.7 percent due to a sharp fall in hog supplies.
Pork prices are an important component of China's consumer price index basket, the weighting of which is a secret though some economists estimate that food accounts for as much as 30 percent of the index.
But economists do not believe higher pork prices alone will derail further policy easing in coming months, as Beijing fights to meet its 7 percent 2015 growth target.
HSBC said in a recent research note that it still expects another 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut in the second-half of this year and a 200 bps cut in banks' required reserve ratio (RRR).
The central bank has already cut interest rates four times since November and lowered the RRR for big banks by 150 bps.
A private survey last week showed factory activity in China shrank the most in two years in July , and a raft of data this week is expected to indicate renewed weakness in China's economy. Despite the easy money environment, industrial profits dropped in June on falling prices, while banks saw a surge in bad loans for the first-half.

Compounding the grim picture, panic selling in Chinese shares (SSEC) earlier in the month have rattled business and consumer confidence, though unprecedented government support measures have stemmed the rout for now.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese exports tumbled 8.3 percent in July, their biggest drop in four months and far worse than expected, reinforcing expectations that Beijing will be forced to roll out more stimulus to support the world's second-largest economy.
Imports also fell heavily from a year earlier, in line with market forecasts but suggesting domestic demand might be too feeble to offset the weaker global demand for China's exports.
Economists had forecast exports to fall just 1 percent, after a 2.8 percent uptick in June, but the data on Saturday showed depressed demand from Europe and the first drop in exports to the United States, China's biggest market, since March.
Exports to the European Union fell 12.3 percent in July while those to the United States dropped 1.3 percent. Demand from Japan, another big trading partner, slid 13 percent.
""A recovery in external demand remains far off and economic growth will continue to rely on domestic demand, which implies policies should continue to be relaxed in the second half,"" wrote Qu Hongbin, China economist at global bank HSBC.
Imports fell 8.1 percent, according to the data from the General Administration of Customs. That compared with forecasts for an 8 percent drop, after a 6.1 percent decline in June, though these falls also reflected weaker commodity prices.
China recorded a trade surplus of $43.03 billion for the month, below forecasts of $53.25 billion.
The July trade data could further dim hopes for an economic turnaround in the second half of this year, after a few signs of stabilization had emerged in June.
China's factory activity suffered its biggest contraction in two years in July as new orders fell.
On Friday the central bank published a report warning of further economic weakness, but argued the economy needed a retooled growth engine, instead of short-term stimulus.
Economists also blame a strong yuan for the export weakness, with ANZ Research estimating the currency's nominal effective exchange rate has risen by 13.5 percent since June 2014.
Analysts say Beijing has been keeping its yuan strong to wean its economy off low-end export manufacturing. A strong yuan policy also supports domestic buying power, helps Chinese firms to borrow and invest abroad, and encourages foreign firms and governments to increase their use of the currency.
""These factors suggest that China's exports will continue to face strong headwinds,"" Liu Ligang and Louis Lam said in an ANZ Research note on Saturday, adding that they doubted Beijing would hit its trade growth target of 6 percent for this year.
China's weak import figure partly reflects weak commodity prices paid to trading partners such as Australia, which ships coal and iron ore to China. Volume imports of most major commodities were higher than expected, as Chinese industry took advantage of the lower prices to restock on raw materials.
Coal deliveries in particular rose strongly in July, up 28.1 percent, though commodity analysts said that prospects for the market remained dim overall.
Stephen Koukoulas, managing director of Australian consultancy Markets Economics, said the fall in commodity prices was a major concern for the Australian and New Zealand economies, which both rely heavily on demand from China.

""Probably the volumes are ok but the prices that are being paid are hugely lower. We have got a real concern there for the future levels of the Aussie dollar,"" Koukoulas said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment rose at a solid clip in July and wages rebounded after a surprise stall in the prior month, signs of an improving economy that opened the door wider to a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in September.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 215,000 last month as a pickup in construction and manufacturing jobs offset further declines in the mining sector, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate held at a seven-year low of 5.3 percent.
Payrolls data for May and June were revised to show 14,000 more jobs created than previously reported. In addition, the average workweek increased to 34.6 hours, the most since February, from 34.5 hours in June.
""We view this report as easily clearing the hurdle needed to keep the Fed on track for a September rate hike. The bar for not moving now is much higher,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
The Fed last month upgraded its assessment of the labor market, describing it as continuing to ""improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment.""
The U.S. central bank said its policy-setting committee anticipated it would be appropriate to raise lending rates when it has seen ""some further improvement"" in the jobs market. It has not raised rates since 2006.
U.S. stocks fell after the jobs data as traders saw a greater chance of a rate hike next month. The dollar rose to near a four-month high against a basket of currencies before weakening. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were up.
Though hiring has slowed from last year's robust pace - mostly because of job losses in the energy sector - it remains at double the rate needed to keep up with population growth.
Average hourly earnings increased five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month after being flat in June. That put them 2.1 percent above the year-ago level, but well shy of the 3.5 percent growth rate economists associate with full employment.
Still, the gain supported views that a sharp slowdown in compensation growth in the second quarter and consumer spending in June were temporary. The aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, rose 0.6 percent in July and was up 4.9 percent from a year ago.
Economists had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing 223,000 last month and wages rising 0.2 percent.
WAGE VIGIL
Wage growth has been disappointingly slow. But tightening labor market conditions and decisions by several state and local governments to raise their minimum wage have fueled expectations of a pickup.
In addition, a number of retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the nation's largest private employer, Target and TJX Cos have increased pay for hourly workers.
The jobless rate is near the 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent range most Fed officials think is consistent with a steady but low level of inflation.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell one-tenth of a percentage point to a seven-year low of 10.4 percent in July.
The short-term unemployment rate slipped to 3.8 percent from 3.9 percent in June, while the jobless rate for the long-term unemployed held steady at 1.4 percent.
But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at a more than 37-1/2-year low of 62.6 percent.
The fairly healthy employment report added to robust July automobile sales and service industries data in suggesting the economy continues to gather momentum after growing at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Last month's increase in the workweek together with the solid payrolls gain lifted the index of total hours worked by 0.5 percent, the largest rise since October. The hours worked index is seen as a proxy for gross domestic product.
""We think this represents another solid employment report that meets the criteria for 'some further improvement' in the labor market and keeps the Fed in play for September,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut. 
Employment gains in July were broad-based, with the share of industries adding jobs hitting a seven-month high. Construction payrolls rose 6,000 thanks to a strengthening housing market, after being unchanged in June.
Factory payrolls increased 15,000 after rising 2,000 in June. The retail sector added 35,900 jobs.
Professional and business services payrolls gained 40,000 after increasing 69,000 in June. The slowdown reflected a drop of 8,900 in temporary employment, which was the weakest reading since September 2012.
More layoffs in the energy sector, which is grappling with last year's sharp decline in crude oil prices, were a drag on mining payrolls, which shed 4,000 jobs in July. The mining sector has lost 78,000 jobs since December.

Oilfield giants Schlumberger and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced thousands of job cuts in the past few months.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending August 1 rose by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 270,000 from the previous week’s total of 267,000. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to rise by 6,000 to 273,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 22 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 25 fell to 2.255 million from 2.269 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.240 million.
The four-week moving average was 268,250, a decrease of 6,500 from the previous week’s total of 274,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private job growth slowed in July, but a surge in services industry activity to a near-decade high suggested solid economic momentum that strengthens the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
The firm domestic fundamentals were underscored by another report on Wednesday showing an increase in imports of food, automobiles, industrial supplies and consumer goods in June.
""This will be interpreted as very good news for the Fed and will be seen as further confirmation of progress towards meeting its growth targets. At this point, we continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at the September meeting,"" said Cheng Chen, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index jumped to 60.3 last month, the highest reading since August 2005, from 56 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than a third of the U.S. economy.
The index was buoyed by a 5.5 point increase in the new orders gauge, which also hit its highest level since August 2005. A measure of service industry employment soared 6.9 points to its highest reading in a decade. Fifteen services industries reported expansion last month, while mining and one other saw a contraction in production.
The ISM survey, however, likely overstates the services sector expansion. Another survey from data firm Markit showed the sector growing moderately in July. 
Still, the services sector is helping to offset the drag on the economy from weak manufacturing. 
The jump in service sector employment in July also eased concerns on Wednesday of a sharp slowdown in job growth after the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired only 185,000 workers last month. Economists had expected a gain of 215,000. 
The report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the U.S. government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday. It is, however, not considered a good predictor of nonfarm payrolls.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while U.S. stocks edged higher. The dollar was slightly firmer against a basket of currencies. 
'APPROACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT'
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 223,000 last month, matching June's job gains. Job cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of the sharp drop in crude oil prices have take some edge off the labor market in recent months.
""Nonetheless, even at this slower pace of growth, the labor market is fast approaching full employment,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. A report last week showing wage growth stalled in the second quarter cast doubt that the U.S. central bank would hike rates at its September policy meeting.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit increased 7.1 percent to $43.8 billion in June.
But May's trade gap was revised down by $1 billion to $40.9 billion, leading economists to expect that the second-quarter gross domestic product estimate would be revised up from the 2.3 percent annual pace the government reported last week.
May construction and factory inventory data released this week also have suggested second-quarter growth could be revised to at least a 3 percent annual rate when the government publishes its second GDP estimate later this month.
June's trade deficit was driven by a 1.2 percent rise in imports, as domestic demand grew solidly in the second quarter. The dollar, which has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, is also making imports cheaper. 
Despite firming domestic demand, some of the imports likely ended up in inventories, which remained at very high levels in the second quarter. That would act as drag on third-quarter growth.
Imports of food and automobiles were the highest on record in June. Dollar strength and sluggish global demand crimped exports, which slipped 0.1 percent in June. It was the second straight monthly drop in exports. 
Imports from the European Union surged 4.0 percent to a record high, leaving the trade deficit with the EU at an all-time high.
Though exports to Mexico rose solidly, they were outpaced by a jump in imports, putting the trade deficit with that country at the highest level since May 2012. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 3.3 percent to $31.5 billion.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) compiled by Caixin/Markit rose to 53.8 from June's 51.8. The July level is the highest since August 2014 and marks a 12th straight month of expansion.
A reading above 50 points indicates growth on a monthly basis, while one below that points to a contraction.
A sub-index measuring new business jumped to 54.0 from June's 52.2 while the employment sub-index also edged up, indicating increased hiring on stronger new businesses.
Both input prices and selling prices increased in July, indicating a slight pick-up in inflationary pressure.
The Caixin PMI report did not specify if there was an impact on the services sector from the crash in the country's stock markets from mid-June. A sharp rally early in the year had boosted performance for banks and brokerages, and gave a much needed lift to the cooling economy.
The official services PMI released on Saturday showed that activity quickened slightly in July from the previous month.
The relatively resilient services sector could help offset some downward pressure on the economy as the manufacturing sector struggles to cope with weaker demand at home and abroad.
The final Caixin/Markit factory survey showed activity contracted the most in two years in July while the official PMI showed manufacturing growth unexpectedly stalled.
The official surveys focus on large, state-owned firms, while the private ones measure activity across small to medium-sized firms, which are facing tougher financial and operating conditions.
The services sector has accounted for the bigger part of China's economic output for at least two years, with its share rising to 48.2 percent last year, compared with the 42.6 percent contribution from manufacturing and construction.

The government has taken a series of steps since last year to try to put a floor beneath sputtering economic growth, including accelerating infrastructure spending and repeated reductions in interest rates and banks' reserve ratio. But growth is still expected to moderate this year to around 7 percent, the slowest in a quarter of a century.

Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy.
Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR), the global home appliances giant.
Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar's strength will likely remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies.
Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. 
There were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components.
SOLID INVENTORIES
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – increased 0.7 percent instead of the 0.9 percent rise reported last month. 
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent.
Manufacturing inventories increased a solid 0.6 percent, which was more than the government assumed in its second-quarter GDP snapshot published last week. 
Coming on the heels of a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, economists said the sturdy increase in factory inventories suggested that second-quarter GDP could be revised to as high as a 3 percent annual pace.
The Commerce Department reported last Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter. It will publish its second GDP estimate for that quarter later this month.
In the wake of the construction data, economists had said they expected second-quarter growth would be raised by at least four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace. They forecast factory inventories adding another 0.3 percentage point.
But with the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, compared to 1.30 last September, manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters.

""It also highlights the probability that an unwinding of this stockpiling will almost assuredly result in a drag on GDP growth in the second half of the year,"" Tim Quinlin, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

For the full-text statement of the decision, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but some key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago. Much of this trend appears to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Hence, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. Despite fluctuations in markets associated with the respective developments in China and Greece, long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low.
In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy has continued to grow.
While the rate of growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages, it has been associated with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. Recent information confirms that domestic inflationary pressures have been contained. That should remain the case for some time, given the very slow growth in labour costs. Inflation is thus forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates.
The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slipped in July and consumer spending advanced at its slowest pace in four months in June, indicating that the economy had lost some momentum recently.
But that could be short-lived as major automakers on Monday reported stronger-than-expected U.S. sales last month, which came after a dip in June and kept the industry on track for its best year in a decade. 
The sluggish economic data did not change economists' expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year, given a tightening labor market.
""We expect growth momentum to re-accelerate over the next few months, providing the Fed with the necessary confidence they need to raise rates in September,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management said its national factory activity index fell to 52.7 last month from a reading of 53.5 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. 
A gauge of new orders received by factories rose to a seven-month high, while inventories continued to decline.
There was growth in 11 of the 18 manufacturing industries, including furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and transportation equipment. Five industries including machinery reported that production had contracted in July.
Manufacturing has been hobbled by a strong dollar, which has pressured the profits of multinational corporations, and deep spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's plunge in crude oil prices. 
Weak global demand also has been a drag on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
""The negatives of the strong dollar, slower-than-expected foreign growth and lower oil prices appear to still be exerting a negative influence through an inventory adjustment,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
U.S. stocks were trading lower, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar firmed slightly against a basket of currencies. 
CONSUMERS STEP BACK
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending - which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity - rose 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent increase in May. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged after rising 0.4 percent in May.
The data was included in last week's second-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending expanding at a 2.9 percent annual rate and the overall economy growing at a 2.3 percent pace.
The Fed last week described the economy as expanding ""moderately,"" upgraded its view of the labor market and said housing had shown ""additional"" improvement. Its assessment left the door open for a possible rate hike in September, which would be the first increase in nearly a decade.
Consumer spending in June was restrained by a decline in auto purchases. But with auto sales accelerating in July, spending likely gathered steam last month, and is expected to be supported by rising incomes as the jobs market approaches full employment and firming home prices boost household wealth.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported a 5 percent jump in sales for July, well above the 2 percent gain expected by analysts, on the strength of demand for its F-Series pickup trucks. Strong demand for trucks lifted sales at General Motors (N:GM) by 6 percent.
Analysts expect auto sales to total about 17.1 million vehicles this year, which would be the highest level in more than a decade.
Personal income rose 0.4 percent in June, increasing by the same margin for a third straight month. The saving rate jumped to 4.8 percent from 4.6 percent in May. 
Inflation remained well below the Fed's 2 percent target. A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3 percent.
Excluding food and energy, prices edged up 0.1 percent for the third straight month. It was up 0.148 percent before rounding. The so-called core PCE price index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through June. 
""There is a hint of an upward trend here that might help reassure policymakers that headline inflation will head toward the Fed's target rate once oil prices stabilize,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2015 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending gain smallest in five months,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending barely rose in June as private outlays posted their biggest drop in a year, but the underlying trend suggested the economy remained on solid ground.
Construction spending increased 0.1 percent, the smallest rise since January, the Commerce Department said on Monday. 
May's outlays were revised sharply higher to show a 1.8 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent rise. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6 percent in June. Construction spending was up 12 percent compared to June of last year.
In June, construction spending was restrained by a 0.5 percent drop in private construction spending, the largest decrease since June 2014. Spending on private non-residential construction projects fell 1.3 percent, the biggest drop since January 2013. Spending on nonresidential structures has been undermined by investment cutbacks in the energy sector in response to the tumble in crude oil prices.
Outlays on private residential construction, however, rose 0.4 percent to their highest level since May 2008, reflecting gains in home building and a bump up in renovations.
Public construction outlays jumped advanced 1.6 percent to their highest level since November 2010. 
Spending on state and local government projects - the largest portion of the public sector segment - surged 2.2 percent to the highest level since September 2010. Federal government outlays dropped 4.7 percent, the biggest fall since January.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2015 04:33AM ET</span>",China and Asia on shaky ground as factories step back in July,"By Ian Chua
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Headwinds for the world's second-biggest economy intensified at the start of the third quarter, with manufacturing conditions in China deteriorating to their worst in two years in July and triggering fresh slides in global commodity prices.
Similar business activity surveys for Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia - all heavily reliant on Chinese demand - reflected varying degrees of weakness that is clouding hopes for a convincing global recovery in the second half of the year.
With Greece's latest debt squeeze resolved, for now, investors' focus will shift back to sluggish European growth and whether the U.S. economy has healed enough to withstand its first expected increase in interest rates since 2006.
As emerging economies appeared on track to post their smallest share of global growth in years, the hope is for continued recovery in the United States and Britain. Manufacturing surveys for both countries, along with Europe, are due later in the day. 
Both U.S. and UK data in recent weeks has been mixed, adding to doubts about whether they are on a sounder and sustainable footing.
""We believe the macro environment remains challenging for emerging market assets amid headwinds of low commodity prices, concerns over China and a looming Fed tightening cycle,""  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) strategists wrote in a daily note in clients.
China's factory activity shrank more than initially estimated in July as new orders fell, dashing hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be steadying, a private survey showed on Monday.
The final Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing PMI came in at 47.8 in July, from 49.4 in June, sinking deeper below the 50-mark that divides growth from contraction.
A similar official factory survey at the weekend was also weaker than expected, suggesting growth had stalled.
Both indicators signaled a slowdown in factory activity at a time when Beijing has been intervening heavily to prevent a full-blown crash in the country's stock markets.
""My view is that they are distorted numbers due to the stock market panic. If that's the case, it's a transitory dip and given the amount of stimulus that has been put in place, we should expect a bounce back in the August numbers,"" said ING economist Tim Condon.
""But the economy can hardly afford much of a headwind, so probably it brings forward the timing of when people expect the next (policy) move from the authorities.""
China's central bank has already cut interest rates four times since November and repeatedly loosened restrictions on bank lending in its most aggressive stimulus campaign since the global financial crisis.
Analysts at Nomura expect another 50-basis-point cut in banks' reserve ratio and one more quarter-point easing in interest rates, likely in August.
Yet, a senior Chinese central bank official predicted that downward pressure on the economy will persist in the second half of the year, saying growth in infrastructure spending and exports were unlikely to pick up.
The frosty state of China saw South Korean exports fall for a seventh month in July, while economic growth in Taiwan cooled to its slowest in three years in the second quarter.
China's slowdown is also forcing Western companies to take a hard look at their businesses, leading many to reduce investments, costs and product lines.
""In terms of external demand, loose monetary conditions and lower energy prices should support a pick-up in global activity in the coming quarters,"" Krystal Tan, Asian economist at Capital Economics wrote in a report.
""However, the pace of recovery is likely to be gradual, suggesting a strong rebound in Asia's export performance is still some way away."" 
Providing a bit of relief, manufacturing activity in Japan and India both picked up in July thanks to new orders, though analysts questioned if the momentum can be sustained.
Japan's Manufacturing PMI climbed to a five-month high of 51.2, from 50.1, while India's Manufacturing PMI rose to a six-month high of 52.7, from 51.3.
""While this is a generally positive set of data, upcoming PMI data releases will indicate whether the manufacturing sector can sustain this momentum,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit and author of the Indian PMI survey.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2015 01:27AM ET</span>",Weaker China factories argue for more policy support as stocks swoon,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity shrank more than initially estimated in July, contracting the most in two years as new orders fell and dashing hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be steadying, a private survey showed on Monday.
The report followed a downbeat official survey on Saturday which showed growth at manufacturing firms unexpectedly stalled, reinforcing views that the struggling economy needs more stimulus even as it faces fresh risks from a stock market slump.
Fears of a full-blown market crash have added a new sense of urgency for policymakers in Beijing, with many analysts expecting more support measures to be rolled out within weeks.
The final, private Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in July, the lowest since July 2013, from 49.4 in June.
That was worse than a preliminary reading of 48.2 and marked the fifth straight month of contraction.
New orders contracted after growing in June, while factory output shrank for the third consecutive month to hit a trough of 47.1, a level not seen in more than 3-1/2 years.
Deteriorating conditions forced companies to cut staffing for the 21st straight month, and factories had to reduce selling prices to a six-month low due to increasing competition.
Yet some economists warned against reading too much into the gloomy July data, arguing that the factory weakness may be transitory. For one, summer storms in the manufacturing hubs of Zhejiang and Guangdong may have dented output, they said.
And while companies that had invested in the stock market were shaken by the rout, history has shown that falling share prices don't affect real spending in China, they said.
""When stocks were rising rapidly, consumption did not pick up,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics, citing China's recent equity rally and that in 2007/08.
Instead, China's retail spending grew faster after share prices slumped in 2007/08, he said. ""The wealth effect is not evident in China.""
While soft global demand could continue to weigh on China's exports, market watchers like Evans-Pritchard believe increased government infrastructure spending and further policy easing should support domestic consumption in coming months, ensuring the economy meets the government's 7-percent growth target for the year.
Still, the factory outlook looks sluggish at best.
The official factory Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was also weaker than expected, falling to 50.0 in July from June's tepid growth reading of 50.2. The official survey focuses more on larger firms, which will likely benefit more from big infrastructure projects than smaller companies.
While growth in the services sector picked up slightly, offsetting some of the drag from persistent factory weakness, services companies rang alarm bells, too, reporting that new orders were cooling and they were cutting jobs at a faster pace.
A DIFFICULT SIX MONTHS
To be sure, even some within the Chinese government are less upbeat about the economic outlook.
Sheng Songcheng, director of the statistics division at the central bank, said that downward pressure on the economy will persist in the second-half of the year, adding that growth in exports and investment is not likely to pick up.
His guarded view resonates with some companies as well.
China Glass Holdings Ltd on Friday became the latest in a growing list of firms to issue profit warnings due to weak demand, saying it expected a first-half loss.
 China's slowdown is also forcing many Western companies to take a hard look at their businesses there, leading many to reduce investments and costs.
""We had five fabulous years in China where we grew strong double-digits, and it has been gradually slowing. Currently, in China we had negative order intake,"" Frans van Houten, chief of Dutch electronics group Philips NV (AS:PHG) said last week.
""We need to be much more modest on expectations with regard to China growth; that's just being realistic,"" he said.
Share markets across Asia including Shanghai (SSEC) fell on Monday and global prices of commodities such as copper and crude oil skidded on worries about the Chinese economy.
MORE SUPPORT MEASURES
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has already cut interest rates four times since November and repeatedly loosened restrictions on bank lending in its most aggressive stimulus campaign since the global financial crisis.
Beijing has also intervened heavily recently to stabilize stock markets, which has raised questions over its commitment to free-market reforms seen as essential for its transition from an export-led economy to one based on consumption.
While there is little evidence yet that the 30-percent stock market slump since mid-June has hit spending, analysts say wild price swings will rattle consumer and business confidence and could dampen activity in the financial services sector.
Buffeted by softening investment growth, unsteady domestic and foreign demand and a cooling housing market, China's growth is widely expected to grind to its lowest in a quarter of a century this year at 7 percent, from 7.4 percent in 2014.
After months of weakness, industrial output, retail sales and investment all grew slightly more than expected in June, raising hopes that earlier policy easing was finally starting to pay off. July data will be released over the next two weeks.
In an acknowledgement of difficulties ahead, the Politburo, one of the Communist Party's elite ruling bodies, promised last week to step up policy adjustments to keep growth stable.
Even if the stock market steadies, Tim Condon from ING Group in Singapore said Beijing will still need a continued housing market turnaround to hit its 7 percent growth target for 2015.

However, while home sales and prices are improving slowly in bigger cities after a year-long slump, a massive overhang of unsold homes could keep real estate under pressure well into next year, deterring developers from starting new construction and depressing demand for materials from cement to steel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs in the second quarter recorded their smallest increase in 33 years as workers earned less in commissions and bonuses, in what appeared to be a temporary wage growth setback against the backdrop of diminishing labor market slack.
The surprisingly smaller rise reported by the Labor Department on Friday did little to temper expectations that the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates later this year. The job market is fast approaching full employment.
""Labor market fundamentals are improving, job openings are at record highs, and slack on a steady downtrend. This is precisely how the Fed will interpret this report, even if the numbers here are atrocious,"" said Eric Green, chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, edged up 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Labor Department said. That was the smallest gain since the series started in the second quarter of 1982 and followed a 0.7 percent rise in the first quarter.
The weakness in compensation was concentrated in sales, information and wholesale trade, occupations where workers are likely to receive incentive pay. Commissions and bonuses helped lift worker compensation at the start of the year.
Excluding commissions, compensation was up 0.6 percent in both the first and second quarters, according to TD Securities.
Economists had forecast the employment cost index, widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack, rising 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
At 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate is close to the 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
That tightening of the labor market, which is expected to eventually translate into faster wage growth, has helped to hold consumer sentiment at lofty levels over the past eight months.
SENTIMENT STILL HIGH
In a separate report, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped to 93.1 in July from 96.1 in June. Still, the index was up 13.8 percent compared to July of last year.
Households expected their incomes to rise over the next two years, in sharp contrast with another confidence survey published earlier this week that had suggested a deterioration in consumers' perceptions of the labor market.
""On balance, the Michigan survey suggests that consumer sentiment remains broadly stable,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were marginally higher, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt rose.
In the second quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.2 percent. That was also the smallest increase on record and followed a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter.
Private sector compensation failed to rise for the first time on record. Compensation in the services sector nudged up 0.1 percent in the second quarter after rising 0.6 percent in the prior period.
Compensation in the goods producing sector rose a solid 0.7 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
""If we took this as a sign of things to come in the labor market, we might have to rethink the timing and pace of Fed rate hikes. However, this report seems to be out of tune with other indicators and anecdotal evidence,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
In the 12 months through June, labor costs rose 2.0 percent, the smallest 12-month increase since last year and a further slip below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent medium-term target.
Benefits rose 0.1 percent in the second quarter, but economists said that was mostly because of changes to the definition of retirement benefits.
A third report from MNI Chicago showed factory activity in the Midwest jumped to a six-month high in July. The Chicago Business Barometer rose to 54.7, the first gain since April, from June's reading of 49.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector.
Both production and new orders expanded at the fastest pace since the beginning of the year. A special survey question on wage growth showed that 40 percent of respondents said wages had grown by 1 percent to 2 percent over the past year.

About 19 percent of respondents reported wages were up 3 percent to 4 percent and nearly a quarter said that wage growth was unchanged over the year.

The University of Michigan's final July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 93.1, down from 96.1 in June. It was lower than the survey's preliminary reading of 93.3.

The final reading was the lowest since May and was below the median forecast of 94.0 among economists polled by Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter as solid consumer spending offset the drag from weak business spending on equipment, suggesting a steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. First-quarter GDP, previously reported to have shrunk at a 0.2 percent pace, was revised up to show it rising at a 0.6 percent rate.
""This was a very constructive report and given the supportive domestic economic backdrop, we expect this positive momentum in activity to be sustained in the coming months, providing the Fed with the necessary justification to raise rates this year - perhaps as early as September,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
The revision to first-quarter growth reflected steps taken by the government to refine the seasonal adjustment for some components of GDP, which economists said left residual seasonality in the data, as well as new source data. 
The report also showed a pick-up in inflation during the quarter, which economists say keeps the Fed on track for its first interest rate hike since 2006. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday described the economy as expanding ""moderately"" while upgrading its view of the labor market and saying housing had shown ""additional"" improvement. 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 267,000. However, claims remained near their cycle lows.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt were mixed. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
The economy grew 1.5 percent in the first half compared to 1.9 percent during the same period in 2014. Though second-quarter GDP growth was a bit below economists' expectations for a 2.6 percent rate, the growth composition pointed to firming domestic fundamentals. 
A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government expenditures, increased at a solid 2.5 percent rate after rising at a 2.0 percent pace at the start of the year. 
Growth in the second quarter was boosted by consumer spending as households used some of the windfall from cheaper gasoline in late 2014 and early this year to go shopping. The strengthening labor market also encouraged consumers to loosen their purse strings.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 2.9 percent rate from a 1.8 percent pace in the first quarter. The saving rate fell to 4.8 percent from 5.2 percent.
ENERGY DRAG PERSISTS
The economy also got a lift from housing, exports, and state and local government spending. However, the energy sector continued to weigh on growth as it struggles with the lingering effects of deep spending cuts by oil-field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year.
Business investment on equipment fell at a 4.1 percent rate.
Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts plunged at a 68.2 percent rate, the largest decline since the second quarter of 1986. This category dropped at a 44.5 percent pace in the first quarter. But there are signs that the energy spending rout might be nearing an end. 
Data last Friday showed U.S. energy firms added 21 oil rigs last week, marking the third increase over the past 33 weeks. Schlumberger said last week it believed the North American rig count may be bottoming and that a slow rise in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year.
Exports rebounded in the second quarter, despite a strong dollar, while imports rose moderately. That left a smaller trade deficit that added 0.13 percentage point to GDP growth. 
While businesses accumulated $110.0 billion worth of merchandise, down from $112.8 billion in the first quarter, inventories are still high and could hurt growth in the third quarter.
The sturdy pace of consumer spending and a rise in oil prices pushed up inflation in the second quarter. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at a 2.2 percent rate, the fastest since early 2012, after falling at a 1.9 percent rate in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, prices increased at a 1.8 percent pace.
""The stronger recent core PCE number probably makes this report a little bit hawkish for Fed considerations,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. houses unexpectedly fell in June after five straight months of increase, suggesting some cooling in home resales activity after recent hefty gains.
The decline in contracts, which came on the heels of reports showing the pace of home price appreciation stalling in major cities and new home sales dropping, did little to change perceptions that the housing market recovery was on track given a tightening labor market.
""The June decline is a hiccup. It is important to bear in mind that there is still plenty of fundamental support for the housing market,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, declined 1.8 percent to 110.3.
Still, the index was the third highest reading for this year and contracts were up 8.2 percent from a year ago.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's drop pointed to a pause in sales of existing homes after they reached a near 8-1/2-year high in June.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 1.0 percent last month.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. The housing index (HGX) was up 0.97 percent.
The U.S. central bank's statement will be scrutinized for clues on the timing of the first rate hike, which is expected later this year. The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
While contracts to buy a previously owned home and new home sales fell last month, and the pace of house price increases stalled in May, other housing market indicators such as groundbreaking on new projects, building permits and builder confidence have painted a bullish picture for housing.
""We would interpret the June weakness as payback after housing activity made a strong start to 2015 and expect the housing market to remain in recovery mode,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
A strengthening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, is driving demand for housing, particularly among young adults. A large portion of that is going into the rental market, boosting construction of multi-family homes.
A report on Tuesday showed the rental vacancy rate in the second quarter fell to its lowest level since the mid-1980s. Economists say sky-rocketing rents will soon make home buying a more attractive option for Americans.
Last month, home purchase contracts edged up 0.4 percent in the Northeast and gained 0.5 percent in the West. They declined 3.0 percent in both the South and the Midwest.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, declined 1.8 percent to 110.3. Still, the index was the third highest reading for this year.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's drop pointed to a pause in home resales after they reached a near 9-year high in May. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 1.0 percent last month.
The decline in contracts comes on the heels of a drop in new home sales. Still, that will probably not change views the housing market recovery was back on track given a tightening labor market. Other housing market indicators such as groundbreaking on new projects, building permits and builder confidence have painted a bullish picture for housing.
Pending home sales rose 8.2 percent from a year ago.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.8% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.0%. Pending home sales in May rose by 0.6%, whose figure was revised down from a previously reported gain of 0.9%.
Modest gains in the Northeast and West were offset by larger declines in the Midwest and South.
Despite June's decline, pending home sales remained near the highest level in over nine years.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 11.1% in June, below forecasts for an increase of 12.0% and following a gain of 7.9% in May.
The index is the third highest reading of 2015 and has now increased year-over-year for ten consecutive months.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says although pending sales decreased in June, the overall trend in recent months supports a solid pace of home sales this summer.
""Competition for existing houses on the market remained stiff last month, as low inventories in many markets reduced choices and pushed prices above some buyers' comfort level,"" he said.

""Our models suggest that the real exchange rate is currently in the vicinity of its long-run equilibrium value - if growth, inflation, and the terms of trade were at their long-run trends. However, the exchange rate remains above the level consistent with current economic conditions and, in particular, the current low level of export prices,"" Wheeler said in a speech delivered to ExportNZ in Tauranga, New Zealand.
The current account deficit level is expected to become larger over the next two years based on recent New Zealand dollar level and terms of trade, he said.
""At current levels of export prices, a more substantial exchange rate depreciation is therefore required to stabilise the net external liabilities position relative to GDP,"" he said.
 On monetary policy, Wheeler repeated what the RBNZ said in the Official Cash Rate statement last week when rates were cut 25 basis points to 3%.
""To maintain growth around potential and return CPI inflation to its medium-term target level, some further monetary policy easing is likely to be required,"" he said.
He said the RBNZ is conscious of the impact of low interest rates on housing demand and the potential for it to feed into higher house price inflation.
The RBNZ continues to be concerned about the financial stability risks and risks to the broader economy that would be associated with a major correction in Auckland house prices, Wheeler said he expects macro-prudential policy to be helpful in reducing some of the pressure from Auckland housing market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence suffered its biggest blow in four years in July on a less upbeat jobs outlook, while home appreciation in major cities stalled in May, suggesting a spring pause in housing demand.
The disappointing data comes as Federal Reserve policymakers meet to consider whether the U.S. economy is strong enough to warrant an end to the Fed's near zero interest rate policy, perhaps as soon as September. 
The Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank's policy-setting group, is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Conference Board, an industry group, said on Tuesday its index of consumer attitudes fell to 90.9 this month from a downwardly revised 99.8 in June. It fell far short of a forecast reading of 100.0. 
The latest figure was the lowest since September 2014, while the decline was the steepest since August 2011. The report's jobs hard-to-get index rose to 26.7 from June's upwardly adjusted 26.1. 
Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said the slump in confidence likely reflected recent upheavals in the global economy.
""This seems to be an aberration,"" he said. ""Consumers were probably freaked out by the problems in Greece and the Chinese stock market, and the volatility on Wall Street."" 
Wall Street stock prices and the dollar rose after briefly paring gains on the disappointing consumer confidence data. U.S. Treasuries prices fell on renewed appetite for stocks. (N) [FRX/] [US/]
HOME PRICE RISE STALLS
Other data on Tuesday showed the acceleration in home prices lost steam in the spring, but there were encouraging signs for first-time buyers.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas in May rose 4.9 percent year over year, matching the pace in April. Economists polled by Reuters had projected a stronger 5.6 percent increase.
Rising home values have bolstered homeowners' balance sheets, but higher house prices and lackluster wage gains have made it difficult for many people to buy a home. The U.S. home ownership rate dropped to 63.5 percent in the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, the lowest level since the series began in 1980, Commerce Department data showed.
Increasing household formation and an improving labor market, however, are expected to pull more first-time buyers into the market. On Tuesday, No. 1 U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton, which mainly caters to first-time buyers, said its quarterly profit almost doubled from a year ago as orders jumped.
Analysts said indicators showing improvement in the housing and job sectors would allow the FOMC to consider normalizing interest rate from the emergency low level it adopted in December 2008 during the global financial crisis.
""As long as the general tone of the data shows improvement and inflation is moving toward its 2 percent target, they will feel comfortable to raise rates in September,"" Moody's Sweet said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment plans rebounded solidly in June after two straight months of declines, suggesting the drag on manufacturing from capital spending cuts was starting to ebb. 
The signs of a slight improvement in factory activity are a boost to the economic growth outlook heading into the second half of the year and support views the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year. 
""This could be a sign that manufacturing activity is starting to pick up again following the weak start to the year,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Monday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.9 percent last month after dropping 0.4 percent in May. Economists had expected these so-called core capital goods to increase 0.4 percent in June. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report as an 8.5 percent plunge in Chinese stocks overnight sparked concerns about the global economy. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, while prices for U.S. government debt rose on safe-haven bids. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates in September. The Fed has kept its short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008. 
Deep investment spending cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year have weighed on factory activity. But there are signs that the energy spending rout is nearing an end.
Data on Friday showed U.S. energy firms added 21 oil rigs last week, marking the third increase over the past 33 weeks and bringing the total rig count to its highest since late May.
 Schlumberger Ltd  (N:SLB), the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider said last week it believed the North American rig count may be bottoming and that a slow rise in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year.
Schlumberger and rival Halliburton (N:HAL) have slashed their capital expenditure budgets for this year.
GLIMMERS OF HOPE 
Pointing to some moderation in the impact of weak energy spending on manufacturing, the Dallas Fed, in a separate report on Monday, said its general business activity index improved for a second straight month in July. The index, however, remained in negative territory.
Even if the energy drag on manufacturing eases, activity will continue to be constrained by a strong dollar and slow global demand, which have hurt profits of multinational corporations such as Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT). The dollar has gained 14.6 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014. 
""A base appears to be forming in orders, but it remains to be seen how reliable it is,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product
measurement, slipped 0.1 percent in June after a 0.3 percent fall in May. 
While that suggests business spending probably weighed on second-quarter GDP, that is likely to be offset by strong inventory growth. A Reuters survey forecast second-quarter growth expanding at a 2.6 percent annual pace after output contracted at a 0.2 percent rate at the start of the year.
The government will release its second-quarter GDP snapshot on Thursday.
An 8.9 percent jump in transportation equipment boosted overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which increased 3.4 percent last month.
Transportation was buoyed by a 66.1 percent surge in aircraft orders, which reversed May's 31.6 percent plunge. Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website that it had received 161 orders last month, up from only 11 in May.
Orders for automobiles and parts edged up 0.2 percent after slipping 0.3 percent the prior month. Durable goods inventories increased 0.4 percent, the largest gain since last December, after falling 0.2 percent in May.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2015 11:32AM ET</span>",New home sales at seven-month low; manufacturing stabilizes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales fell in June to their lowest level in seven months and May's sales were revised sharply lower, in what appeared to be a minor setback for the housing market recovery.
Other data on Friday showed manufacturing activity nudged up in July after slowing for three straight months.
New home sales dropped 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000 units, the lowest level since last November, the Commerce Department said. May's sales pace was revised down to 517,000 units from the previously reported 546,000 units.
""You never want to see the data regress, but we remain optimistic that we're still on a long-term upward trajectory,"" said Tom Wind, vice president of home lending at EverBank in Jacksonville, Florida.
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for 8.1 percent of the market, to be unchanged last month. Sales were up 18.1 percent compared to June of last year.
Prices for U.S. government debt rose after the data and the dollar pared gains against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes were trading lower.
Despite two straight months of declines in new home sales, the overall housing market recovery remains intact.
Housing is being supported by a tightening labor market, which has unleashed demand from young adults. Steps by the government to ease lending conditions for first-time buyers through mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also are helping.
A report on Wednesday showed home resales jumped to a more than eight-year high in June. Data last week showed building permits near an eight-year peak in June and housing starts increasing solidly.
New home sales increased 28 percent in the Northeast after soaring 78.6 percent in May. Sales fell 17 percent in the West and were down 11.1 percent in the Midwest. In the South, sales slipped 4.1 percent.
The stock of new houses for sale increased 3.4 percent to 215,000 last month, the highest since May 2010. Supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom and is not keeping up with rising household formation.
At June's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since last November. That was up from 4.8 months in May. The median price of a new home fell 1.8 percent from a year ago to $281,800.
In a separate report, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in July from a reading of 53.6 in June, which was the slowest pace since October 2013.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Job creation, however, slowed in July with the index at 53.7, its weakest level since April, compared with the final June reading of 55.5, Markit said.

The index's flash output component rose to 55.4 from the final June reading of 53.9. The June final output level was the lowest since January 2014, according to Markit data.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 18 fell by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000 from the previous week’s total of 281,000. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 280,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 20 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 11 declined to 2.207 million from 2.216 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.225 million.
The four-week moving average was 278,750, a decrease of 4,000 from the previous week’s total of 282,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.0995 from around 1.1014 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.5598 from 1.5607 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 123.94 from 123.84 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 97.19, compared to 97.04 ahead of the report.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2015 11:55AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims lowest since 1973; leading index rises,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week dropped to its lowest level in more than 41-1/2 years, suggesting the labor market maintained a sturdy pace of job growth in July. 
Other data on Thursday also offered an upbeat assessment of the economy. A gauge of future economic activity increased solidly in June and another measure suggested growth picked up slightly last month. 
The bullish jobs picture, together with a firming housing market brings the Federal Reserve a step closer to hike interest rates this year. 
""This should reassure policymakers that their objective of maximum employment is coming closer into view,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000 for the week ended July 18, the lowest level since November 1973, the Labor Department said. 
However, last week's drop likely exaggerates the strength of the labor market as claims are volatile during summer when automakers usually shut assembly plants for annual retooling. 
Some firms keep production lines running, which can throw off a model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal variations. A Labor Department analyst, however, said there were no special factors influencing the data.
Still, the decline unwound the increase in claims in June. 
The dollar was trading weaker against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries fell marginally. 
Technology shares on Wall Street rebounded from the prior sessions' losses, while the rest of the market was little changed after weak earnings from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker, and diversified technology firm 3M (N:MMM). 
Fed officials meet next week, but they are not expected to tighten monetary policy before September. The Fed has kept its short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008.
FIRMING TREND
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 278,500 last week. 
""We believe that retooling shutdowns were likely much smaller in 2015 than in previous years due to lower auto inventories and very strong vehicle sales,"" said Cheng Chen, an economist at TD Securities in New York. 
As such, that would suggest an acceleration in motor vehicle assembly this month, which would support the struggling manufacturing sector and lift industrial production.
The claims data covered the survey week for the nonfarm payrolls portion of July's employment report.
Though the four-week average of claims increased 1,500 between the June and July survey periods, payroll growth likely remained above the 200,000 threshold this month.
The four-week moving average of claims has been below the key 300,000 mark, which is normally associated with sturdy job gains, for 17 straight weeks - an unusually long stretch.
Payrolls increased 223,000 in June after rising 254,000 in May. Job growth has exceeded 200,000 in 14 of the last 16 months and at 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate is close to the 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index rose 0.6 percent last month after advancing 0.8 percent in May. The increase reflected the strengthening housing market, which has been characterized by a surge in housing starts and building permits, as well as very strong sales. 
The upbeat growth picture was also supported by another report from the Chicago Fed, which showed its National Activity Index rising to +0.08 in June after five straight months of negative readings. The gain was led by improvements in production and employment related indicators.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today reduced the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.0 percent.
Global economic growth remains moderate, with only a gradual pickup in activity forecast. Recent developments in China and Europe led to heightened uncertainty and increased financial market volatility. Particular uncertainty remains around the impact of the expected tightening in US monetary policy.
New Zealand’s economy is currently growing at an annual rate of around 2.5 percent, supported by low interest rates, construction activity, and high net immigration. However, the growth outlook is now softer than at the time of the June Statement. Rebuild activity in Canterbury appears to have peaked, and the world price for New Zealand’s dairy exports has fallen sharply.
Headline inflation is currently below the Bank’s 1 to 3 percent target range, due largely to previous strength in the New Zealand dollar and a large decline in world oil prices. Annual CPI inflation is expected to be close to the midpoint of the range in early 2016, due to recent exchange rate depreciation and as the decline in oil prices drops out of the annual figure. A key uncertainty is how quickly the exchange rate pass-through will occur.
House prices in Auckland continue to increase rapidly, but, outside Auckland, house price inflation generally remains low. Increased building activity is underway in the Auckland region, but it will take some time for the imbalances in the housing market to be corrected.
The New Zealand dollar has declined significantly since April and, along with lower interest rates, has led to an easing in monetary conditions. While the currency depreciation will provide support to the export and import competing sectors, further depreciation is necessary given the weakness in export commodity prices.
A reduction in the OCR is warranted by the softening in the economic outlook and low inflation. At this point, some further easing seems likely.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose in June to their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years, a sign of pent-up demand that should buoy the housing market recovery and likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales increased 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.49 million units, the highest level since February 2007. 
""The economy really has the wind at its back now,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Home resales this year are on track to record their biggest gain in eight years, the NAR said. 
Economists had forecast sales rising to an annual rate of 5.40 million units last month. Sales were up 9.6 percent from a year ago.
June's solid home sales report came on the heels of last week's strong housing starts and building permits data. A tightening labor market is starting to push up wages, helping to boost demand for housing, especially among young adults. 
But a tight supply of properties for sale remains a constraint. The string of strong housing reports indicate the economy continues to be on firmer footing despite a drop in retail sales and a slowdown in job growth last month.
The housing index (HGX) rose 1.4 percent on the data, outperforming the overall stock market, which dropped after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) late on Tuesday gave a fourth-quarter revenue forecast that fell short of estimates and also missed some targets for iPhone sales. 
Shares in D.R. Horton (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, rose 2.4 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) was trading 2.3 percent higher. The dollar gained against a basket of currencies while prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose. 
PRICES SURGE
""Strong home resale numbers throughout the spring and into summer are welcome news to those who feared the housing market was a weak point in the overall economy,"" said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit. 
""As housing numbers trend more positive, the Fed will become increasingly comfortable in beginning to raise rates."" 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association suggested sales could increase further as applications for home purchase loans rose 1 percent last week from a week earlier.
The NAR said home sales last month were likely boosted by buyers rushing into the market to beat rising mortgage rates, but it added that strong economic fundamentals were the main driver. Those who already own a home accounted for the bulk of transactions in June, with the share of first-time buyers slipping a bit.
First-time homebuyers accounted for 30 percent of the sales, down from 32 percent in May. It was the fourth straight month that this segment remained at or near 30 percent, although it remained well below the 40 percent to 45 percent that economists and realtors say is required for a robust housing market.
Economists expect that housing will soften the drag on the economy from manufacturing, which continues to struggle with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector, and contribute to growth this year.
Still, housing gains continue to be curbed by a shortage of properties for sale. Residential construction has accelerated but is not keeping up with household formation, which should keep homebuilders busy.
Last month, the stock of unsold homes on the market rose 0.9 percent from May to 2.30 million units. Supply was up only 0.4 percent from a year ago. 
Homes sold in June typically were on the market for 34 days, the shortest amount of time since May 2011. In addition, the share of distressed sales, foreclosures and short sales, was the smallest since last August. 
At June's sales pace, it would take 5.0 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.1 months in May. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
With supply well below what it was during the housing bubble in 2006, the median price for a previously owned home increased 6.5 percent from a year ago to a record $236,400.

While some buyers may be forced out of the market by higher prices, homeowners are seeing their equity rise. That could lead to more houses being put up for sale. Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2015 10:35AM ET</span>",NRF cuts 2015 U.S. retail sales forecast after weak first half,"(Reuters) - The National Retail Federation, the biggest U.S. retail association, cut its forecast for retail sales growth in the country this year, citing an unexpected slowdown in growth in the first half of the year.
The NRF now expects U.S. retail sales to grow 3.5 percent in 2015, lower than the 4.1 percent growth it forecast in February. NRF said sales grew 2.9 percent during the first half of 2015 and are expected to grow 3.7 percent over the next five months.
"" ... A deflationary retail environment has been especially challenging for retailers' bottom lines,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. 
Kleinhenz said the weak first half sales were due to bad weather through most of the winter, the West Coast ports disruptions and a stronger dollar among other factors.
Even recent government data points to weak sales. U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in June, recording the weakest since February, as households cut back on purchases, according to the latest data from the Commerce Department.
NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay also blamed Washington for lackluster consumer spending. "" ... Too much time has been spent crafting rules and regulations that almost guarantee negative consequences for consumers and American businesses alike.""
Retailers across the board recorded sluggish sales in the first half of the year, with apparel retailers among the worst hit.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), the world's largest retailer, said its customers were preferring to pocket savings from tax refunds and lower gas prices than spend.
Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) said gasoline price deflation ate into domestic sales, while department stores such as Macy's Inc (N:M) and Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) took a hit from unusual weather and port disruptions.
The stronger dollar through most of the year so far also hurt domestic sales. Macy's and Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) said the strong dollar meant that tourists spent less.
However, home improvement giant  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) capitalized on the storms and winter months with better-timed promotions that boosted sales and profit.
Households seemed to be spending more on services than on goods, Kleinhenz said.
NRF's calculations include general retail sales and non-store sales, and exclude automobiles, gas stations and restaurants.

The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index <.SPLRCD>, which includes auto parts makers and restaurants, had risen nearly 10 percent this year up to Tuesday's close.

Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says backed by June's solid gain in closings, this year's spring buying season has been the strongest since the downturn.

The minutes showed all nine members were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5% and making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.
According to the minutes, a number of policymakers see rising inflation risks.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that the decision to raise interest rates from record lows will come into sharper focus around the end of 2015, his strongest hint yet about the timing of the British central bank's next move.
Most market players expect the BOE to begin slowly raising interest rates in mid-2016.

""The question of whether (cash rates) might be reduced further remains, as I have said before, on the table,"" Governor Glenn Stevens said in a speech.
Risk-taking behavior most responsive to monetary policy is of the financial type - which is fine up to a point because it is a prerequisite for the ""real economy"" risk-taking wanted, Stevens said.

International Economic Conditions
The Board's discussion about economic conditions opened with the observation that economic growth in Australia's major trading partners appeared to have been around average in the June quarter. Consumption growth had been little changed for most trading partners in recent months, although it was perhaps a bit stronger in the United States and somewhat weaker in China. The level of consumption in Japan remained well below that seen prior to the increase in the consumption tax in 2014. Core inflation rates had been stable in year-ended terms over recent months and remained below the targets of most central banks. Members also observed that trade volumes, particularly within the Asian region, appeared to have fallen recently. Consistent with this observation, growth in industrial production across a number of east Asian economies had slowed a little.
In China, there had been little change in the monthly indicators of economic activity, although conditions had been a bit more positive in some sectors than early in 2015. The Chinese property market had improved somewhat; residential property prices overall had risen for the first time in a year and floor space sold had increased in the past few months. Members reflected that the recent easing in monetary conditions would provide additional support to the property market and growth more broadly, although it could be some time before a significant pick-up in construction activity began. Recent efforts by central government authorities to increase infrastructure investment further and reform local government financing arrangements were also expected to support investment.
Commodity prices overall had fallen since the previous meeting, driven by iron ore and oil prices. Growth in crude steel production had been modest and steel prices had fallen noticeably over the past month. Iron ore production in China had continued to decline. Shipments of iron ore from Australia and Brazil appeared to have increased in June, which contributed to lower iron ore prices over the past month.
Following quite strong output growth in Japan in the March quarter, more timely indicators pointed to modest growth in the June quarter. Labour market conditions had continued to improve, resulting in the unemployment rate falling further and the ratio of jobs to applicants continuing to rise. Wage growth and financial market measures of inflation expectations were higher than a year earlier and were expected to feed into higher core inflation over time. Members considered the importance for Japan of policy reforms designed to address some longer-term structural challenges, such as the ageing of the population.
In the United States, recent data pointed to moderate growth in economic activity in the June quarter following weakness in the March quarter. The labour market had strengthened further, with growth in non-farm payrolls employment rebounding in April and May and the unemployment rate falling. While there had been some increase in measures of wage growth, core measures of inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's inflation target.
In the euro area, the available indicators pointed to modest economic growth and above-average sentiment in the June quarter, continuing the recent trend of improved conditions in the euro area as a whole. Members noted that exports had made a significant contribution to the pick-up in growth in the region but investment was still well below the levels seen prior to the global financial crisis. The unemployment rate had continued to fall modestly since its peak two years earlier, but varied sharply across the euro area; the unemployment rate was highest in Greece, where output was more than 25 per cent below its level prior to the financial crisis.
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that output had increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.3 per cent over the year. Resource exports had made a significant contribution to growth, reflecting better-than-usual weather conditions in the quarter. Dwelling investment had remained strong and while consumption growth had picked up over the past year or so, it had remained below average. Business investment had contracted in the quarter and there had been little growth in public demand. More recent economic indicators suggested that domestic demand had continued to grow at a below-average pace over recent months, but that labour market conditions had continued to improve.
Members observed that consumption grew faster than household income over the year to the March quarter. As a result, the saving ratio had declined further, although it remained well above the level it had been over much of the past 25 years. Year-ended growth in retail sales had been little changed over recent months and liaison suggested that this was likely to have continued into June. Retail sales growth had been relatively strong in New South Wales and Victoria but weaker in Queensland and Western Australia, in line with observed differences in economic conditions across the country. At the same time, surveys indicated that consumers had viewed their financial situation as being above average over the past year, notwithstanding the relatively weak growth in labour incomes. Members observed that this was likely to reflect the very low level of interest rates and strong growth in net household wealth.
Dwelling investment increased by 9 per cent over the year to the March quarter. An increase in the construction of new dwellings accounted for most of this growth, but the alterations and additions component had also contributed more recently, recording the first increase in a year in the March quarter. Forward-looking indicators pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment in the period ahead. Members noted that there had been ongoing divergence in conditions in established housing markets across the country, as well as between houses and apartments. Housing prices had continued to rise rapidly in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Elsewhere, there had been little change in housing prices over the past six months or so. Prices of apartments had been growing less rapidly than those of houses, which members considered to be consistent with the relatively strong growth in the supply of higher-density housing in many capital cities.
Growth in housing credit overall had been stable over recent months at around 7 per cent on an annualised basis, while growth in lending to investors had been steady at a bit above 10 per cent. Members observed that the household debt-to-income ratio, calculated by netting funds held in mortgage offset accounts from total household debt to the financial sector, had increased over the year to March but had not exceeded previous peaks. Members discussed the fact that high housing prices had different implications for existing home owners, who benefited from increased wealth, and potential new home owners, who were finding it more difficult to finance a home purchase.
Investment in both the mining and non-mining sectors appeared to have fallen in the March quarter, although the split between the two components remained subject to some uncertainty. Profits for non-mining firms had increased by 6 per cent over the past year. More recent survey measures of business conditions, confidence and capacity utilisation had picked up to be around, or even above, their long-run averages. In contrast, private non-residential building approvals had remained weak.
The monthly trade data suggested that resource exports, including iron ore and coal, had declined in the June quarter. Coal exports had been affected by the severe storms in the Hunter region of New South Wales in late April. Members noted that there had been further signs of growth in service exports, in part a response to the depreciation of the exchange rate. Over the past year, net service exports had made a similar contribution to output growth as exports of iron ore, even though total import volumes had increased in the March quarter.
Labour force data indicated further signs of improvement in May. Employment growth had picked up over the year to exceed the rate of population growth. As a result, the unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of 2014 and had fallen slightly in May to 6 per cent. Members observed that employment growth had been strongest in household services and that employment and vacancies had been growing for business services but had remained little changed in the goods sector. As with other state-based indicators, employment growth and job vacancies had been strongest in New South Wales and Victoria. Forward-looking labour market indicators had been somewhat mixed over recent months. The ABS measure of firms' job vacancies overall suggested that demand for labour could be sufficient to maintain a stable or even falling unemployment rate in the near term, while other forward-looking indicators suggested only modest growth in employment in coming months.
Members noted that the latest estimates indicated that the population had increased by 1.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter, down from a peak rate of growth of 1.8 per cent over 2012. The slower growth was primarily accounted for by a decline in net immigration, which was particularly pronounced in Western Australia and Queensland, consistent with weaker economic conditions in those states. Members observed that the lower-than-expected growth in the population helped to reconcile the below-average growth in output over the past year with a broadly steady unemployment rate.
Despite recent improvements in labour market indicators, members reflected that there was still evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. Consistent with this, the latest national accounts data indicated that non-farm average earnings per hour had recorded the lowest year-ended outcomes since the early 1990s and that unit labour costs had been little changed for around four years.
Financial Markets
International financial markets were mainly focused on developments in Greece and the fall in Chinese equity markets over the past month.
Members were briefed on recent developments in Greece. The ‘no’ vote in the referendum on the creditors' latest proposals raised several issues, first among which was how the Greek authorities could reopen the banks. A critical vulnerability in the near term was related to whether the European Central Bank would provide additional emergency liquidity assistance. A second issue was how Greece would be able to service its external debt and a third was the challenges faced by the Greek authorities in improving the competitive position of the economy. Although these issues were of great concern to the Greek populace, the direct economic implications for the global economy and Australia were assessed by members to be relatively limited. They noted that the reaction of financial markets to these developments had been fairly muted. This was consistent with the economic and financial exposures to Greece – apart from the official sector's financial exposure – being quite low.
Members noted that spreads to 10-year German Bunds on comparable bonds issued by Italy, Spain and Portugal had not risen much, with the limited contagion from developments in Greece likely to have reflected a general view of markets that previous adjustment policies in those countries had been relatively successful.
Members then turned their discussion to developments in bond markets more generally. Yields on longer-maturity German Bunds and US Treasuries had risen sharply over the first half of June, with German 10-year yields reaching 1 per cent, compared with a historic low of 8 basis points in mid April. German yields declined somewhat following the announcement of the Greek referendum. Longer-term sovereign yields of most other developed countries, including Australia, tended to move in line with US Treasuries.
Expectations about the timing of the US Federal Reserve's first increase in the federal funds rate were little changed over the past month. Market pricing continued to suggest that the first increase would occur around the end of 2015. Although commentary by Federal Reserve officials suggested that it could be a little sooner than that, they continued to emphasise that the exact timing of the first increase would be less important than the pace of subsequent increases, which were expected to be gradual.
The People's Bank of China (PBC) eased monetary policy further in June by cutting benchmark deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points, citing low inflation and a consequent increase in real interest rates. In addition, the PBC announced cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for selected financial institutions. The Chinese authorities had also announced a proposal to allow banks more flexibility in their choice of funding mix and asset allocation, which could lead to an increase in the supply of credit over time.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25 per cent, citing the decline in New Zealand's terms of trade and the disinflationary effect of stronger-than-expected labour force growth.
Global equity markets fell by 3 per cent over the course of June, with broad-based falls and price movements generally tending to reflect fluctuations in sentiment about Greece. The Chinese equity market also fell sharply in June, partly in response to what was only a modest tightening of restrictions on margin lending. Mainland share prices were still well above their levels of a year earlier but the sharpness of the recent fall prompted the Chinese authorities to announce a number of measures, including an indefinite suspension of initial public offerings, an equity stabilisation fund and a funding facility for brokers. The Australian equity market underperformed several other advanced economy markets in June, mainly reflecting falls in resources and consumer sector share prices.
Global foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued in June. The euro recorded only a modest and short-lived fall when markets opened after the announcement of the Greek referendum result. The Australian dollar was 3 per cent lower against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis.
Corporate bond issuance in Australia had been strong over the course of 2015 to date, particularly by resource companies, although much of the increase reflected refinancing.
Pricing of Australian money market instruments suggested that the cash rate target was expected to remain unchanged at the present meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Members noted that global economic conditions remained consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners being around average over the period ahead. Global financial conditions were very accommodative and would remain so even in the event that the Federal Reserve started to raise its policy interest rate later in the year. Recent data suggested that conditions in Chinese property markets had improved and the authorities had acted to support activity by easing a range of policies further. Members noted that the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets and potential spillovers from developments in Greece would require close monitoring.
Domestically, the key forces shaping the economy over the past year were much as they had been for some time. Very low interest rates were working to support strong growth in dwelling investment and, together with strong housing prices, had supported consumption growth. Resource exports had made a substantial contribution to growth and mining investment had declined significantly, while public demand had been flat over the past year. Although output growth in the March quarter had been stronger than expected, growth over the year remained below average and early indications were that the strength in the March quarter had not carried through to the June quarter. Non-mining business investment had been subdued and surveys of businesses' investment intentions suggested that it would remain so over the coming year. Nevertheless, non-mining business profits had increased over the past year and surveys suggested that business conditions had generally improved over recent months to be a bit above average.
Conditions in the housing market had been little changed in the most recent months, with notable strength in Sydney. Housing credit growth had been steady and remained relatively strong for investors in housing, although it had not accelerated. Any effects of regulators' greater scrutiny of investor lending were probably not yet evident in the data.
Recent data indicated that employment had grown more rapidly than the population and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of the previous year. The easing in population growth over the past year helped to reconcile below-average growth in output with the relatively steady unemployment rate. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained, as evidenced by the level of the unemployment rate, historically low wage growth and unit labour costs that had been stable for a number of years. On this basis, members assessed that inflationary pressures were well contained and likely to remain so in the period ahead.
Commodity prices had fallen further and the Australian dollar had depreciated over the past month. Although the exchange rate against the US dollar was close to levels last seen in 2009, the decline in the Australian dollar had been more modest in terms of a basket of currencies. Members noted that the exchange rate had thus far offered less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy and that further depreciation seemed both likely and necessary.
In light of current and prospective economic circumstances and financial conditions, the Board judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate. Information to be received over the period ahead on economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers are finding it increasingly difficult to find skilled workers, according to a survey published on Monday, suggesting upward pressure on wage growth down the road.
The National Association for Business Economics' latest business conditions survey found that 35 percent of the 112 economists who participated reported their firms had seen shortages of skilled labor during the quarter ending in July.
That compared with only 25 percent in the April survey and marked a sharp pick-up from 22 percent during the July quarter last year.
""The panel reports markedly increased shortages in the July survey, especially of skilled labor,"" said survey Chairman Jim Diffley, who is also a senior director at IHS Economics.
The NABE survey is the latest to suggest a tightening labor market. Early in July, the National Federation of Independent Business said that 44 percent of small businesses looking to hire that month reported few or no qualified applicants for positions they were trying to fill.
Although job growth has accelerated and the unemployment rate has dropped to seven-year lows, that has not been accompanied by strong wage growth.
The NABE survey found the share of companies anticipating wage increases in the next three months grew to 49 percent from 46 percent in the April poll and 35 percent a year ago.
""As an economist watching the economy, we're somewhat surprised that wages pressures have been so muted to this point,"" Diffley told Reuters. ""We do expect an acceleration and in fact think it necessary to continue the recovery.""
The share of those reporting actual wage increases during the past three months remained at 42 percent, little changed from 43 percent a year ago but slightly down from 45 percent in April.

The economists surveyed represented a broad spectrum of businesses, including goods-producing, transportation, finance and services industries. Forty-seven percent of the firms employ more than 1,000 people.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2015 06:15PM ET</span>",German economy likely grew by around 0.3 percent in second-quarter: finance ministry,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy likely grew by around 0.3 percent in the second quarter, the finance ministry said on Monday, adding that the mood in corporate boardrooms remained largely optimistic despite the Greek debt crisis.
In the first quarter, growth in Europe's largest economy slowed to 0.3 percent, mainly due to weaker foreign trade, after an unexpectedly strong 0.7 percent expansion between October and December last year.
The finance ministry said in its monthly report that the German economy was in an upswing, with domestic demand remaining the key growth driver, but foreign trade also picking up.
""According to the latest economic data, gross domestic product (GDP) likely increased in the second quarter at a similar rate as in the previous quarter when it rose by 0.3 percent on a seasonally and price-adjusted basis,"" it added.
Demand and production in the industrial sector are on an upward trend and the mood among companies is good, the ministry said, adding that assessments of the business situation and outlook remained predominantly optimistic.
The ministry noted however that while morale among businesses was strong, it had deteriorated slightly recently, adding: ""This could be related to increased uncertainty due to the situation in Greece coming to a head.""
The ministry said there were clear signs that foreign trade was recovering as German exports rose sharply in April and May.
""The revival of export activity may be an indication that global economic expansion is gaining traction,"" it said, adding that a weaker euro was another positive factor as it made German products cheaper for customers outside the currency bloc.
German tax revenues rose by 5.5 percent to 300 billion euros ($324.8 billion) in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year, the ministry said.
The German statistics office is due to publish preliminary second-quarter GDP data on August 14.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2015 02:15PM ET</span>","U.S. inflation, housing data bolster rate hike argument","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose for a fifth straight month in June as the cost of gasoline and a range of other goods increased, further signs of firming inflation that strengthen the case for an interest rate hike this year. 
Other data on Friday suggested the economy could support a tightening of monetary policy. Housing starts surged in June and building permits soared to a near eight-year high. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen this week affirmed the U.S. central bank was keen to start raising interest rates later this year. 
""The barriers to a Fed hike are starting to crumble. The wait for the first rate hike may not be that much longer,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in May. Last month's increase pushed the year-on-year CPI rate into positive territory for the first time since December.
The energy-driven disinflationary trend appears to have run its course, with producer prices rising in June for a second straight month.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking for new homes increased 9.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units in June. Permits for future home construction increased 7.4 percent to a 1.34 million-unit rate, the highest level since July 2007.
The acceleration in housing activity should ease concerns that economic growth slowed at the end of the second quarter after a surprise drop in retail sales in June and continued weakness in manufacturing.
""We are seeing strong household formation by the millennial cohort, which is putting pressure on many local housing markets,"" said Peter Ciganik, managing director at real estate investment firm GTIS Partners in New York. 
Economists anticipate that the housing market will mitigate the drag on the economy from the struggling factory sector. 
Firming price pressures, together with a tightening labor market and strengthening housing could give the Fed confidence that inflation will gradually rise toward its 2 percent target.
The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero for more than six years. Most economists believe the Fed will pull the trigger on rates in September.
The dollar rose against a basket currencies on the data, while prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower, though strong quarterly results from Google (O:GOOGL) boosted technology shares. 
SENTIMENT EBBS
While a third report showed consumer sentiment ebbed in early July on international concerns, morale remained at lofty levels, which bodes well for consumer spending. 
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 93.3 from a reading of 96.1 in June. The July reading was the eighth straight month above 90.0.
The acceleration in inflation in June was broad-based, with a steep increase in egg prices. In the 12 months through June, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in May. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, the core CPI rose 1.8 percent after May's 1.7 percent increase. An inflation measure tracked by the Fed is running well below its 2 percent target.
""Inflation doesn't have to be at their target to begin normalizing interest rates, particularly as some Fed officials are concerned that long-term inflation expectations could become dislodged if the central bank is too complacent,"" said Sohini Chowdhury, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Last month, gasoline prices increased 3.4 percent after jumping 10.4 percent in May. Food prices rose 0.3 percent, the largest increase since September 2014, as an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country caused a shortage of eggs. Egg prices surged 18.3 percent, the biggest gain since August 1973. 
Elsewhere, the index for rent increased 0.4 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. 
With the residential vacancy rate near a 22-year low as a firming labor market boosts household formation, shelter costs are likely to continue rising.

There were also increases in the cost of recreation, new motor vehicles, tobacco, airline fares and personal care. These offset declines in the prices for apparel, medical care, used cars and trucks and household furnishings.

Groundbreaking increased 9.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. 
May's starts were revised up to a 1.07 million-unit rate from the previously reported 1.04 million-unit pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts increasing to a 1.11 million-unit pace last month.
Rising household formation as a tightening labor market encourages young adults to leave parental homes is boosting demand for housing, especially apartments. 
Permits for future home construction increased 7.4 percent to a 1.34 million-unit rate, the highest level since July 2007.
Permits have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July.
A survey on Thursday showed builders' confidence held at a more than 9-1/2-year high in July, suggesting that both permits and groundbreaking have scope to rise further. Economists anticipate that the housing market will mitigate the drag on the economy from a struggling manufacturing sector. 
While groundbreaking for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of the market, slipped 0.9 percent to a 685,000 unit pace, that reflected a big drop in the Northeast. 
Single-family starts in the South, where most of the home building takes place, jumped to their highest level since March 2008.
Starts for the volatile multifamily segment surged 29.4 percent to a 489,000 unit rate. Groundbreaking for buildings
with five units or more increased to the highest level since November 1987.
Single-family building permits rose 0.9 percent.
Multi-family building permits soared 15.3 percent. Permits for buildings with five units or more increased to their highest level since January 1990.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week and confidence among homebuilders held at a more than 9-1/2-year high in July, indicating underlying momentum in the economy.
The solid labor market and firming housing sector, underscored by Thursday's reports, suggest the economy likely is strong enough to support an interest rate hike this year. Manufacturing, however, continues to struggle.
""Overall, the economy continues to move in the right direction. We look for the Federal Reserve to hike rates twice before the end of the year beginning in September,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank remained on course to tighten monetary policy ""at some point this year."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000 for the week ended July 11, the Labor Department reported. The decline reversed the prior week's rise and ended three straight weeks of increases.
Economists had forecast claims falling to 285,000 last week. While claims tend to be volatile during the summer when automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling, a Labor Department official said there was nothing unusual in the state-level data. 
Some automakers keep production running, which can throw off a model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 3,250 to 282,500 last week. 
It was the 16th straight week that the four-week moving average of claims held below 300,000, a threshold normally associated with a firming labor market.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for short-dated U.S. government debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were higher after Greece's Parliament voted to approve a new bailout program and  Citigroup  (N:C) reported its highest quarterly profit in eight years.
MANUFACTURING LAGS
The U.S. labor market is tightening - the unemployment rate has dropped 4.7 percentage points from its peak in late 2009 to the current 5.3 percent, near the range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
Thursday's jobless claims report short showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 112,000 to 2.22 million in the week ended July 4, suggesting some long-term unemployed were finding work. 
The strong labor market is helping to prop up the housing market. A separate report showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index stood at 60 this month, the highest since November 2005. 
That was unchanged from June's upwardly revised level, which was originally reported at 59. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index has not been below that level since June 2014. 
Builders this month maintained their optimism about current and future sales, though a measure on prospective buyer traffic slipped from a five-month peak. 
""This is more evidence that housing is strengthening,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. 
But manufacturing continues to lag. In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index fell to 5.7 this month from a reading of 15.2 in June. A reading above zero indicates manufacturing expansion in the region, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
Manufacturing has been slammed by a stronger dollar and lower oil prices. The dollar has eroded the profits of multinational corporations while cheaper oil has undercut oil drilling activity, reducing investment spending in the energy sector.
""It adds to the disconcerting trend seen in other manufacturing sector indicators that have been consistently pointing to a lingering stagnation in U.S. manufacturing sector activity,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
""While we believe that the dissipation of the various headwinds buffeting this sector should result in a meaningful rebound later this year, the timing of this seems farther into the horizon."" 

A gauge of new orders in the Philadelphia Fed survey fell sharply this month as did shipments. Inventories contracted and a measure of factory employment in the region was negative for the first time since January.

Indicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments remained positive, although they declined from their readings in June.
Employment was essentially flat at the reporting firms this month.
Firms reported higher prices for raw materials and other inputs in July, but prices of manufactured goods were reported as mostly steady.
The survey’s index of future activity improved slightly, however, indicating that firms expect continuing growth in the manufacturing sector over the next six months.

Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to fall by 10,000 to 285,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 19 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 4 declined to 2.215 million from 2.327 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to fall to 2.295 million.
The four-week moving average was 282,250, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week’s total of 279,250. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in June as the cost of gasoline and a range of other goods rose, indicating the recent oil-driven downward spiral in prices was abating.
Other data on Wednesday showed a rebound in industrial production last month and a pick-up in factory activity in New York state in July. The signs of stabilizing manufacturing and firming inflation came as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed remained on track to hike interest rates this year.
""Today's data support the Fed chair's message that the economy can support a rate hike,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in May. It was the second straight month of increase in producer prices and beat economists expectations for a 0.2 percent gain.
A 0.7 percent rise in goods prices accounted for nearly two-thirds of the increase in the PPI last month. 
Gasoline prices increased 4.3 percent after surging 17 percent in May. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, rose 0.2 percent in June after increasing 0.6 percent in May.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.3 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in May. 
In testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Yellen affirmed the view of a central bank prepared to gradually raise rates after keeping its short-term lending rate near zero for more than six years.
""If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate,"" Yellen said.
MANUFACTURING STABILIZING
In a second report, the Fed said industrial output rose 0.3 percent in June, the largest increase in seven months, after two straight months of decline. While manufacturing production was flat, that was because of a 3.7 percent decline in motor vehicle output. Excluding automobiles, manufacturing rose 0.3 percent.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data and Yellen's comments. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose as concerns about global growth spurred safe-haven buying, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
A plunge in crude oil prices and a resurgent dollar have subdued producer inflation and dampened overall domestic price pressures. Inflation is stabilizing as oil prices steadily rise, but the strong dollar suggests any increase will be gradual.
A report on Tuesday showed broad weakness in import prices in June, underscoring the impact of the dollar's 11.6 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
The dollar and lower oil prices have also pressured the manufacturing sector by hurting profits of multinational corporations and undercutting oil drilling activity, which has reduced investment spending in the energy sector.
That was underscored by another report from the Fed, which described manufacturing activity as ""uneven"" across the country from mid-May through June. 
In its Beige Book report, the U.S. central bank said some of its regional Fed banks continued to report decreases in oil and natural gas drilling activity and capital spending. 
There are signs, however, that the deep spending cuts in the energy sector are diminishing as oil prices rise. 
The industrial output report showed oil and gas well drilling dropped only 3.7 percent last month after falling 8.7 percent in May, and far less than the monthly average decline of 13.7 percent over the last five months.
""The U.S. oil and gas rig count looks to have stabilized around current levels, suggesting the drag from less energy capital investment in the second quarter should subside in the third quarter,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York. 
A report from the New York Fed showed its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 3.86 in July from -1.98 in June, which was its lowest level since January 2013.
A reading above zero indicates expansion. The New York Fed survey's index on future business conditions climbed to 27.04 from June's 25.84. A measure of new orders, however, contracted for a second month.

The BoC said it was lowering its overnight cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% from 0.75% in a surprise decision.
The Bank’s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker-than-expected exports of non-energy commodities and non-commodities.
Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation.
Total CPI inflation in Canada has been around 1% in recent months, reflecting year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products.
Core inflation has been close to 2%, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors.
""Additional monetary stimulus is required at this time to help return the economy to full capacity and inflation sustainably to target,"" the bank's statement read.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in June as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, raising concerns the economy was slowing again.
Tuesday's weak retail sales report, together with signs of some softening of the labor market, dampened expectations a bit for an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year, which most economists expect could come in September. 
""The underlying tone of this report suggests that the recovery is beginning to show some signs of strain. If anything it will temper, at the margin, any consideration for a September rate hike,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.3 percent last month, the weakest reading since February, after May's downwardly revised 1.0 percent increase. 
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services dipped 0.1 percent following a 0.7 percent gain in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Economists had forecast retail sales rising 0.2 percent last month after a previously reported 1.2 percent jump in May. Core retail sales had been expected to increase 0.4 percent. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading higher as stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits from JPMorgan (N:JPM) lifted sentiment.
Coming on the heels of June's disappointing employment report and sharp drop in small business confidence last month, the weak retail sales data suggests the economy might have lost some momentum at the end of the second quarter, having struggled at the start of the year.
GROWTH FORECASTS CUT
The economy contracted at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter. The soft core retail sales prompted Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lower its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.0 percent pace. 
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers cut its forecast by the same margin to a 2.6 percent rate. 
The weakness is retail sales is surprising given that savings are at multi-year highs, boosted by the windfall from last year's plunge in gasoline prices and solid job gains. Consumer confidence is also at lofty levels. 
The second-quarter growth outlook was also dimmed by another report from the Commerce Department showing retail inventories excluding automobiles rose only 0.1 percent in May.
This component, which goes into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5 percent in April. 
The backdrop of tepid consumer spending and low inflation, which was underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on import prices, complicates matters for the Fed.
Import prices dipped 0.1 percent in June after increasing 1.2 percent in May. Import prices have now declined in 11 of the last 12 months, in part reflecting the lingering effects of a strong dollar. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last Friday she expected the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy ""at some point later this year."" Yellen could offer more clues on the timing of the first interest rate increase since 2006 when she delivers her semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. 
""Strains on household budgets such as rising housing and healthcare-related costs may be crowding out purchases of retail goods. I see no compelling reason at this time for the Fed to raise interest rates in September,"" said Alan MacEachin, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
Retail sales last month were broadly weak, with receipts at auto dealerships falling 1.1 percent after rising 1.8 percent in May. Clothing stores sales dropped 1.5 percent, the largest decline since September 2014. 
Receipts at building material and garden equipment stores fell 1.3 percent and sales at furniture stores declined 1.6 percent, the biggest drop since January last year.
There were also declines in sales at online stores and at restaurants and bars. Rising gasoline prices supported sales at service stations, where receipts rose 0.8 percent. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 1.0 percent, the biggest rise since September.

Singapore economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter as sluggish global demand knocked the city-state's manufacturing sector, dimming the outlook as growth in key trade partner China continues to cool.
Gross domestic product shrank 4.6 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months on an annualised and seasonally adjusted basis, pressured by the manufacturing sector contracting 14 percent on quarter, advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed on Tuesday.
That was in sharp contrast to a revised 4.2 percent expansion clocked in the first quarter and well below the median forecast of 0.8 percent growth in a Reuters poll.
Jonathan Cavenagh, senior FX strategist for Westpac, said the poor GDP reading could stoke expectations for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to ease its exchange rate based monetary policy later this year.
Since manufacturing tends to be quite volatile, the weak GDP is not necessarily the start of a sharp downtrend in activity, he said.
""Still, with an already weak inflation backdrop, a little bit of MAS easing expectation may creep back into the market, so hard not to see USD/SGD higher on the back of this, with the 1.3700 level now a reasonable upside target,"" Cavenagh said.
The Singapore dollar slumped to a one-month low after the weak GDP data, falling to 1.3622 versus the U.S. dollar at one point, its lowest level since June 8.
The surprise economic contraction comes amid renewed worries about the global outlook, with Greece's precarious finances threatening a fragile recovery in the euro zone and the recent rout in China's stock market posing risks to already cooling growth in Asia's economic giant.
Singapore's manufacturing sector took the brunt of the downturn in the second quarter. The MTI said the contraction in the sector was largely due to a fall in output in the biomedical and transport engineering clusters.
The manufacturing sector has been under pressure in recent months, with industrial production in April and May falling more than expected from a year earlier.
The government is forecasting the trade-reliant economy to grow 2-4 percent for 2015.
""This (data) doesn’t push the (2-4 percent) growth target out of the range. It will be probably be below the midpoint of the range rather than above unless we see export-led manufacturing growth in the third quarter,"" said Wai Ho Leong, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in Singapore."

China's exports picked up unexpectedly in June but imports tumbled again, reinforcing expectations that the government may further loosen policy to lift the Chinese economy after a recent stock market rout.
However, imports slid much less than analysts had forecast, leading some to see a silver lining in the latest data.
China's June exports exceeded analyst expectations, rising 2.8 pct from a year earlier, while imports fell by 6.1 percent.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $46.54 billion for the month, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 0.2 percent, and predicted imports would fall by 15.0 percent.
China Customs said that the crisis in Greece was having ""a certain effect"" on trade, but also blamed weak external demand in general, rising labor costs and a stronger yuan for the weakness in exports.
It said enduring industrial overcapacity continued to dampen import demand.
Persistent weakness in Chinese imports, which have fallen eight straight months, suggests that domestic consumption remained tepid even though the central bank has repeatedly loosened monetary policy in the past seven months to stoke activity.
""There was quite a recovery in import growth and it looks like there's more going on than FX rate differences,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in Singapore.
""It suggests there was an improvement in domestic demand probably due to previous policy easing.""
A survey of factories earlier this month showed that China's manufacturing sector grew slightly in June, though not as much as expected.
To boost the economy, China's central bank on June 27 cut lending rates for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves, stepping up efforts to support an economy that is headed for its poorest performance in a quarter century.
But a tumble in Chinese shares in recent weeks that knocked nearly one-third of the value off key benchmark stock indices has rattled confidence, and raised worries about potential knock-on effects on the Chinese economy.
The government is due to release second-quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday and many economists expect annual growth to have dipped below 7 percent, the weakest performance since the global financial crisis."

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories increased 0.8 percent from a month earlier, more than the 0.3 percent gain forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The biggest gains were seen in petroleum products, computer equipment and drugs.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - rose 0.8 percent, suggesting inventories will provide a boost to growth in the second quarter.
The economy contracted at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter and growth got off to a slow start in the second quarter, in part because of the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
But data since then, including in job growth, suggest the economy is picking up steam.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.3 percent in May, a slowdown from their big surge in April and less than the 0.6 percent increase expected by economists. Petroleum sales increased 4.3 percent in May, down from a revised 5.9 percent rise the prior month.

At May's sales pace it would take 1.29 months to clear shelves, the same as in April.

The four-week moving average was 279,750, an increase of 4,500 from the previous week’s total of 275,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that the trade gap grew $1.2 billion to $41.9 billion. That was less than the $42.6 billion deficit expected by analysts and suggests Wall Street economists may slightly raise their forecasts for economic growth in the second quarter.
But the drop in exports in May highlights a change in the tenor of economic growth since the United States exited the 2007-2009 recession. The economy relied more on export-led industries such as manufacturing early in the recovery, but growth is increasingly coming from domestic drivers like construction and services as the economic cycle matures.
Exports fell $1.5 billion, or 0.8 percent, to $188.6 billion in May, led by a drop in overseas sales of U.S.-made capital goods. Imports fell by about $300 million, or 0.1 percent, to $230.5 billion.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose after the data, while U.S. stock index futures were unchanged. The dollar gained against a basket of currencies. 
Since the middle of last year when the Federal Reserve made clear it was planning to raise interest rates to keep the economy from eventually overheating, the dollar has strengthened, making U.S. exports less competitive. 
Since that time, Europe's economy also has been on shaky ground and the European Central Bank has eased monetary policy, causing the euro to weaken against the dollar. European policymakers are currently fighting a debt crisis in Greece that threatens to rip apart the continent's monetary union.
Exports of goods to Germany fell 6.0 percent in May from the prior month, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures. Sales fell 4.2 percent to France, 2.1 percent to Mexico and 3.0 percent to Japan. 
The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, hit by bad weather, a strong dollar, spending cuts in the energy sector and disruptions at West Coast ports.
Other economic data, including figures on hiring and consumer spending, have pointed to a rebound during the second quarter, and a firming domestic economy could encourage the Fed to raise rates later this year. 
In May, the drop in imports came as purchases from China rose 9.5 percent. That could fan further criticism from U.S. manufacturers that Chinese firms are using a cheap currency and unfair subsidies to gain market share in America.

At the same time, U.S. net imports of oil fell to $5.8 billion in May, the lowest level since 2002.

Below is the full-text statement.
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but some key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago. This trend appears largely to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Hence, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. Despite fluctuations in markets associated with the respective developments in China and Greece, long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low.
In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy has continued to grow over the past year, but at a rate somewhat below its longer-term average. The rate of unemployment, though elevated, has been little changed recently. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. With very slow growth in labour costs, inflation is forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with stronger borrowing by businesses and growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates.
The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices.
The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

Financial firm Markit said its final reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector slipped to 54.8 in June, matching the preliminary reading.
A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
Markit's May reading of new business at service companies ticked higher from the prior month and was above the preliminary reading.
The services index's employment component declined to 54.1 from the 55.5 in May, which was the highest level since June 2014.
Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, was 54.6, also matching the preliminary reading for June and down from the 56.0 in May. Last week, Markit's final read on U.S. manufacturing activity showed growth fell to its slowest pace since October 2013 in June.
""Although still signaling moderate growth in June, the manufacturing and service sector surveys indicate that the rate of economic expansion has slowed markedly since the start of the quarter, when business was boosted by a rebound from weather related weakness,"" Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.

""The loss of growth momentum seen in the surveys means GDP growth could slacken off again in the third quarter and hiring could likewise ease off.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in June and Americans left the labor force in droves, tempering expectations for a September interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm payrolls rose 223,000 last month after a downwardly revised 254,000 increase in May, with construction and government employment unchanged, and the mining sector purging more jobs.
April payrolls were also lowered, meaning 60,000 fewer jobs were created during the two months than previously reported. The unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 5.3 percent, the lowest since April 2008, but that was a sign of weakness as 432,000 people dropped out of the labor force. 
""While we've been seeing positive signs of the economy picking up moving into the second half, this report certainly isn't pushing the Fed to accelerate the liftoff timeline,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
Still, June's payrolls increase ran well above the average for the first five months and the jobless rate is near the 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent range most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
Before the report, interest rate futures were pricing in a more than 50 percent chance of a December hike, but bets shifted to early 2016. Economists still believe the Fed, which has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, will tighten monetary policy this year. 
The dollar fell marginally against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt ended higher. U.S. stocks closed little changed on festering worries over Greece's debt crisis.
From consumer spending to housing and consumer confidence, economic reports had taken a decisively strong tenor since May, prompting many forecasters to raise their second-quarter growth estimates to above a 3 percent annual pace.
CAUTION URGED
The economy contracted at a 0.2 percent rate in the January-March quarter. While the weak employment report raises the risk that growth will slow in the third quarter, economists cautioned against reading to much into the disappointing report as calendar and seasonal quirks could have influenced the data. 
The labor force participation rate fell to 62.6 percent, the lowest since October 1977, from a four-month high of 62.9 percent in May. 
""By far the biggest source of the increase in non-participants was people transitioning from employment to not in the labor force,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Far fewer transitioned from unemployed to not in the labor force."" 
Economists had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising 230,000 last month and the unemployment rate dipping to 5.4 percent. 
Average hourly earnings were unchanged as mining and manufacturing wages fell. However, manufacturing overtime touched a four-month high in June. Average hourly earnings increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through June, decelerating from 2.3 percent in May.
Anecdotal evidence and other measures of wage growth suggest paychecks are getting fatter. 
State and local governments have raised the minimum wage and surveys show entry-level wages for new college graduates are rising. In addition, Walmart (N:WMT), the nation's largest private employer, has announced wage increases twice this year.
Though construction payrolls were unchanged in June, construction spending hit a more than 6-1/2-year-high in May. Residential construction, building permits and new home sales are all at cycle highs.
""With housing showing so much forward momentum, we find it hard to accept that not a single net new person was hired in the construction industry,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.
NOT ALL BAD
There were, however, some encouraging signs in the employment report. Though the participation rate tumbled last month, other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they contemplate raising interest rates for the first time since 2006 improved significantly. 
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell to 10.5 percent, the lowest since July 2008, from 10.8 percent in May.
The number of discouraged workers in June was the lowest since October 2008. In addition, the number of long-term unemployed continued to fall, touching its lowest level since late September 2008. Americans are also experiencing shorter spells of unemployment.
Last month, factory jobs increased 4,000, adding to a 7,000 gain in May. Retail payrolls rose a solid 32,900 and temporary help, a potential harbinger of future permanent hiring, increased 19,800 jobs, the most since December. 
The mining sector, however, lost 3,000 more jobs because of layoffs in the energy industry. But the pace of declines is slowing. The sector shed 18,000 jobs in May.
Oil-field companies, including Schlumberger (N:SLB),  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) and Halliburton (N:HAL), have announced thousands of job cuts after a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2015 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders fall more than expected on transportation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell more than expected in May on weak demand for transportation and electrical equipment, a sign that
manufacturing remained mired in a soft patch.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods dropped 1.0 percent after a revised 0.7 percent decline in April. Factory orders have dropped in nine of the last 10 months.
Economists had forecast orders falling 0.5 percent in May after April's previously reported 0.4 percent drop.
Excluding the volatile transport component, orders nudged up 0.1 percent in May, reversing April's 0.1 percent decline.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which has squeezed profits of multinational corporations and oil-field firms.
There are signs, however, the sector is starting to stabilize. A report on Wednesday showed the Institute for Supply Management's national factory activity index rose to a five-month high in June. A sub-index of new orders increased for a third straight month.
In addition, the rout in the energy sector looks close to running it course as crude oil prices recover after falling nearly 60 percent from June last year to March. Energy firms pulled only three rigs from U.S. oil fields last week, the smallest number in five weeks.
The Commerce Department report showed orders for transportation equipment tumbled 6.5 percent in May. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 2.8 percent.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – fell 0.4 percent instead of the0.4 percent gain reported last month.
It was the second straight month of decline in these so-called core capital goods.

Shipments of core capital goods, used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were revised down to show a 0.1 percent dip in May instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent rise.

775,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 02, 2015 09:16AM ET</span>","US Economy Adds 223,000 Jobs In June","By Jessica Menton -

U.S. employment rose by 223,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent, the Labor Department said Thursday. The report was forecast to show employers adding 230,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was expected to tick down to 5.4 percent, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
The report comes after U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in April and May following a sharp hiring downturn in March.
Economists are seeing a favorable trend this year: high-end jobs in business and professional services continue to show growth, increasing by 64,000 in June, in line with the average monthly gain of 57,000 over the prior 12 months.
“We all know of the stories of people finishing college and ended up working for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) after the financial crisis. Now we’re finally seeing jobs for architects, engineers and computer scientists going up in the numbers,” said William Spriggs, chief economist at AFL-CIO.
This will help boost average wages because its means the economy is tipping towards adding jobs that are higher wage jobs, Spriggs said.
The U.S. had previously added at least 200,000 jobs per month for 12 consecutive months following February’s strong jobs report, a feat not seen in 20 years.
“One does presume that this is not an all you can eat jobs buffet,” said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief at Bankrate.com. “At some point the economy essentially becomes satiated but we don’t think we’re there just yet simply because of lack of wage gains.”
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month, at 2.1 million, constituting 25.8 percent of the unemployed. The average hourly earnings for private-sector workers fell by 1 cent to $24.95. For most workers, however, real wages have fallen or remained flat for more than three decades.
Meanwhile, many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full time, and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest proportion opting out of the workforce since the 1970s. The labor-force participation rate was little changed at 62.6 percent, according to the report released Friday.
The participation rate still hovers near a 30-year low because improvements in the labor market are being offset by structural headwinds coming from demographics: baby boomers are retiring and young professionals are going back to school.
The precipitous drop in oil prices over the last 12 months, economists expect to continue to see job losses related to energy, such as the oil and mining sector because as investment in those areas declines, employment in those areas will decrease too.
Employment in mining fell for the sixth month in a row. Since a recent high in December 2014, employment in mining has declined by 71,000, with losses concentrated in support activities for mining.
However, information technology continues to see strong growth across the retail, insurance and enterprise space as companies upgrade their mobile infrastructure and software applications, said Sal DiFranco, executive vice president at recruiting firm DHR International. Experts are also seeing strong growth in the device and wearable market space, as well as engineering and sales positions.
“Some of the hottest regions right now for jobs are in Texas, Boston and obviously San Francisco with the technology hubs that are located there, but also surprisingly a lot of growth in Chicago and Washington D.C.,” DiFranco said.
A robust nonfarm payrolls report could provide further evidence the U.S. economy is on strong enough footing to absorb the impact of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September. The looming question now is how the economy further reduces an unemployment rate stuck at roughly 5.5 percent since earlier in the year.
“All the signs point to more strong jobs growth,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes. “The unemployment rate may remain unchanged or even slightly tick up because there are more people coming back into the labor force, and that’s a strong sign.”
Most economists pushed back expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June as a result of March’s disappointing jobs data, coupled with a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter.
“The general view is there will be a serious discussion about raising rates in September, unless a jobs report comes in way off base from what people are expecting to see,” said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed.com.
The increases, which would be the first in nearly a decade, have not yet come and interest rates remain at historic lows since the financial crisis in 2008.

The Labor Department reported that the economy added 223,000 jobs in June, compared to expectations for jobs growth of 230,000.
May’s figure was revised down to 254,000 from 262,000 previously.
The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.3% last month, from 5.5% in June. Economists had expected the jobless rate to decline to 5.4%.
The data still indicated ongoing improvement in the labor market, which the Federal Reserve is a key factor in deciding when to start hiking interest rates.
The US dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 96.27, down from around 96.59 ahead of the report.

Research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said the U.K. construction purchasing managers' index rose to 58.1 from 55.9 in May.
Economists had expected an increase to 56.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Residential activity remained the fastest growing area of construction output in June. However, the acceleration was also driven by a sharp upturn in both commercial and civil engineering activity growth the report said.
“The extent of the recent rise in construction optimism is partly down to relief that pre-election uncertainty has now passed, but it also suggests that firms are infused with confidence that underlying demand will continue to recover” Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author the report, said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in June and factory activity picked up, providing fresh evidence the economy was gathering solid momentum after contracting at the start of the year.
The brightening growth outlook was also bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing auto sales remained strong in June and construction spending rose in May to its highest level in just over 6-1/2 years. 
The recent raft of upbeat data supports views of a September interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve, although market-based forecasting tools suggest lift-off may not occur until late in the year or even in 2016.
""The economy has shifted back into solid growth mode. A strong June jobs number would make it clear the economy can absorb a rate hike and the Fed can move at any time it wants,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ADP National Employment Report showed 237,000 private-sector jobs were created in June, beating the median expectation among economists surveyed by Reuters for a gain of 218,000 jobs. Private payrolls increased 203,000 in May.
June's gain marked the third straight month of improvement since the pace of hiring had slumped to a 14-month low back in March. Job increases last month were led by small businesses and the services sector. 
Employment in the construction industry increased 19,000 jobs, though down from the 28,000 jobs added in May. Manufacturing payrolls rose 7,000, more than recouping the 2,000 jobs lost in May.
U.S. stocks ended higher on the economic data, but gains were curbed as Greece's debt crisis showed no clear sign of resolution. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Thursday. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 230,000 in June after a robust 280,000 gain in May. The jobless rate was forecast dipping one-tenth of a percentage point back to a seven-year low of 5.4 percent.
FACTORIES HUMMING
""The U.S. job machine remains in high gear. The current robust pace of job growth is double that needed to absorb the growth in the working-age population,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its national factory activity index rose to 53.5 in June, a five-month high, from a reading of 52.8 in May. It was the second straight month of gains in the index.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. A gauge of new orders received by factories increased for a third straight month. 
Eleven out of 18 industries, including furniture, fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth in June. Four industries, including petroleum and coal products, and primary metals, reported activity contracted.
Last month's pickup in factory activity is a welcome development for the sector, which is struggling with the lingering effects of dollar strength and lower energy prices.
Factory activity could get a boost from robust automobile sales. Data on Wednesday showed strong demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks in June helped General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) offset slowing demand for sedans by allowing them to raise prices on their trucks. 
Overall auto sales slowed to a still-hefty seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.16 million units in June from May's best-in-a-decade pace of 17.80 million units, according to Autodata Corp. June sales marked the third month in the last four to run above the 17 million units mark. 
Economic reports, including employment, consumer spending, confidence and housing, have assumed a strong note in recent months, suggesting growth was gaining steam after gross domestic product fell at a 0.2 percent annual rate at the start of 2015.
The economy was hit by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector in the first quarter.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.8 percent to an annual rate of $1.04 trillion in May, the highest level since October 2008.
Gains were broad-based, but more pronounced in the private nonresidential segment. Economists said that should offset the drag on second-quarter growth from weak oil and gas drilling.
""Construction spending looks set to add significantly to second-quarter GDP growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

(Reuters) - U.S. small businesses put hiring on pause in June after five straight months of solid increases, but the outlook for the labor market remained relatively upbeat, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said its monthly survey of members found hiring was little changed last month. NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg said that sets the stage for an increase in the unemployment rate.
""Overall, June was a disappointment although not a disaster,"" Dunkelberg said.
Fifty-two percent of small business owners reported hiring or trying to hire, with 44 percent of those reporting few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.
Twenty-four percent reported job openings they could not fill, down from 29 percent in May, the NFIB said.
The share of business owners looking to increase employment dropped six points, to 16 percent, while those planning reductions was up two points, at 6 percent.
The survey was one dark spot on a day when several positive economic reports were released. It followed a report earlier on Thursday that showed U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in June, and a separate reading showing factory activity accelerated.
The ADP National Employment Report showed 237,000 jobs were created, handily exceeding the median expectation among economists surveyed by Reuters for a gain of 218,000 jobs.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Thursday.

in the economy.
Construction spending increased 0.8 percent to an annual rate of $1.04 trillion, the highest level since October 2008, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
April's outlays were revised slightly to show a 2.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 2.2 percent rise.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in May. The government revised construction spending data going back to January 2013.
The construction spending report added to robust data on employment, consumer spending, consumer confidence and housing, in suggesting that growth was gaining steam after gross domestic product shrank at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first

The economy was hit by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector at the start of the year.
In May, construction spending was lifted by a 0.9 percent increase in private construction spending to the highest level since July 2008. Outlays on private residential construction rose 0.3 percent, reflecting gains in home building and a slight increase in renovations.
Spending on private non-residential construction projects increased 1.5 percent to the highest level since December 2008.
Public construction outlays rose 0.7 percent to a seven-month high. Spending on state and local government projects - the largest portion of the public sector segment -gained 0.2 percent, also touching a seven-month high.

(Reuters) - Asia's largest economies showed hints of healing last month but euro zone factory growth remained tepid as Greek debt talks, and the country's possible departure from the bloc, dominated debate in Europe.
Speculation Athens would fail to make June 30's 1.6 billion euro repayment to the International Monetary Fund, heightening expectations Greece would crash out of the currency union, kept the bloc's manufacturing output check.
Having now defaulted on that debt and lost frozen international bailout money, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras wrote to creditors saying he was ready to accept their offer but only with revisions, according to a Greek government official.
A Reuters poll on Monday said there was a 45 percent chance that Greece would leave the euro and, although it makes up only about 2 percent of the euro zone economy, fears of contagion to other weak members overshadowed recent signs that businesses are in better shape.
Markit's final euro zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reached a 14-month high but only nudged up 52.5 last month, from May's 52.2. That was in line with a preliminary reading published before the Greek fears intensified.
Any reading above 50 indicates growth. A sub index measuring factory output that feeds into the composite PMI, due on Friday and seen as a good guide to growth, came in at 53.6, just above May's 53.3.
That PMI outstripped lackluster readings from Germany and France, the euro zone's two biggest economies, for a second month and Markit said manufacturing provided only a modest boost to the wider economy.
""It is still only consistent with fairly sluggish growth in euro zone industrial output, suggesting the beneficial effects of the euro's depreciation may already be starting to fade,"" said Jessica Hinds, European economists at Capital Economics.
""The country breakdown revealed that industry is still faring well in Spain and Italy, but with worries about Greece intensifying this may not be sustained.""
British manufacturing growth slowed unexpectedly to its weakest rate in more than two years, dented by subdued export demand from Europe. [GB/PMIM]
European shares and peripheral euro zone bonds rose and the euro held its own earlier on Wednesday as some investors kept faith with expectations that, despite defaulting, Greece would find a way to stay inside the currency zone.
Later on Wednesday in the United States, the ISM factory PMI is expected to accelerate, reinforcing views the Federal Reserve could start raising interest rates in September.
ASIAN TIGERS PURRING
Growth in China's services sector picked up in June while big Japanese companies planned to ramp up spending at the fastest pace in a decade, offering hope that prospects are improving for Asia's largest economies, despite sluggish factory growth.
Activity in China's factory sector expanded slightly in June though not as much as expected, official surveys showed, suggesting the economy may be starting to slowly level out after a raft of support measures.
China's official manufacturing PMI for June came in at 50.2, unchanged from May, while the services PMI climbed to 53.8 from 53.2.
Japanese factory business barely expanded but a private report showed a strong pick-up in export orders, while a Bank of Japan survey showed a strong bounce in business confidence and spending plans.
That will be a welcome sign for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic revival strategy which has had limited success in nudging firms to boost wages and investment.
""When you have two of the biggest economies in the world showing positive readings, that is encouraging. They also come on the back of some good readings out of the U.S.,"" said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec in Sydney.
Analysts at ANZ, though, suspect softness in the manufacturing sector would require more policy easing.
""Looking ahead, as real interest rates faced by Chinese companies remain elevated, we see that further monetary easing is still highly needed,"" said Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao at ANZ.
On Saturday, China's central bank cut lending rates for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves. The action was the first since the height of the global financial crisis in late 2008.
In South Korea, exports fell and factory activity shrank. An outbreak of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has prompted some analysts to trim economic growth forecasts and pushed the government to announce a $13 billion fiscal stimulus package.

Reports from India, Taiwan and Indonesia also pointed to challenging conditions for many economies in the region.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Although domestic market conditions held up relatively well in June, leading to higher inflows of new business, companies reported that new export orders fell on the back of subdued demand from Europe, partly due to the sterling exchange rate.
“The UK manufacturing sector had a disappointing second quarter overall. Growth trends in output and new orders were the weakest since the opening quarter of 2013, as a strong sterling exchange rate and subdued demand from mainland Europe offset the continued solidity of the domestic market,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector picked up in June while big Japanese companies planned to ramp up spending at the fastest pace in a decade, offering hope that prospects are improving for Asia's largest economies despite sluggish factory growth.
Wednesday's data fueled expectations that the wobbly global economy may start leveling out in the second half of the year, but the outlook remains murky, with fears that Greece's debt crisis could splinter the euro zone and worries about whether China can avoid a stock market crash keeping investors on edge.
Activity in China's factory sector expanded slightly in June though not as much as expected, official surveys showed, suggesting the economy may be starting to slowly level out after a raft of support measures including interest rate cuts and more infrastructure spending.
Japanese factories barely expanded but a private report showed a strong pick-up in export orders, while a Bank of Japan survey showed a strong bounce in business confidence and spending plans, a welcome sign for premier Shinzo Abe's economic revival strategy which has seen limited success in nudging firms to boost wages and investment.
""When you have two of the biggest economies in the world showing positive readings, that is encouraging. They also come on the back of some good readings out of the United States,"" said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec in Sydney.
Yet reports from South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia provided a more sobering read that still pointed to challenging conditions for many economies in the region.
The unending uncertainty over Greece also dampened confidence, though Asian markets held up well on Wednesday.
Similar activity surveys are due from Europe and the United States later in the day.
Though Greece makes up only about 2 percent of the euro zone economy, fears of contagion to other weak EU members could overshadow recent signs that businesses are in better shape.
In the U.S., the ISM factory PMI is expected to accelerate, reinforcing views the Federal Reserve could start raising interest rates in September, though a healthier U.S. economy is not giving as big a boost to Asia's exports as in the past. 
H2 BOUNCE OR DEJU VU ALL OVER AGAIN?
To be sure, Asian exporters and global policymakers have made the same bad calls over and over again in past years, betting that advanced economies will recover strongly, but sustained turnarounds have repeatedly proved elusive.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for June came in at 50.2, unchanged from May, while the services PMI climbed to 53.8 from 53.2 in May, above the 50 level that is supposed to separate growth from contraction.
""It basically highlights there is some degree of stabilization happening and it's very much in line with what the authorities want to see,"" CommSec's James added.
Analysts at ANZ, though, suspect softness in the manufacturing sector would require more policy easing.
""Looking ahead, as real interest rates faced by Chinese companies remain elevated, we see that further monetary easing is still highly needed,"" Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao at ANZ wrote in a research note.
On Saturday, China's central bank cut lending rates for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves. The dual central bank action was the first since the height of the global financial crisis in late 2008.
In contrast, conditions in export-reliant South Korea continued to deteriorate, with exports falling for a sixth straight month in June and manufacturing activity shrinking at the fastest pace in nearly three years.
Adding to the country's woeful performance is the outbreak of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome since late May, which has prompted some analysts to trim their economic growth forecast for the year and pushed the government to announce a $13 billion fiscal stimulus package last week. 
Analysts at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) were more upbeat.
""We see some silver linings that could pave the way for Korean exports to stabilize in Q3,"" they wrote in a note to clients, citing a strong rise in U.S. consumer confidence and signs that its shipments to China appeared to be bottoming.
Much might depend on whether China tames its volatile share market, which has plunged 20 percent from its peaks in early June, and whether its housing market can take a stronger turn in the second half of the year.

While home sales and prices have picked up in the biggest Chinese cities, investment remains weak with high local government debt levels and bureaucratic delays thwarting Beijing's efforts to get big infrastructure projects off the ground.

Beijing has rolled out a flurry of steps since last year, including interest rate cuts and more infrastructure spending, but analysts remain wary about the outlook given the still-weak property market, erratic global demand for China's exports and fears of a collapse in its wild stock market.

""Looking ahead, as real interest rates faced by Chinese companies remain elevated, we see that further monetary easing is still highly needed"".
With demand weak at home and abroad, factory growth remained tepid, with the reading just above the 50 point level that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.2 in June, unchanged from the previous month's reading, the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted it would edge up to 50.3.
""Business development momentum is still insufficient, and domestic and foreign demand remains weak"", the bureau said.
The sub-index for new orders - a proxy for domestic and foreign demand - fell to 50.1 in June from May's 50.6. New export orders fell to 48.2 from 48.9 in May, indicating contraction in foreign demand for a ninth straight month.
And stressed factories continued to shed jobs, with the employment sub-index inching down to 48.1 from May's 48.2.
A private factory survey also released on Wednesday showed activity contracted for the fourth straight month in June but at a slower pace than in May. The official survey focuses on larger, state-owned firms, and the private one on small and mid-sized companies which are facing tougher financial and operating conditions.
The central bank cut lending rates on Saturday for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves, stepping up efforts to support the slowing economy.
ANZ expected the central bank to further cut interest rates by another 25 basis points (bps) in the third quarter, and cut banks' reserve requirement by an additional 100bps in the second half.
SERVICES SHINES
Meanwhile, the official services PMI rose to 53.8 from May's 53.2, the bureau said, suggesting growth in that sector quickened slightly in June, offsetting some of the broader economic drag from ailing factories.
The new orders sub-index of the services PMI rose to 51.3 in June from 49.5 in May and the employment sub-index inched up to 49.7 from May's 47.6 as the pace of job shedding eased.
The services sector has accounted for the bigger part of China's economic output for at least two years, with its share rising to 48.2 percent last year, compared with the 42.6 percent contribution from manufacturing and construction.
""The services sector is also cooling, except the financial sector that has been supported by the stock market"", said Lin Hu, an economist at Guosen Securities in Beijing.
Lin believed rising trading volume in the stock market may have lent more support to the economy in the second quarter, though some analysts fear that a further stock plunge may hit consumer confidence and spending and put added strain on the financial system. Weighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and high levels of local debt, China's economic growth in 2015 is seen slowing to around 7 percent - the weakest annual expansion in a quarter of a century.

Property prices and sales have also shown signs of improving in recent months, at least in big cities, but investment remains weak with high local government debt levels and bureaucratic delays thwarting Beijing's efforts to get big infrastructure projects off the ground.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence increased solidly in June, with households upbeat about the labor market, supporting views the economy was back on firmer footing after wobbling at the start of the year.
The rise in confidence came despite moderate increases in gasoline prices. Other data on Tuesday showed house prices rising in April from a year ago and factory activity in the Midwest stabilizing after hitting a 5-1/2-year low in February. 
""Consumer spirits are soaring right now showing the economy is on track for further gains this year,"" said Chris Rupkey,
chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes rose to a reading of 101.4 this month from 94.6 in May. The survey showed households growing more bullish about the jobs market. The share of people saying jobs are hard-to-get fell to 25.7 percent from 27.2 percent in May.
The ranks of those viewing jobs as ""plentiful"" increased to 21.4 percent in June from 20.6 percent the prior month. This supports views of tightening labor market conditions.
The upbeat confidence report was the latest indication that growth was gaining momentum after gross domestic product shrank at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, as the economy battled bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
The report joined bullish data on employment, consumer spending and housing. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors braced for a default by Greece on a repayment to the International Monetary Fund. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher, and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices for 30-year U.S. government debt rose. 
HOUSE PRICE APPRECIATION SLOWING
A second report showed single-family home prices rose in April, but the pace of appreciation appears be slowing, which could ease concerns that rising home values will reduce affordability for first-time buyers.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas in April rose 4.9 percent in April from a year ago. The year-on-year pace of appreciation slowed a bit from 5.0 percent in March.
Denver and San Francisco posted the strongest year-over-year gains, with prices in Denver up 10.3 percent and prices in San Francisco rising 10 percent. Price rises slowed in 11 cities.
""The housing market has essentially recovered. In those areas where home prices moved too far out of line with underlying regional economic fundamentals, the price recovery is likely to continue to fall short,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. 
""On a national scale, a more sane allocation of mortgage credit and growth in income and employment are combining to deliver existing home price appreciation generally in line with how much more income consumers have to spend.""
The housing market is being bolstered by a tightening labor market, which is helping to spur some pick-up in wage growth.
Manufacturing, which is struggling with the lingering effects of dollar strength and lower energy prices, is starting to stabilize, but it will take a while for activity to pick up.
In a separate report, the Chicago Institute for Supply Management said its Chicago Business Barometer index increased 3.2 points to 49.4 in June, recovering half of May's decline. The index, however, stayed in contraction territory for a second straight month. 
Though new orders rose a solid 8.8 percent, pulling back into expansion territory this month, order books continued to shrink. Production contracted further in June, but at a slower pace, and inventories continued to fall.

""With lingering themes of a strong U.S. dollar and tepid demand both at home and overseas, production is likely to remain restrained for some time,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose to their highest level in just over nine years in May, in a further boost to the housing market and the broader economic outlook.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 0.9 percent to 112.6, the highest level since April
2006. Contracts have now increased for five straight months. 
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase pointed to further gains in home resales after they hit a 5-1/2-year high in May. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 1.2 percent last month.
""The recent trend suggests that we will see continued strength in resales in the months ahead. However the current low inventory levels, which are placing upward pressure on home prices, remain a downside risk,"" said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) in New York.
The housing market recovery is back on track after being slammed by bad weather at the start of the year. It is being bolstered by a tightening labor market, which is helping to spur some pick-up in wage growth.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report, with investors warily watching developments in Greece as Athens moved closer to a defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks fell at the open, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt were higher. 
The pending home sales report added to robust building permits, housing starts, new home sales and home resales data in painting a bullish picture of the housing market. 
It also joined strong retail sales, consumer sentiment and employment data in suggesting a building up of momentum in the economy after a mild contraction in output in the first quarter.
Pending home sales increased 10.4 percent from a year ago.
Contracts increased 6.3 percent in the Northeast and rose 2.2 percent in the West. They slipped 0.8 percent in the South and dipped 0.6 percent in the Midwest.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest increase in nearly six years in May on strong demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items, further evidence that economic growth was accelerating in the second quarter. 
While other data on Thursday showed a modest increase in first-time applications for unemployment benefits last week, the underlying trend in jobless claims continued to suggest the labor market was tightening.
The strengthening economy suggests the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year even as inflation remains well below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. Many economists expect a rate hike in September.
""This portends well for second-quarter growth and the broader momentum of economic activity in the second half of the year, and keeps the prospect of a September rate hike squarely on the table,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.9 percent last month, the biggest gain since August 2009, after a 0.1 percent rise in April. 
May's sturdy increase in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, suggested households were finally spending some of the windfall from lower gasoline prices, and capped a month of solid economic reports.
It was the latest indication that growth was gaining momentum after gross domestic product shrank at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, as the economy battled bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
From employment to the housing market, the economic data for May has been bullish. Even manufacturing, which is struggling with the lingering effects of dollar strength and lower energy prices, is starting to stabilize. 
Though a report on Thursday showed some cooling in services sector activity in June, businesses continued to view economic conditions as improving.
Economists had forecast consumer spending rising 0.7 percent last month.
U.S. stocks traded higher, with healthcare shares enjoying a broad rally after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding tax subsidies crucial to President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law.
Prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
Last month, spending on long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles jumped 2.2 percent and outlays on services like utilities rose 0.3 percent.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.6 percent, the largest jump since last August, after being unchanged in April. 
The rise in real consumer spending prompted economists at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) to bump up their second-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 3.1 percent annual rate.
Personal income increased 0.5 percent in May after a similar gain in the prior month. Income is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is starting to push up wage growth.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended June 20.
But it was the 16th straight week that claims had held below 300,000, a threshold usually associated with a firming labor market. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell last week.
The strengthening jobs market could be bolstering confidence in the economy, encouraging households to tap into savings that have been boosted by lower gasoline prices.
The saving rate fell to 5.1 percent last month from 5.4 percent in April. Still, savings remain at lofty levels. That, together with rising wages, suggests more fuel for consumer spending for the rest of the year.
""The labor market is tight, wages and incomes are rising solidly, so we should expect consumers to help lead the economy forward,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Despite the acceleration in consumer spending, inflation pressures remained tame last month. A price index for consumer spending increased 0.3 percent after being flat in April. 
In the 12 months through May, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose only 0.2 percent.

Excluding food and energy, prices edged up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in April. The so-called core PCE price index rose 1.2 percent in the 12 months through May, the smallest gain since February 2014.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Small-business investment increased in most parts of Canada in the first quarter, with the exception of two of the country's most oil-sensitive provinces, as firms adjusted to the fallout of lower crude prices, data from PayNet showed on Thursday.
PayNet, which tracks commercial financing for millions of small and medium-sized businesses in North America, said a shift in the economy is underway, as regions less reliant on oil production make a greater contribution to growth. It estimates it will take another one to two years for this shift to play out.
The regional breakdown, which was prepared exclusively for Reuters, showed that Alberta and Saskatchewan together were the only part of Canada to see a decrease, with investment falling by an average 1 percent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year.
In Ontario, Canada's most populous province and its manufacturing heartland, investment rose 1 percent. In British Columbia and Manitoba investment rose 4 percent, while Quebec saw an increase of 2 percent. In the Maritime provinces investment rose 3 percent.
Lending nationally increased by 1 percent in the quarter, according to previously released PayNet data.
""It's going to take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to fully reshuffle the economy from energy to manufacturing and the consumer,"" Bill Phelan, president of PayNet, said.
Barring any unexpected global developments, ""this will actually make the Canadian economy more resilient, less concentrated on the commodity sector and probably better positioned for longer sustainable growth,"" Phelan added.
Canada's economy contracted at its steepest pace in nearly six years in the first quarter but economists are looking for growth to pick up later in the year.
The PayNet data also suggested some of the benefits of lower oil are taking hold, such as providing consumers and manufacturers with more money to spend. Investment at retail companies increased 68 percent in the first quarter, while manufacturers raised investment by 8 percent, Phelan said.
Companies, however, have not escaped the oil downturn completely unscathed, as delinquency rates rose across the country. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the amount of loans that were more than 30 days past due rose to 2 percent as of March compared with 1.8 percent at the end of 2014. That was exceeded only by Quebec, where delinquencies climbed to 3.1 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter but less than previously estimated as it struggled with bad weather, a strong dollar, spending cuts in the energy sector and disruptions at West Coast ports. 
Growth, however, has since rebounded in the second quarter as the temporary drag from unusually heavy snowfalls and the ports dispute faded. Retailers reported strong sales in May and employers stepped up hiring. Housing is also strengthening and manufacturing activity is beginning to stabilize. 
A steadily firming economy could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday gross domestic product shrank at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter instead of the 0.7 percent pace of contraction it reported last month.
A fairly stronger pace of consumer spending and inventory accumulation than previously estimated accounted for the upward revision to GDP. Business investment spending was less weak than the government had estimated last month.
""These revisions have a marginally positive impact on our view of the second quarter. Demand is still solid, but the adjustment to the strong dollar has not run its course,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, was raised to a 2.1 percent growth pace from the 1.8 percent rate reported in May.
With more Americans getting a paycheck and a tightening labor market finally spurring stronger wage growth, consumer spending could accelerate in the second quarter. 
Spending could also get a boost from rising household wealth as home prices accelerate. Personal savings increased at a robust $720.2 billion pace in the first quarter. 
Though export growth was revised higher, that was offset by an upward revision to imports, leaving a still-large trade deficit that subtracted almost 2 percentage points from GDP.
U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower as debt negotiations between Greece and its foreign creditors hit a snag. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt rose.
UNDERLYING STRENGTH
The economy was initially reported to have grown at a 0.2 percent rate at the start of the year. It expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Growth estimates for the second quarter are currently between a 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent rate. 
But the first-quarter slump in output likely is not a true reflection of the economy's health. Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, say a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations also contributed to depressing the GDP number.
The government said last month it was aware of the potential problem and was working to address it when it publishes annual GDP revisions in July.
""We do not believe that economic activity stalled in the first quarter. Other data on labor markets ... are more consistent with a modest pace of economic activity,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York. 
Over the past year, GDP expanded 2.9 percent. When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.9 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 1.4 percent pace. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2 percent rate. 
Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February sliced off at least one percentage point from growth. 
Dollar strength and lower energy prices have been a drag on business spending and factories, with manufacturing production also undercut by the ports labor dispute.
Businesses accumulated $4.5 billion more in inventory than previously estimated in the first quarter, which could mean they have little incentive to keep on adding to stock in the current quarter. Inventories contributed 0.45 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.33 percentage point. 
Inventories could be a drag on second-quarter GDP.

The buoyant dollar also weighed on after-tax corporate profits, which were a bit weaker in the first quarter than previously thought. Profits after tax were revised to show a 8.8 percent drop instead of the 8.7 percent fall reported in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment spending plans rose in May, a tentative sign that the manufacturing sector was stabilizing after hitting a soft patch in recent months.
But the lingering effects of lower oil prices and a strong dollar will continue to constrain factory activity for a while, economists say. Other data on Tuesday showed new home sales increased to a more than seven-year high in May. 
Manufacturing is lagging an overall rebound in the economy after output shrank at the start of the year. Despite the weakness in factory activity, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this year.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4 percent last month. These so-called core capital goods orders slipped 0.3 percent in April.
""We are still far from calling the all-clear for the manufacturing sector's recent soft patch. That said, today's increase in core orders offers some modest encouragement,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the economy was likely to strengthen in the second half of the year and could be ready for a rate hike in September and a second increase in December.
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on Powell's comments, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. Prices for U.S. government debt fell also as safe-haven bids faded on hopes of a deal that could prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hurt by the strong dollar and investment spending cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year. 
The number of U.S. oil drilling rigs has dropped to near five-year lows, prompting oilfield companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) to slash their capital expenditure budgets for this year. 
However, the pace of the decline in oil rig counts has slowed in recent weeks as crude prices edged higher. The dollar has gained about 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, taking a bite out of the profits of multinational corporations. 
Factories also have been hampered by businesses placing fewer orders while working through a stockpile of goods accumulated last year.
HOUSING SIZZLES
In a second report, the Commerce Department said new home sales rose 2.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000 units in May, the highest level since February 2008. April's sales pace was revised sharply higher.
The report came on the heels of data on Monday showing home resales in May surged to a 5-1/2-year high. Data last week also showed building permits near an eight-year peak in May, while homebuilders were the most optimistic in nine months in June.
Housing is being buoyed by a strengthening jobs market, which is boosting household formation, and steps by the government to ease lending conditions for first-time buyers.
""This bodes well for consumption down the road with home buyers expected to stock their new abodes with appliances, carpeting and furniture,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
""This is just the kick-start the economy needs to continue to grow in the second half of the year."" 
The bullish new home sales report added to strong retail sales, consumer sentiment and employment data in suggesting the economy was gaining speed in the second quarter after gross domestic product contracted in the first three months of 2015.
Though manufacturing may be regaining its footing, a quick turnaround is probably unlikely. Overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - fell 1.8 percent in May as transportation equipment orders dropped 6.4 percent.
Durable goods orders have been weak since last August.
There was a 35.3 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders in May. Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website it had received 11 aircraft orders last month, a drop from 37 in April. Unfilled orders for durable goods fell 0.5 percent in May. Order books have declined in five of the last six months. 
Durable goods inventories dropped last month after 23 straight monthly increases, suggesting restocking could be a drag on second-quarter growth. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its second-quarter GDP forecast by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.9 percent annual rate.

A third report from financial data firm Markit showing factory activity slowing to a more than 1-1/2-year low in early June also offered a cautionary note on manufacturing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment spending plans rose in May in a tentative sign of stabilization in the manufacturing sector, which has been weak since the late summer of 2014.
But the lingering effects of lower oil prices and a strong dollar will continue to constrain factory activity for a while, economists say. Other data on Tuesday showed new home sales increased to a more than seven-year high in May. 
Manufacturing is lagging an overall rebound in the economy after output slumped at the start of the year. Despite the weakness in factory activity, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this year.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4 percent last month. These so-called core capital goods orders slipped 0.3 percent in April.
""These are encouraging signs ... we need to see further gains over the next couple of months before we can more firmly conclude that manufacturing orders are rebounding,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Last month, shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement, rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in April.
A 6.4 percent drop in transportation equipment, however, weighed down overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which fell 1.8 percent last month.
That was because of a 35.3 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders. Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website that it had received 11 aircraft orders last month, a drop from 37 in April. It was the second straight monthly decline in transportation orders. 
The weakness in manufacturing is likely far from over, with order books continuing to shrink last month. Unfilled orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell 0.5 percent in May. They have declined in five of the last six months. 
Inventories of these goods dropped in May after 23 straight months of increases, suggesting restocking could be a drag on second-quarter growth. 

In a third report, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a reading of 53.4 in June, the lowest since October 2013, from 54 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity.

Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 53.4 in June, it lowest since October 2013, from a final May reading of 54. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the June figure would be 54.2.

The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.9 in June from a final 50.9 in May.
The index slid below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time in a month.
The output index fell to a preliminary 50.5 in June, following 51.9 in the previous month.
New orders fell to a preliminary 49.4 from 50.9 in May, also indicating the first decline in a month.
But new export orders rose to 53.6 from a final 50.6 in the previous month. That marked the fastest expansion in four months, suggesting overseas demand is starting to gather strength.
The final Markit/JMMA PMI for June is due on July 1.
The decline in the overall PMI index and the output index would be in line with economists' expectations that GDP growth slowed sharply in the second quarter.
Japan's economy is expected to have expanded an annualized 1.3 percent in April-June, much less than 3.9 percent annualized growth in the previous quarter, as companies trimmed output to focus on lowering inventories.

Many economists say this slowdown should be temporary as consumer spending, exports and capital expenditure are showing signs of driving future growth. Yet, they still expect the Bank of Japan will ease policy again later this year to spur activity further and push inflation to its 2 percent target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales surged to a 5-1/2-year high in May as first-time buyers stepped into the market, the latest indication that housing and overall economic activity were gathering steam in the second quarter.
The strengthening economic outlook likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates later this year.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales increased 5.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.35 million units, the highest level since November 2009. That put 
sales this year on track for their strongest gain since 2007. 
""It suggests that the U.S. housing market recovery is back on track after the missteps earlier this year. We expect this upbeat tone in the housing recovery to continue as the favorable domestic fundamentals begin to reassert themselves,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Tightening labor market conditions are starting to spur stronger wage growth, boosting demand for housing.
Last month's increase reversed April's surprise drop in purchases, which economists had dismissed as a blip given that forward-looking indicators on home sales, including mortgage applications, had been fairly strong during that period.
The Realtors group revised April's sales pace up to 5.09 million units from the previously reported 5.04 million units. Economists had forecast home resales rising to a 5.26 million-unit pace last month.
First-time buyers accounted for 32 percent of transactions, the largest share since September 2012. Still, the share remains well below the 40 percent to 45 percent that economists and realtors say is required for a robust housing market.
May's sturdy home sales report added to last week's data on building permits in portraying an upbeat picture of the housing market. It joined strong retail sales, consumer sentiment and employment data in suggesting a building up of momentum in the economy after output contracted at the start of the year.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on the housing data. Market sentiment was also buoyed by hopes of a deal to avert a debt default by Greece. The housing index (HGX) was up 0.63 percent, with shares in D.R. Horton (N:DHI) the largest U.S. homebuilder, rising 1.5 percent.
The dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt fell sharply.
EASING CREDIT CONDITIONS
The share of first-time buyers was up from 27 percent a year ago and the latest increase reflects moves by the government to ease lending conditions for this demographic through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies it controls.
""These programs should boost sales activity through the summer,"" said Stephanie Karol, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Away from first-time buyers, young adults setting up homes are also giving housing a steady pulse after a lackluster performance over the last few years. 
Economists hope that housing will take up some of the slack from manufacturing, which is being stymied by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector, and support the economy this year.
While the stock of homes for sales is improving, supply remains fairly tight. This means builders such as D.R. Horton and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) will need to ramp up construction to meet demand.
Last month, unsold homes on the market increased 3.2 percent from April to 2.29 million units. Supply was up only 1.8 percent from a year ago. At May's sales pace, it would take 5.1 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.2 months in April.
A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. With supply well below what it was during the housing bubble in 2006, the median price for a previously owned home increased 7.9 percent from a year ago to $228,700. 
House prices this year could exceed the peak set in 2006, the Realtors group said.
""Households not in the market will be priced out soon unless price appreciation slows to a rate that would allow more buyers to enter the market,"" said Alan MacEachin, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
On the flip side, rising house prices are increasing equity for homeowners, encouraging some to list their houses. Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has been forcing potential sellers to stay longer in their homes.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2015 01:36PM ET</span>",Gasoline lifts U.S. consumer prices; economy picks up speed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices in May recorded their largest increase in more than two years as gasoline prices surged, suggesting the impact of lower oil prices on inflation probably was fading.
Other data on Thursday showed the economy was gaining speed after stumbling in the first quarter. New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a near 15-year low and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a six-month high in June.
Price stability and a strengthening economy, highlighted by a tightening labor market, likely will push the Federal Reserve a step closer to raising interest rates later this year.
In its latest policy statement, the U.S. central bank on Wednesday said the economy was growing moderately and expressed confidence inflation would gradually move toward its 2 percent target.
Still, rate hikes will likely be gradual as a strong dollar continues to dampen underlying price pressures. The Fed has kept its key short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008.
""We think inflation will grind higher over the summer and open the door to a September rate hike. At the same time, low underlying inflation pressures mean the tightening cycle will only be gradual,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (LONDON:STAN) Bank in New York.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in April, the Labor Department said. That was the largest increase since February 2013, and left the CPI unchanged in the 12 months through May after a 0.2 percent yearly decline in April.
While energy prices are stabilizing, a strong dollar is weighing on underlying inflation pressures. The so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent, the smallest increase in five months, after a 0.3 percent jump in April. 
In the 12 months through May, the core CPI rose 1.7 percent, slowing from a yearly increase of 1.8 percent in April.
The Fed monitors a different inflation measure that is trending even lower than the CPI. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stock indexes were trading higher. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended June 13. It was the 15th straight week that claims held below 300,000, a threshold usually associated with a firming labor market.
HEALTHY JOBS MARKET
The claims data covered the period in which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of June's employment report. Jobless claims fell 8,000 between the May and June survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job gains. 
""The labor market appears to be in good health through the June payroll survey period. This ongoing labor market resilience is important, because it underpins our forecast of a rebound in the economy during the remainder of 2015,"" said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Growth prospects were further boosted by a third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showing its business activity index jumped to a reading of 15.2 in June, the highest level since December, from 6.7 in May.
A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's factories. Measures of new orders and shipments also rose to their highest levels since November. 
While manufacturers reported a rise in the cost of inputs, they were also increasing prices for their goods, a trend that supports the view that inflation will creep higher in the months ahead. 
The economy's firming tone was underscored by yet another report from the Conference Board showing its Leading Economic Index rose 0.7 percent last month after a similar gain in April. 
""Both reports provided some support to the current underlying narrative that the positive momentum in domestic economic activity is being sustained,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
A 10.4 percent jump in gasoline prices in May accounted for most of the increase in the CPI. It was the biggest increase since June 2009, and followed a 1.7 percent decline in April. 
While food prices were unchanged for a second straight month, an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country that has led to a shortage of eggs could push up prices. 
Rents increased 0.3 percent last month. With the residential vacancy rate near a 22-year low as a firming labor market boosts household formation, shelter costs are likely to continue rising. That, together with expectations that a tighter labor market will spur stronger wage growth, is expected to limit the dollar's drag on core inflation.

There were increases in the cost of medical care, new motor vehicles, airline fares, tobacco and alcoholic beverages last month. But prices for apparel, used cars and trucks, and household furnishings fell.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 9.9 percent to $113.3 billion. That was the largest shortfall since the second quarter of 2012.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit rising to $117.0 billion. The government revised data going back to the first quarter of 1999.
The first-quarter current account deficit represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, the highest since the third quarter of 2012, from 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
Still, the deficit remained well below a record high of 6.3 percent touched in the fourth quarter of 2005 as strong domestic energy production keeps the import bill in check.
The robust dollar has hurt the profits of multinational corporations and is also constraining export growth. The dollar gained about 4.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in the first quarter.
Multinationals like  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), household products maker Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.

In the first quarter, direct investment income receipts from abroad fell $9.1 billion to $109.5 billion. Exports of goods fell 6.5 percent to $382.7 billion. That was the lowest level since the third quarter of 2011, likely reflecting the impact of labor disruptions at the West Coast ports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank repossessions rose again last month, driving overall U.S. foreclosure activity to a 19-month high on an annual basis, industry firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday.
A total of 126,868 homes across the country were at some point in the foreclosure process in May, up 1 percent from April and up 16 percent from the same time last year, RealtyTrac said. 
Foreclosure activity includes foreclosure notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions.
Lenders reclaimed a total of 44,892 homes in May, down 1 percent from April but up 58 percent from a year ago. May was the third straight month of annual increases in bank repossessions, which remained far below the peak in September 2013 when lenders reclaimed 102,134 properties.
Foreclosure starts were down 1 percent in May, but rose 4 percent from the same period last year, RealtyTrac said. Lenders started the foreclosure process on 51,414 properties last month.
""May foreclosure numbers are a classic good news-bad news scenario, with the number of homeowners starting the foreclosure process stabilizing at pre-housing crisis levels but the number of homeowners actually losing their homes to foreclosure still well above pre-crisis levels and on the rise,"" said Daren Blomquist, RealtyTrac vice president.
""Lenders and courts are pushing through stubborn foreclosure cases that have been languishing in foreclosure limbo for years as options to prevent foreclosure are exhausted or left untapped.""
A total of 49,413 properties were scheduled for auction in May, up 6 percent from the prior month, up 5 percent from May 2014.

Florida continued to post the highest foreclosure rates last month, followed by New Jersey, Maryland, Nevada and Ohio, RealtyTrac said.

Policymakers have repeatedly singled out housing as one of the weak spots in the economy. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates later this year. It has kept its short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008.
""Residential construction has been the laggard in this recovery and the moon shot surge in new permits today means the final piece of the recovery puzzle is now falling into place,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Building permits jumped 11.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.28 million units, the highest since August 2007, the Commerce Department said. It was the second straight month of increase. Permits have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July.
Groundbreaking dropped 11.1 percent to a 1.04 million-unit rate. Though that partially reversed the prior month's large gain, April starts were revised up to a 1.17 million-unit rate, the highest since November 2007.
Economists had forecast both building permits and housing starts falling to a 1.10 million-unit pace last month. April starts were previously reported to have increased to a 1.14 million-unit rate.
The Commerce Department report came on the heels of solid data on retail sales, consumer confidence and employment that have suggested the economy was rebounding from the first-quarter's soft patch, when gross domestic product contracted.
Growth estimates for the second quarter are currently as high as a 3.3 percent annual rate.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher on safe-haven bids amid worries Greece could default on its debt. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher after a two-day losing streak. But the S&P homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> fell 0.28 percent. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, slipped 0.22 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, fell 0.48 percent.
BUILDERS UPBEAT
Home building has regained ground lost during a harsh winter and there are signs activity will accelerate this year as tightening labor market conditions spur stronger wage gains and encourage young adults to move from their parents' basements.
A survey on Monday showed confidence among builders vaulting to a nine-month high in June, with measures of both current sales and buyer traffic increasing solidly.
Economists anticipate that the housing market will strengthen enough to take up some of the slack from the struggling manufacturing sector and support economic growth.
""With the trade deficit no longer widening, business investment improving and households buying vehicles like crazy, the GDP number could come in a lot better than most expect,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""Investors need to recognize that while a rate hike tomorrow looks to be off the table, the economy is already strong enough to support one at any meeting in the future.""
Single-family building permits, which account for the largest share of the market, increased 2.6 percent to their highest level since December. Building permits for the volatile multifamily segment soared 24.9 percent. 
Permits for buildings with five units or more increased to their highest level since January 1990. The multifamily sector is being driven by demand for rental accommodation as more people move away from homeownership.
Permits in the Northeast vaulted to their highest level since March 1987 and were at a near one-year high in the Midwest. They fell, however, in the South and West.
Groundbreaking for single-family homes dropped 5.4 percent to a 680,000 unit pace. Multifamily starts tumbled 20.2 percent to a 356,000 unit rate.

Groundbreaking fell in all four regions, declining a steep 26.5 percent in the Northeast after April's spectacular gains. Starts in the South, where most of the home building takes place, dropped 5.0 percent.

945,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 16, 2015 07:15AM ET</span>",UK Inflation Turns Positive In May After 1-Month Dip Below Zero,"By Reuters -

British inflation turned positive again in May after dipping below zero in April for the first time in 55 years, suggesting the country's flirtation with deflation was only brief.
The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in the 12 months to May, recovering from a fall of 0.1 percent in April.
The May figure was in line with the median forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
In monthly terms, inflation rose 0.2 percent, the ONS said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has previously said inflation is likely to pick up as last year's plunge in global oil prices works itself out of the numbers, and that Britain was not heading into a damaging period of deflation.
Indeed, the BoE expects near-zero inflation to help the British economy by boosting the spending power of households.
The wages of workers in Britain have picked up in recent months. Figures due on Wednesday are expected to show basic earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.5 percent in the three months to April.
The recent rise of sterling against a basket of currencies may limit the pace of price rises in coming months.
The ONS said on Tuesday that upward pressure on prices in May came from a bounce-back in air fares which dragged down inflation in April on the different timing of the Easter holidays in 2015 and 2014.
Fuel prices rose 1.9 percent in May from April, reflecting a recovery in global oil prices.
Food prices also rose in monthly terms, up 0.1 percent from April for their first month-on-month rise since December.
An underlying measure of inflation, which strips out increases in energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose by a yearly 0.9 percent in May, picking up slightly from April.
Data also released by the ONS on Tuesday showed that factory gate prices fell by 1.6 percent in yearly terms in May, the slowest fall since December of 2014 and in line with economists' predictions.
Growth in house prices showed its biggest slowdown in 10 years in April, the ONS said, reflecting uncertainty about May's national election and tax changes in Scotland which caused buyers to bring forward purchases earlier in the year.
House prices rose 5.5 percent in April, slowing from 9.6 percent in March, the lowest rate of growth since December 2013.
Other gauges of house prices have suggested a pick-up in the market in the period after the election which was won by Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party.
The opposition Labour Party had proposed a new tax on expensive properties which hit the market in London in particular. The ONS said London house prices rose by 4.3 percent in the 12 months to April, down from 11.2 percent in March."

Analysts had expected the index to drop by 4.8 points to 37.1 in June.The Current Conditions Index declined to 62.9 this month from 65.7 in May, worse than expectations for a fall to 63.0.Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment slipped to 53.7 in June from 61.2 in May, disappointing forecasts for a decline to 60.3. On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1258 from around 1.1262 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7241 from 0.7244 earlier.Meanwhile, European stock markets were broadly lower.

Measures of global headline and core inflation rates had remained subdued in April.Following a moderation in growth in the March quarter, some of the recent Chinese data had been more positive. Growth of industrial production and retail sales had picked up a little and conditions in the property market had improved somewhat, particularly in the larger cities. However, growth of fixed asset investment, particularly in the real estate sector, had eased further. While the production of steel had increased over recent months, its rate of growth remained significantly lower than earlier trends. The Chinese trade data had indicated weakness in both exports and imports in recent months, although imports of Australian iron ore had continued to rise. Members noted that the Chinese authorities had eased a number of policies and announced initiatives intended to support growth.In Japan, national accounts data for the March quarter showed that economic activity had grown at a moderate pace. Wage growth had increased over the past year and the unemployment rate had declined to its lowest level in almost 20 years. For the remainder of east Asia, GDP had grown slightly below its average pace of recent years in the March quarter and both headline and core inflation had eased. In India, economic conditions had improved over the past year or so.In the United States, indicators of activity had been mixed, though more positive than suggested by the weak March quarter GDP data, which had largely reflected temporary factors. Labour market conditions had continued to improve and consumption growth had remained relatively strong. Business activity indicators had generally remained positive, though they were a little weaker than late in the preceding year.Economic conditions in the euro area had continued to improve, but the recovery remained modest and inflation continued to be well below the European Central Bank's target.Overall, commodity prices had been little changed since the previous meeting. The prices of coal and base metals had fallen, while the price of iron ore had increased.Domestic Economic ConditionsMembers noted that the March quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. The data available prior to the meeting suggested that GDP growth had been close to average in the quarter, although below average on a year-ended basis. Growth in household consumption for the March quarter was expected to have been around average, while both dwelling investment and resource exports appeared to have been growing strongly. In contrast, business investment was likely to have contracted. There continued to be spare capacity in product and labour markets, despite some improvement in labour market conditions over the past six months or so.Members observed that the Australian Government Budget for 2015/16 had outlined a number of years of slightly larger deficits than had been forecast in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook update in December 2014. This mainly reflected lower commodity prices and weaker-than-expected growth of incomes. Members were informed that the budget policies were little different from what had been assumed for the forecasts presented in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. Members discussed the importance of including the fiscal positions of the states and territories in any assessment of the effect of fiscal consolidation on the aggregate economy.Growth of retail sales volumes had been around average in the March quarter. Measures of consumer sentiment had picked up noticeably in May to be a bit above average. Much of this had been attributed to the Australian Government Budget and, in particular, the announcement of tax concessions for small businesses. Liaison suggested that there had been little change in the year-ended growth of the value of retail sales in April and May.Dwelling investment looked to have grown strongly in the March quarter and forward-looking indicators of construction activity pointed to a further pick-up. Members noted that conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary across the country. Although housing price inflation had remained high in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, in Melbourne over recent months, there had been some divergence in price developments for different segments of these markets; price inflation of detached houses had increased, whereas price inflation for units had eased in both cities. Noting that housing price growth in other cities and regional areas had declined over recent months, members discussed the strength and composition of underlying supply and demand conditions in different parts of the housing market. They also observed that there was a relatively low stock of dwellings for sale in Sydney and Melbourne and that dwellings took only a short time to sell.Members noted that housing credit growth overall had been broadly steady at around 7 per cent (on a six-month-ended annualised basis), though the latest data on loan approvals had showed a pick-up. Over the past six months or so, growth in investor credit had eased back to be running at an annualised pace of a bit above 10 per cent. However, over more recent months there had been solid increases in housing loan approvals to both owner-occupiers and investors, particularly in New South Wales, following earlier declines.The available data suggested that private business investment had declined further in the March quarter, consistent with the forecast presented in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. Mining investment appeared to have fallen further, while non-mining investment looked to have been little changed over recent quarters. Members observed that there were diverging trends within the non-mining sector. Investment in some sectors, such as real estate and retail trade, had picked up in response to stronger growth in domestic demand, but investment had continued to fall in other sectors, such as manufacturing, where the rate of investment had been lower than the rate of depreciation in recent years. Members noted that a lower exchange rate would have an immediate beneficial effect on some sectors, such as tourism, but that it would need to be lower for a sustained period to have a significant effect on large investment decisions in other trade-exposed sectors.Surveys of business conditions remained a bit above their long-run averages in April. In contrast, an economy-wide measure of business confidence had remained below its long-run average level, along with various measures of capacity utilisation. Also, the second reading from the ABS capital expenditure survey of businesses' investment intentions for 2015/16 implied a fall in non-mining investment.Trade data suggested that export volumes had increased strongly in the March quarter across most categories, including bulk commodities. Import volumes also appeared to have increased strongly, though capital imports had remained lower than their peak in 2012.The labour force data continued to suggest that growth in employment and hours worked had been stronger over the past six months or so than the preceding period and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable at around 6¼ per cent. In April, employment had been little changed, the participation rate had ticked down and the unemployment rate had increased slightly to 6.2 per cent. Forward-looking indicators suggested that employment growth would be only modest in the coming months and most measures of job advertisements and vacancies were little changed since mid to late 2014.Wage growth had declined a little further in the March quarter and remained lower than suggested by the historical relationship between wage growth and the unemployment rate. The rise in the private sector component of the wage price index had been the lowest outcome for many years (with the exception of the September quarter 2009) and wage growth over the year to March was below its decade average in all industries. Wage growth in the public sector had also remained low, in part because of delayed negotiations over enterprise bargaining agreements. Members considered several possible explanations for the slow growth of wages, including a more flexible labour market, the relatively long period of gradually rising unemployment over recent years and below-average levels of inflation expectations generally.Financial MarketsFinancial markets continued to focus on the current negotiations between Greece and its official sector creditors and the likely timing of interest rate rises in the United States. A sharp rise in 10-year bond yields was the main development across the major financial markets over the past month.Members noted that the global rise in sovereign bond yields had been led by longer-maturity German Bunds, with those yields rising by as much as 65 basis points after reaching a historic low in mid April. The rise in yields was viewed primarily as a correction from unduly low levels, rather than a reaction to economic developments, and the sell-off only returned yields to their still low levels of late last year.Longer-term sovereign yields in most other developed countries, including Australia, also rose significantly, while increases in yields on emerging market sovereign debt were generally smaller. Following the release of the Australian Government Budget, the Australian Office of Financial Management announced updated financing requirements for 2015/16, with net issuance of Australian Government Securities expected to be around $40 billion and net debt peaking at around 18 per cent of GDP in 2016/17.In relation to the continuing negotiations between Greece and its official sector creditors, members observed that sizeable differences remained regarding the most substantive issues, including pensions and labour market reforms. Greece had been able to meet its scheduled payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in May, but Greek officials had cautioned that payments due to the IMF in June would be difficult to make without an agreement being reached with the official sector creditors. Members also noted that, consistent with reports of deposit outflows, Greek banks' use of emergency liquidity assistance had increased further during April and May.In the United States, expectations about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate had changed little over the past month, with market pricing suggesting it would happen around the end of 2015, even though comments from the Federal Reserve suggested that the first increase would occur a little sooner than that. The People's Bank of China had moved to ease monetary policy further in May when it announced another reduction in both benchmark lending and deposit rates in response to low inflation and slower growth in economic activity.Turning to foreign exchange markets, members noted that the US dollar had reversed its recent modest depreciation against most currencies, reaching its highest level against the yen since December 2002. The Chinese renminbi was little changed against the US dollar over the past month, although it had appreciated further on a trade-weighted basis and had been assessed by the IMF as being no longer undervalued. The Australian dollar had depreciated over May to be a little above its trough in early April on a trade-weighted basis.Equity prices in the major markets had shown little net change since the previous meeting. The broad index for Chinese equities had increased by 2 per cent over the past month, although the index had been volatile. Members also noted the high-profile collapses in the prices of two Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies in mid May. Australian equity prices had underperformed the major markets over May.Pass-through of the reduction in the Australian cash rate target in May to lending and deposit rates had varied across domestic financial institutions and products. At the same time, a number of banks were reported to have tightened conditions on new loans to property investors and imposed restrictions on the extent of interest rate discounts. Members noted that it would take some time for the full effects of such changes to be evident in the housing loan approvals and credit data.Market pricing indicated that the cash rate target was expected to remain unchanged at the present meeting.Considerations for Monetary PolicyMembers noted that information becoming available over the past month had not led to any material change to the global outlook, which was for growth of Australia's major trading partners to be around average over the period ahead. After somewhat weaker-than-expected economic conditions in China earlier in the year, the authorities had eased a range of policies and announced initiatives to support growth, and some of the recent data had been slightly more positive. The Federal Reserve was expected to begin the process of raising its policy interest rate later this year, but some other major central banks were continuing to ease policy. Commodity prices had been mixed over the month and little changed overall, and were significantly lower than a year earlier.Domestically, the available data suggested that output growth had continued at a below-trend pace over the past year and would remain a little below trend in the period ahead before picking up to around trend in the latter part of 2016. The national accounts data for the March quarter were expected to show that the key forces operating on the economy were much as they had been for some time. After picking up late last year, growth of household expenditure was expected to have remained strong, supported by low interest rates and strong population growth. Conditions in the housing market in Sydney and parts of Melbourne had remained very strong, though trends were more mixed in other cities. Survey-based measures of business conditions had remained around average levels. There continued to be spare capacity in labour and product markets, although there had been some improvement in labour market conditions over the past six months or so. Inflationary pressures remained well contained and were likely to remain so in the period ahead.The exchange rate was close to the lowest levels seen earlier in the year, but members noted that the current level of the exchange rate, particularly on a trade-weighted basis, continued to offer less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. A further depreciation therefore seemed both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in commodity prices over the past year.Overall, in assessing domestic conditions and the international environment, the Board's assessment was that the stance of monetary policy should be accommodative. Having eased policy at the previous meeting, members judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged and to assess information on economic and financial conditions as it became available. These data would inform the Board's assessment of the state of the economy and the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy would most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2015 01:58PM ET</span>","U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining ","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth.
The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter. 
""Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy prices linger,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month.
The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said. 
The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year.
Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations. 
Companies like  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.
The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday's data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose.
WEAK ORDERS
Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products. 
It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead. 
In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May. 
That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. 
""Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar's rise for some time yet,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
But given manufacturing's small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said ""there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.""
That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing.
GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts.
Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April.
That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over.
Companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB), the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton (N:HAL) have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year. 
Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production.

The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence surged in early June on expectations that a tightening labor market would spur big wage raises, which could further stimulate spending and overall economic growth later this year. 
The upbeat consumer sentiment survey on Friday capped off a week of strong economic data and was the latest indication that growth was regaining momentum after a sluggish start to the second quarter. 
The rise in sentiment came despite higher gasoline prices, which contributed to producer prices recording their biggest increase in more than 2-1/2 years in May.
Strong consumer confidence, together with a tightening labor market, bullish retail sales and firming inflation pressures may provide the Federal Reserve reassurance about the U.S. economic outlook amid expectations it will hike interest rates this year.
The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
""While more progress needs to be seen before the Fed feels sufficiently confident in the sustainability of the recovery, they will certainly take comfort in the fact that things are beginning to move in the right direction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Fed has kept its benchmark overnight lending rate near zero since December 2008 and is not expected to raise rates before September.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 94.6 in early June from 90.7 in May. 
Consumers were the most favorable about their personal financial prospects since 2007, with households expecting the largest wage gains since 2008. Consumers also expected inflation to remain low over the foreseeable future.
""We could get more good news on the spending front in the coming months,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at   BNP Paribas   (PARIS:BNPP) in New York. The economy contracted in the first quarter, weighed down by a host of factors, including bad weather, port disruptions and a strong dollar. Growth estimates for the second quarter were raised this week to as high as a 3.2 percent annual rate.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Friday's data as traders focused on the latest twists in Greece's debt crisis. U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks indexes also fell. 
INFLATION STABILIZING
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.5 percent last month, the largest gain since September 2012. It followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. 
The data suggested an oil-driven downward drift in prices was nearing an end. The stabilization in inflation, together with tightening labor market could see inflation rise back toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
""Inflation pressures have a heartbeat and should rise further over the next year as the economy is at or very near full employment levels,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
In the year to May, the PPI fell 1.1 percent, marking the fourth straight 12-month decrease. Prices dropped 1.3 percent in the 12 months through April, the biggest fall since 2010.
A sharp decline in crude oil prices since last year and the strong dollar have weighed on producer prices. 
Last month, gasoline prices surged 17 percent, the largest increase since August 2009. Food prices rose 0.8 percent in May, the biggest gain in just over a year, snapping five straight months of declines.
Higher food prices were driven by a shortage of eggs after an outbreak of bird flu led to the culling of millions of chickens. Wholesale egg prices soared a record 56.4 percent last month.
Higher gasoline and food prices are likely to feed into the May consumer price index. May consumer price data will be published next week.
The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, increased 0.6 percent in May after falling 0.8 percent in the prior month.
May's rise likely reflects improving profit margins at services station, which had been pressured by falling gasoline prices. 

A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services dipped 0.1 percent last month after ticking up 0.1 percent in April. The so-called core PPI was up 0.6 percent in the 12 months through May.

The University of Michigan's preliminary June reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 94.6, up from the final reading of 90.7 the month before.
It was above the median forecast of 91.5 among economists polled by Reuters.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales increased 1.2 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales advancing 1.1 percent last month. April sales were previously reported to have been unchanged. March sales were also revised to show them rising 1.5 percent instead of 1.1 percent. 
Solid retail sales data added to robust job growth in May and stabilizing manufacturing activity in suggesting the economy was finding momentum after getting off to a slow start in the second quarter. That likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this year.
The government's most recent growth estimate showed gross domestic product contracted at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the first quarter, but data on healthcare spending on Wednesday, together with revisions to construction spending, trade and wholesale inventory reports suggested output probably shrank at only a 0.1 percent rate.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.7 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent rise in April.
The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.5 percent in May after they were previously reported to have been flat in April.
Consumer spending is likely to remain fairly strong in the coming months, supported by high savings, rising house prices and a tightening labor market.
Overall retail sales last month were buoyed by a 2.0 percent jump in receipts at auto dealerships. Sales at service stations rose 3.7 percent, reflecting a rise in gasoline prices. Sales at electronic and appliance stores gained 0.1 percent, while
receipts at furniture stores increased 0.8 percent.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2015 03:52AM ET</span>",China May investment up 11.4 percent year on year,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's fixed-asset investment grew at its slowest rate in nearly 15 years in May, missing expectations even as growth in retail sales and factory output steadied, arguing for Beijing to increase policy support to avert a deeper downturn.
Fixed-asset investment, a crucial driver of the world's second-largest economy, rose 11.4 percent in the first five months of this year from the year-earlier period, missing a Reuters poll forecast for a 12 percent gain, the same as in April.
Some analysts said China's housing cooldown had crimped new investment as falling home prices dampened the mood of consumers, leading them to tighten their belts.
""The data showed the economic situation remains grim,"" said Li Huiyong, economist at Shenyin Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
""Investment is vital for stabilizing growth in the short term and the poor performance of investment is putting pressure on the economy. We previously expected second-quarter economic growth to be 7 percent, we now expect growth to slow to 6.8 percent.
Factory output grew 6.1 percent last month compared with the year-ago period, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, slightly higher than analyst forecasts for a 6 percent rise and 5.9 percent in April.
Retail sales grew 10.1 percent in May from the same time last year, in line with forecasts for 10.1 percent growth and compared with 10.0 percent in April.
The disappointing investment data followed figures earlier this week that showed China's import growth had slumped more than expected last month. Persistent weakness in the economy will strengthen calls that policymakers must do more sooner rather than later to revive growth.
Mindful that China's economy remains vulnerable to a further slowdown, Beijing tried to harness as much fiscal support as possible this week by threatening to cut the budgets of local governments if they don't spend most of their allocated cash.
China's economy is widely expected to grow around 7 percent this year -- the slowest pace in a quarter of a century. That would mark a loss of momentum from last year's 7.4 percent but would be in line with the government's 7 percent growth target.
Analysts are divided over whether the worst is over for this year.
Economists at the central bank said this week they expect growth to pick up modestly in the next six months as previous policy easing measures start to take effect and the housing market stabilizes.
But other analysts have disputed the view as being unduly optimistic, pointing to huge inventories of unsold homes, excess capacity in many heavy industries such as steel and high levels of local government debt which is curbing their ability to spend.
Stung by weak demand and China's nationwide reform efforts to move manufacturers up the value chain, China's factory output have grown at an average monthly rate of about 6 percent this year, almost a third of the pace seen in 2007.
Cooling inflation and falling producer prices have further compounded their pain by elevating their real borrowing costs. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates that China's real interest rates are close to 3 percent, well above real U.S. rates which are around negative 2 percent, which implies that banks are paying borrowers to take out loans.
Sputtering factories have in turn weighed on banks, especially in industrial areas.
Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Bank of China (SS:601988) (HK:3988), the country's fourth-largest lender, is missing its profit target in Zhejiang, a manufacturing stronghold where thousands of factories have shut in the past three years.

Market was pricing around 60% chance of a 25 basis points cut.Instead the New Zealand central bank signaled growing concern about the effect of falling commodity prices, especially dairy, on the country's' economy, and minimal consumer price index (CPI) inflation levels.For the full text statement:""Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:The Reserve Bank today reduced the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.Growth in the global economy remains moderate. Data on economic activity in the US, China and Australia has been mixed, although there has been some improvement in the euro area and Japan. Volatility in financial markets has increased.The New Zealand economy is growing at an annual rate around three percent, supported by low interest rates, high net migration and construction activity, and the decline in fuel prices. However, the fall in export commodity prices that began in mid-2014 is proving more pronounced. The weaker prospects for dairy prices and the recent rises in petrol prices will slow income and demand growth and increase the risk that the return of inflation to the mid-point would be delayed.Inflation has been low due to falling import prices and the strong growth in the economy's supply potential. Wage inflation and inflation expectations have been subdued.With the fall in commodity prices and the expected weakening in demand, the exchange rate has declined from its recent peak in April, but remains overvalued. A further significant downward adjustment is justified. In light of the forecast deterioration in the current account balance, such an exchange rate adjustment is needed to put New Zealand's net external position on a more sustainable path.House prices in Auckland continue to increase rapidly, and increased supply is needed to address this. The proposed LVR measures and the Government's tax initiatives planned for 1 October 2015 should ease the impact of investor activity.A reduction in the OCR is appropriate given low inflationary pressures and the expected weakening in demand, and to ensure that medium term inflation converges towards the middle of the target range.We expect further easing may be appropriate. This will depend on the emerging data."""

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a $98 billion deficit for last month. The deficit was $130 billion in May of 2014, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
The current fiscal year-to-date deficit stood at $365 billion at the end of last month.

Receipts last month were $212 billion, up 6 percent from the same period last year, while outlays were $295 billion, down 11 percent from the same period last year, Treasury said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2015 01:25PM ET</span>",U.S. services data suggest upward revision to first-quarter GDP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy was probably not as weak as has been reported in the first quarter, with data on Wednesday showing slightly stronger consumer spending than previously estimated.
The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed consumption, including healthcare spending, increased at a faster clip than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month.
Economists said the data suggested first-quarter consumer spending could be bumped up by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.2 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third GDP estimate on June 24.
""The survey data suggest better spending on healthcare services, in particular at outpatient care facilities and other medical service providers,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
The QSS also suggested mild downward revisions to spending on intellectual property products.
That, together with revisions for construction spending, trade and wholesale inventory data, suggests first-quarter GDP could be revised to show it contracting at a pace of about 0.2 percent instead of the 0.7 percent pace of decline the government reported last month. 
The QSS has been a significant source of revisions, especially last year as major provisions of President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law came into effect. 
Unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar, disruptions at West Coast ports and energy sector spending cuts in response to lower oil prices weighed on output in the first quarter.
A problem with the government model used to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations has been blamed for the drop in GDP. Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality.

The government said last month it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April and small business confidence perked up in May, suggesting the economy was regaining speed after stumbling at the start of the year.
The economy's stronger tone was reinforced by other data on Tuesday showing a solid rise in wholesale inventories in April, in part as oil prices stabilized.
""This is more confirmation that the economy is indeed emerging from that soft patch in the first quarter and can still pick up even faster in the next few months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 5.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 million in April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS).
Hiring slipped to 5.0 million from 5.1 million in March. Economists say the lag in hiring suggests that employers cannot find qualified workers for the open positions.
The number of unemployed job seekers per open job, a measure of labor market slack, fell to 1.6 in April, the lowest since 2007 and down from 1.7 in March.
""On balance, we read the April JOLTS data as suggesting labor market momentum remains intact in the second quarter and labor market slack continues to diminish,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York. 
The JOLTS report is one of the indicators being closely watched by Federal Reserve policymakers as they contemplate raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank has kept the short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008.
Tightening labor market conditions were corroborated by a separate report from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed confidence among small businesses rising to a five-month high in May. 
The share of businesses saying they could not fill open positions also increased to 29 percent last month, matching February's reading, which was the highest since April 2006.
REGAINING STEAM
The economy contracted at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the first quarter and growth got off to a slow start in the second quarter, in part because of the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector. 
But a surge in job growth and automobile sales as well as gains in May factory activity suggest the economy is strengthening.
Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while U.S. stock indexes edged up. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 0.4 percent in April after rising 0.2 percent in March. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - rose 0.2 percent, prompting economists at Barclays to bump up their second-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.9 percent annualized rate.
Sales at wholesalers surged 1.6 percent in April, the largest rise since March of last year. Sales had been weak since last August, in part due to the negative impact of lower oil prices on the value of petroleum goods sales. 
That had led to an accumulation of inventory, leaving wholesalers with little appetite to buy more merchandise.
Petroleum sales jumped 4.9 percent in April.
At April's sales pace it would take 1.29 months to clear shelves, down from 1.30 months in March. An inventory-to-sales ratio that high usually means an unwanted inventory buildup, which would require businesses to liquidate stocks. That would weigh on manufacturing and economic growth.
Economists, however, caution against reading too much into the elevated inventory-to-sales ratio, given the role that oil prices have played in depressing the value of petroleum goods sales. 

Still, they expect an inventory drawdown in the quarters ahead, which is one of the reasons for less robust second-quarter GDP growth estimates. Inventories added a third of a percentage point to first-quarter GDP.

China's exports in May fell less than expected but a double-digit drop in imports will likely keep the pressure on Beijing for more stimulus to avert a sharper economic slowdown.
China's exporters have been struggling to cope with weak overseas demand, rising labor and currency costs, exacerbating downward pressure on the world's second-largest economy.
Exports in May fell 2.5 percent from a year earlier and imports slid 17.6 percent, data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday showed.
That left the country with a near record trade surplus of $59.49 billion for the month.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fell 5.0 percent in May from a year ago, following a surprising 6.4 percent fall in April, and predicted imports would fall 10.7 percent, versus a 16.2 percent slide in April.
""A slightly improved export figure does not mean the condition is substantially better. Chinese companies still lack bargaining power in global markets due to the relative strength of the Chinese currency,"" Liu Yaxin, macro strategist at China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen.
""Overall, the data shows the Chinese economy is still in the process of seeking a bottom. We expect trade conditions to continue to be sluggish in the following 4-5 months, with more government policy rolling out to stabilize (the economy).""
The yuan has gained against major non-dollar currencies in recent months, leading to its rise on a trade-weight basis, but Premier Li Keqiang has ruled out a devaluation.
China's trade grew 3.4 percent in 2014, missing the government's growth target of 7.5 percent by more than half.
The government has lowered its growth target for 2015, with combined imports and exports expected to rise around 6 percent.
The government is due to release inflation data on Tuesday and industrial output, investment and retail sales numbers on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters expected some signs of steadying in the economy thanks to stimulus measures, but analysts say more support is needed to counter headwinds from a property downturn and patchy exports.
China cut interest rates for the third time in six months in May - on top of two reductions in the amount of money banks must keep in reserve - in a bid to lower borrowing costs and stoke a sputtering economy that is headed for its worst year in a quarter of a century.
Many analysts have already penciled in sub-7 percent growth for the second quarter, raising the risk that the government will not meet its full-year growth target of around 7 percent."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in May and wages picked up, signs of strong momentum in the economy that bolster prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 280,000 last month, the largest gain since December, the Labor Department said on Friday.
While the unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent from a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent in April, that was because more people, including new college graduates, entered the labor force, indicating confidence in the jobs market.
""Today's strong jobs report shows that the underlying trend in the economy is continuing to improve. This leaves the Fed on course to start hiking rates in September,"" said Michelle Meyer, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
The report joined May automobile sales and manufacturing data in suggesting economic activity was gaining traction after a slow start in the second quarter.
Doubts had sprung up in financial markets over whether the Fed would be able to raise rates this year after a first-quarter contraction in GDP and a string of weak data in April, including soft figures on consumer spending and industrial production.
The jobs data helped dispel those doubts. The dollar rallied, hitting a 13-year peak versus the yen. Prices for U.S. government debt dropped sharply, with the yield on the two-year note rising to a more than four-year high. U.S. stocks, however, were little changed.
Average hourly earnings, which had long been the missing piece in the jobs recovery and one closely watched by Fed policymakers, rose eights cents. In addition, payrolls for March and April were revised to show 32,000 more jobs created than previously reported, giving the report a healthy glow.
Traders in futures markets brought up their expectations for a rate hike to October from December. Fed officials, who have kept overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008, meet on June 16-17 to plot their course.
GAINING MOMENTUM
Economists had forecast payrolls rising 225,000 last month, with the unemployment rate steady. May's payroll gains lifted job growth above last year's average of 260,000 jobs per month.
Despite last month's rise in the jobless rate, it remains not too far from the 5.0-5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
Policymakers will also be encouraged by the return of some discouraged job seekers to the labor market.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased 0.1 percentage point to 62.9 percent, a four-month high. The number of discouraged workers in May was the lowest since October 2008, and the percentage of the working-age population employed hit its highest level since June 2009.
""These formerly frustrated workers are returning to the labor force as a pick-up in hiring activity and record-high job openings have been increasing their chances of finding a job,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
In May, 28.6 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, the lowest rate in six years. A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment was unchanged at 10.8 percent.
Last month's increase in average hourly earnings took the year-on-year gain to 2.3 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. The mix of jobs gains and higher wages lifted the aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, 0.5 percent in May and 4.9 percent over the year. 
Further gains are expected given firming demand for entry-level workers and a better composition of jobs that are being created. In addition, many states have raised the minimum wage and some corporations are increasing pay for workers.
Walmart (N:WMT), the largest private employer in the United States, this week announced it would raise minimum wages for more than 100,000 U.S. workers, its second wage hike this year.
Payroll gains last month were broad-based, though the mining sector purged jobs again as it continued to work through the thousands of cuts announced by oil-field companies. The 18,000 mining jobs lost in May marked a fifth straight monthly decline.
Among sector heavyweights, Schlumberger (N:SLB) has announced about 20,000 layoffs this year, while  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) and Halliburton (N:HAL) are also cutting thousands of jobs.
Manufacturing employment increased 7,000, while construction employment payrolls rose by 17,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. nonfarm productivity fell more sharply than initially thought in the first quarter, leading to a jump in labor-related production costs, a trend that could ignite inflation if sustained.
Other data on Thursday showed the labor market tightening, with first-time applications for unemployment aid falling last week and the number of people on benefit rolls hitting the lowest level since 2000. The reports likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year.
""It's not our base case, but should productivity growth remain muted, this would increase the risk for a more rapid pickup in inflation and potentially require a faster hiking cycle than the Fed currently foresees,"" said Michael Hanson, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
Productivity fell at a 3.1 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 1.9 percent pace, marking the first back-to-back fall since 2006, the Labor Department said. It rose only 0.3 percent from a year ago.
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), productivity was up a meager 0.6 percent annualized over the past five years, the worst five-year run since the early 1980s and the worst five-year performance on record outside of a recession.
The data came as the International Monetary Fund, in its annual assessment of the U.S. economy, said the U.S. central bank should delay hiking rates until the first half of 2016.
U.S. financial markets were largely unmoved by the data as investors focused on a global bond sell-off. The dollar fell against the euro while U.S. stocks were trading lower. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose.
While the productivity decline mirrors the economy's dismal performance in the first quarter, when gross domestic product contracted at a 0.7 percent rate, it has also been stifled by inadequate investment in capital.
INVESTMENT LACKING
""The labor productivity trend has been crushed by lack of investment leading to an unprecedented decline in capital intensity. The ratio of capital services per hour worked fell slightly in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the first run of three declines on record,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
But the drop in first-quarter productivity could be overstated, given a confluence of temporary factors that weighed on GDP. A rebound is expected in the second half of the year as businesses spend more on research and development, as well as on software and equipment.
Still, weak productivity suggests the economy's potential growth could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent pace economists currently estimate.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at an upwardly revised 6.7 percent rate in the first quarter, the fastest pace in a year. They were previously reported to have increased at a 5.0 percent rate.
Unit labor costs rose at a 1.8 percent pace compared to the first quarter of 2014, a sign wage inflation is benign for now.
""The Fed is assuming a rebound in productivity which will allow them to gradually tighten monetary policy. If the current trend continues into 2016 and 2017, the Fed will have to tighten monetary policy much more quickly,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester in Pennsylvania.
In another report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 for the week ended May 30. It was the 13th straight week that claims held below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
The tightening jobs market underscores the economy's solid fundamentals even though growth is struggling to regain steam.
The economy got off to slow start in the second quarter in part because a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector constrained manufacturing activity.
There are, however, signs of some pickup, with data this week showing a surge in automobile sales in May and gains in factory activity for the first time since November. In addition, the trade deficit narrowed sharply in April and construction spending hit its highest level since November 2008.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell to its lowest level since November 2000.

The four-week moving average was 274,750, an increase of 4,750 from the previous week’s total of 272,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April on a drop in imports, which surged in March following the end of a West Coast ports labor dispute, while companies picked up their hiring in May after a pullback the previous month.
The data supported the notion the U.S. economy has recovered somewhat from a first-quarter contraction and bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve may consider raising interest rates later this year.
Not all the news on Wednesday was as encouraging.
Two private reports signaled slower growth in the U.S. services sector, which has propped up the economy as it faced drags from a strong dollar, a recent rise in oil costs and sluggish demand abroad.
""This is consistent with modest growth. It's enough for the Fed to consider tightening. September is very much on the table,"" said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
U.S. central bank, which will hold a policy meeting June 16-17, concurred with that view in its latest Beige Book released on Wednesday.
This collection of anecdotes on the economy from early April to late May showed U.S. growth will continue at a ""modest"" to ""moderate"" pace, despite weakness in metal and energy industries and a strong dollar crimping exports.
U.S. stock indexes gained 0.4-0.5 percent after the data. The dollar and prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, which traders said was due more to the selling of German Bunds and gains in the euro after the European Central Bank upgraded its inflation outlook.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday said the trade gap narrowed to $40.9 billion from March's revised deficit of $50.6 billion. The 19.2 percent drop in the April trade deficit was the largest decrease since early 2009, and the deficit was about $3 billion less than forecast.
Imports fell 3.3 percent to $230.8 billion as West Coast
ports, a key gateway for goods to and from Asia, cleared a
backlog created by a labor dispute that was settled earlier this year.
Exports increased 1.0 percent to $189.9 billion in April with foreign sales of U.S. services edging up to a record high of $60.9 billion. In recent months, the strength of the dollar has made U.S. goods and services more expensive abroad.
The April petroleum deficit stood at $6.8 billion, the
lowest since March 2002.
The latest trade data led  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to raise its forecast of U.S. economic growth in the second quarter to 2.7 percent from 2.2 percent.
EYES ON PAYROLLS
Meanwhile, private employers added 201,000 jobs in May, the most since January, payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday.
That was in line with analyst forecasts and higher than a revised 165,000 jobs in April, which were the fewest since January 2014.
The ADP data came ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for total U.S. employment to have grown by 225,000 jobs in May, similar to April's 223,000 increase. The unemployment rate is seen holding at a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent.
Flying in the face of the better trade and jobs outlook, other data showed services industries booked fewer new orders last month.
Financial firm Markit said its final May reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services industry slipped to 56.2, its lowest since January.

The Institute for Supply Management's own services sector gauge fell to 55.7 last month, its weakest since April 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell in April on weak demand for transportation equipment and other goods, suggesting that manufacturing remained constrained by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
The outlook for manufacturing and the broader economy, however, got a lift from another report on Tuesday showing automobile sales in May rising at their briskest pace in a decade.
""The outlook for manufacturing is modestly positive. Demand from consumers and businesses is growing slowly. Households are gradually boosting their spending on manufactured goods,"" said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
New orders for manufactured goods slipped 0.4 percent after increasing 2.2 percent in March. Factory orders have declined in eight of the last nine months. Economists had forecast orders to be unchanged in April. Excluding the volatile transport component, orders were flat for a second straight month.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are pressuring the profits of multinational corporations and oil-field firms. 
Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.4 percent in April. There also were declines in orders for information technology equipment, computers and related products, and consumer goods.
Separately, auto sales last month rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.79 million units, the strongest since summer 2005, up from a 16.50 million-unit pace in April. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) reported a 3 percent increase.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said sales rose 4 percent. Ford Motor Co's (N:F) sales, however, fell 1 percent as demand for its F-Series pickup trucks slackened. 
Strong auto sales could buoy May consumer spending, which was flat in April after households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. A rebound in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is being eyed after slowing down sharply in the first quarter.
Consumer spending was sluggish even as households got a boost from cheaper gasoline and steadily rising wages.
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC 
""We have been looking for a bounce back in consumption growth following the puzzlingly weak April data and today's sales reports from auto manufacturers suggest these gains are starting to materialize,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
The dollar fell sharply against the euro on hopes that Greece would reach a deal with its creditors. Prices for U.S. government also dropped, while U.S. stocks rose marginally.
There is cautious hope that consumer spending will offset the drag on growth from continued cutbacks in business spending.
Gross domestic product contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. 
Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard warned on Tuesday the economic weakness at the start of the year could be more than transitory, citing the dollar and sluggish business investment.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, fell 0.3 percent in April instead of the 1.0 percent advance reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were revised down to show only a 0.5 percent gain in April instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent rise.
Lower oil prices prompted Schlumberger (N:SLB), the world's top oil-field services provider, and rival Halliburton (N:HAL) to slash their capital expenditure for this year. 
Multinational corporations including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR), the global home appliances giant, have warned that the dollar will hurt profits this year.
But there are signs the downturn could be nearing its end as the dollar rally fades, the supply chain normalizes after being disrupted by a labor dispute at West Coast ports and business spending outside the energy sector picks up.
A report on Monday showed factory activity rising for the first time in seven months in May and new orders increasing solidly. 

""We are moving past the weakest period for energy-related capex ... which should be a positive development for the manufacturing sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone returned to inflation in May with a higher than expected increase in consumer prices after five months of falls and stagnation, due to rising food costs and the waning impact of cheap energy.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent year-on-year last month after a flat reading in April, beating market expectations of a 0.2 percent increase.
The Eurostat estimate does not contain monthly data, but the annual data showed that more expensive unprocessed food and services had the biggest upward impact on the overall index.
Excluding the volatile energy prices, which were 5 percent lower in May than 12 months earlier, consumer prices rose 1.0 percent.
Excluding energy and unprocessed food -- or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation -- prices were up 0.9 percent, a nine-month high, accelerating from a revised 0.7 percent in April.
""It was a positive surprise, especially the core figure,"" said Teunis Brosens, economist at ING bank. 
""It has been flat around 0.6-0.7 percent since September. Normally, I would not normally be interested in a 0.2-0.3 percentage point change in core inflation, but in the circumstances it's good news,"" he said.
The stronger than expected numbers came a day after data showed German consumer prices rising at their fastest in eight months in May.
The inflation rebound could mean that the ECB's sovereign bond buying programme, called quantitative easing or QE, and launched in March with the aim of injecting more cash into the economy to prevent deflation, has brought rapid results.
This in turn will raise questions among economists whether the ECB needs to continue with the plan until its scheduled end date of September 2016.
""The ECB is clearly keen to dilute any market questioning of whether its quantitative easing programme will need to be fully implemented -- given improved euro zone growth and the exit from deflation -- thereby trying to keep downward pressure on the euro and euro zone bond yields,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. 
Prices at factory gates in April added some uncertainty to the inflation outlook, however, falling 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline.
That was weaker than market expectations of a 0.1 percent monthly rise and a 2.0 percent annual fall.

Producer prices are an indication of inflationary pressure early in the pipeline, because unless their changes are absorbed by retailers via profit margins, they tend to translate into consumer prices.

1120,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 02, 2015 03:45AM ET</span>",India's Central Bank Cuts Key Interest Rate Again,"By Reuters -

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut interest rates for a third time this year on Tuesday, taking advantage of subdued inflation to give more support to an economy that many economists doubt is doing as well as latest impressive growth numbers suggest.
The RBI's quarter point reduction in the repo rate to 7.25 percent was predicted by 35 of 48 analysts polled by Reuters. Previous cuts, in January and March, had also been by 25 basis points.
The reduction showed policymakers recognized the need to put the economy on a sounder footing, regardless of data released on Friday that showed India outpaced China by growing 7.5 percent in the March quarter.
Many economists, inside and outside the government, suspect a new way used to calculate gross domestic product has overstated how fast India is rising.
""With low domestic capacity utilization, still mixed indicators of recovery, and subdued investment and credit growth, there is a case for a cut in the policy rate today,"" the RBI said in a statement.
Still, the RBI did not take any new steps to free up cash-strapped commercial banks' liquidity, which bankers had said were needed for them to lower lending rates further and pass on the benefits of monetary easing to the broader economy. Instead, the central bank urged lenders to lower their lending rates.
The RBI also warned it would closely track inflationary trends, citing risks posed to food prices if monsoon rains are weaker than expected, or global crude prices recover, or the rupee weakens due to volatility in global markets.
""A more appropriate stance is to front-load a rate cut today and then wait for data that clarify uncertainty. Meanwhile banks should pass through the sequence of rate cuts into lending rates,"" the central bank said.
The rate reduction answered calls from both the government and businesses for the RBI to do more to shore up the economy.
Corporate earnings have been dismal, growth in bank lending has been the lowest in almost two decades, and weak industrial output data is at odds with the strong GDP numbers.
Still, there are considerable hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic reforms and aggressive spending on infrastructure will solidify the gains in economic growth.
Markets had already discounted a rate reduction and the after the move the broader Nifty stood 1.1 percent down from Monday's close. The rupee was little changed at 63.76 per dollar, having ended Monday at 63.72.
The latest rate reduction showed the central bank's confidence that that economy was in good shape to withstand any market turbulence when the Federal Reserve finally decides to raise interest rates, as it is expected to do later this year.
The RBI reduction came just weeks after China made its third interest rate reduction in six months, but growth in India's giant neighbor has been slowing down.
Having embarked on an easing cycle in January, the RBI's latest move completed a reversal of the rate increases ordered by Governor Raghuram Rajan between September 2013 to January 2014, when India was suffering double-digit inflation.
Under a new monetary policy framework adopted this year, controlling inflation is RBI's sole mandate. Weak global oil prices are helping the central bank to achieve its goals.
Consumer price inflation hit a four-month low of 4.87 percent in April, well within the RBI's target range of 2 to 6 percent, but the central bank on Tuesday projected a rise to 6.0 percent in January 2016."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending growth unexpectedly stalled in April as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and continued to boost savings, suggesting the economy was struggling to gain momentum early in the second quarter.
But after a slump in economic growth in the first quarter, there are signs of a rebound, with other reports on Monday showing manufacturing activity picked up in May for the first time in seven months and construction spending surged in April to a near 6-1/2-year high.
Still, sluggish consumer spending growth this year and muted inflation pressures suggest the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates until later this year. 
The Commerce Department said April's unchanged reading in consumer spending growth compared with analysts' forecasts for a 0.2 percent rise and followed a 0.5 percent increase in March.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was also curbed by weak demand for utilities such as electricity and natural gas as temperatures warmed up. 
The core personal consumption price index (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, edged up 0.1 percent in the 12 months to April, the smallest gain since October 2009, after rising 0.3 percent in March.
Excluding food and energy, the core PCE price index increased 1.2 percent from a year ago after being up 1.3 percent in March. 
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION GROWING
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its national factory activity index rose to 52.8 last month from 51.5 in April. 
The index had been declining since November as manufacturing battled a strong U.S. dollar and deep spending cuts in the energy sector in response to a plunge in crude oil prices in the past year. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
The index, which was also restrained by labor disruptions at the West Coast ports, was boosted by a surge in new orders and factory employment.
""The construction and manufacturing data cast a bit of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day for economic data. We need to see more of a rebound in growth before the Fed pulls the trigger on interest rates,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
However, another survey from financial data firm Markit showed factory activity improved toward the end of May.
""After transitory weakness in the first quarter, the manufacturing outlook has improved. But the dollar and lower oil prices continue to be a drag on some select industries,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The U.S. dollar firmed against major currencies on Monday, while yields on U.S. government bonds rose. U.S. stocks ended modestly higher.
In other data published Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending jumped 2.2 percent to an annual rate of $1.0 trillion, the highest level since November 2008. The percent increase was the largest since May 2012 and reflected broad gains in both private and public outlays.
GROWTH FORECASTS RAISED
Gross domestic product contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. 
But given that a confluence of temporary factors conspired to depress the output figure in the first quarter, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth seasonal fluctuations, the decline in GDP likely overstates the economy's weakness, and more recent data has lead some analysts to raise their economic growth forecasts.
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Monday raised its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.0 percent rate on the construction report.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lifted its estimate to a 2.1 percent rate from a 1.6 percent pace, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bumped up its estimate by one-tenth of a point to a 2.5 percent rate.
The manufacturing and construction reports on Monday, combined with data on business spending plans, employment and housing in recent weeks, suggested some momentum in the economy even though consumer spending and industrial production have been soft. 
The weakness in consumer spending is puzzling some analysts given that wages are rising and households accumulated hefty savings from cheaper gasoline.
""Most likely, Americans are using their pump price savings to pay down debt, increase the money they put aside and for dining out,"" said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
In April, personal income rose 0.4 percent and the saving rate increased to 5.6 percent from 5.2 percent in March, according to the Commerce Dept on Monday.

Construction spending jumped 2.2 percent to an annual rate of $1.0 trillion, the highest level since November 2008, the Commerce Department said on Monday. The percent increase was the largest since May 2012.
March's outlays were revised to show a 0.5 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent fall. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.7 percent in April.
The report adds to business spending plans, employment and housing data in suggesting some momentum in the economy early in the second quarter even as consumer spending and industrial production have been soft.
The economy contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter.

But with output held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations, the decline in gross domestic product likely overstates the economy's weakness.
In April, construction spending was buoyed by a 1.8 percent increase in private construction spending to the highest level since October 2008. Outlays on private residential construction rose 0.6 percent and spending on private non-residential construction projects jumped 3.1 percent to a six-year high.
Public construction outlays soared 3.3 percent as spending on state and local government projects - the largest portion of the public sector segment - offset a 3.6 percent decline in federal government outlays.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2015 07:55AM ET</span>","China HSBC PMI at 49.2 in May, contracts third month, export orders near two-year low","BEIJING, (Reuters) - Activity in China vast factory sector shrank for a third consecutive month in May as export orders contracted at the sharpest rate in nearly two years, a private survey showed on Monday, suggesting China remains locked in an economic cooldown.
The final HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.2 in May, below the 50-point level that separates an expansion from a contraction in activity on a monthly basis.
That is little changed from a preliminary reading of 49.1, and up a touch from April's 48.9.
In a sign that China's sputtering economy could face bigger headwinds in the short-term, a sub-index for new exports skidded to 46.7, a low unseen since June 2013, and well below April's 50.3.
Factory output also shrank for the first time this year as the sub-index slipped under 50.
""A solid fall in new export work contributed to fewer new orders, which in turn led to the first contraction of output in 2015 so far,"" said Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.
Add to that persistent job losses and reduced factory purchases, Qu said the data called for more stimulus measures to stoke domestic demand and economic growth.
HSBC/Markit said companies had reported a broad weakening in overseas demand last month, which reduced factory production and fueled job cuts among manufacturers.
The PMI showed factory employment shrank in May for the 18th straight month, even though the pace of contraction eased from the rates seen in March and April.
As the economy softened, deflationary pressure remained stubborn. The sub-indices for input and output prices were a good way under 50 points, though the rate of decline in input prices eased markedly.
China's economy has foundered this year as a cooling housing market and slowing growth in exports, domestic investment and consumption knocked growth to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first three months of the year.
Cooling inflationary pressure is especially problematic for China as it raises the real cost of borrowing for private firms, the biggest employers in the country but which are often denied of credit by banks.
Many analysts expect China's economy to grow 7 percent this year compared to 2014, the weakest rate in a quarter of a century and down from a 7.4 percent expansion last year.

That has fueled speculation that China's central bank, which has cut interest rates three times in six months, is likely to lower rates again this year.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone factory growth was weaker than previously thought last month as the bloc's core countries continued to struggle, a survey of businesses showed on Monday.
That is likely to disappoint the European Central Bank, which is battling to get inflation even close to its target, as will the survey's finding that factories held prices in May after raising them in April for the first time in eight months.
To restore economic growth and combat deflation, the ECB started buying around 60 billion euros a month of mainly government bonds in March and the survey suggested it is having at least some effect. 
Markit's final May manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 52.2, below a preliminary flash reading of 52.3 but just ahead of April's 52.0. It was the 23rd month it has been above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The rate of growth is modest rather than spectacular, however, and there are clearly countries which continue to struggle,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
""Weakness is centered in the region's core, with France's manufacturing sector still in decline and Germany only seeing very meager growth.""
Earlier factory PMIs from Germany and France were 51.1 and 49.4 respectively. 
New business across the bloc came in at its fastest rate for over a year, however, driven by export demand as consumers took advantage of a weaker euro making goods cheaper. A new orders sub-index jumped to a 13-month high of 52.7 from 51.8. 
That meant the output index, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as a good growth indicator, only dipped slightly to 53.3 from April's 53.4. The flash reading was 53.5.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's giant factory sector edged up to a six-month high in May but export demand shrank again, prompting companies to shed jobs and keeping alive worries about a protracted economic slowdown, a government survey showed on Monday.
In a sign that China's worst downturn in at least six years is hurting its services companies, too, a similar survey showed growth in that sector slipped to a low not seen in more than five years.
Services have been one of the lone bright spots in the Chinese economy in the last year.
The muted reports reinforced the view that authorities would have to roll out more stimulus in coming months, despite having cut interest rates three times in six months.
""China's economy still faces strong headwinds,"" economists at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients.
""If capital outflow continues at the pace of the first quarter, we expect the People's Bank of China to cut the reserve requirement ratio by another 100 basis points, in addition to a further interest rate cut of at least 25 basis points.""
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 50.2 from April's 50.1, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website, in line with analysts' forecast for a 50.2 reading.
A reading above 50 points indicates growth on a monthly basis, while one below that points to contraction.
The non-manufacturing PMI, on the other hand, slipped to 53.2, a trough not seen since December 2008 and compared with April's 53.4, the NBS said.
However, Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, which helps to compile the government PMI polls, argued that a rise in overall new orders in factories pointed to some steadying in market demand.
""This shows stabilization in economic growth,"" Zhang said.
BETS ON MORE AGGRESSIVE EASING
China's economy has sputtered this year as a cooling housing market and slowing growth in exports, domestic investment and consumption knocked growth to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first three months of the year.
In addition, a frothy Chinese stock market that has nearly doubled (CSI300) in the last 18 months is feeding concerns that easier credit policies are driving up share prices and fuelling speculation, drawing money away from real economic activity and further complicating policy making.
While official surveys tend to center on larger, state-owned firms, a private survey that focuses on small and mid-sized factories showed growth shrank for the third straight month as export orders fell at the sharpest rate in nearly two years.
The final HSBC/Markit PMI stood at 49.2 in May, little changed from a preliminary reading of 49.1, and up a touch from April's 48.9.
""Five months into 2015, the economy sees little sign of a pickup,"" HSBC said in a note on Monday, adding that an index created by the bank suggests that monetary conditions in China have tightened.
""We forecast more aggressive policy easing, including a 50-basis-point reserve ratio cut in the coming weeks,"" HSBC said.
As the economy cools, the country has fought persistent deflationary pressure, which has in turn kept real interest rates stubbornly high.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report this month that real interest rates in China are over 3 percent, well above real rates in Japan, Europe and the United States, where borrowing costs are negative.
Given that China's flurry of policy easing has yet to arrest its economic downturn, an economist at a state think-tank warned over the weekend that the world's second-biggest economy is unlikely to rebound soon.
Instead, he said growth would stabilize at a lower level and at best track a ""L-shaped"" trajectory.
China's economic growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014.

As the first major indicator that is released each month, China's official manufacturing PMI is closely watched by investors for clues about the health of the Chinese economy.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2015 10:29PM ET</span>","Japan May final manufacturing PMI 50.9, back in expansion after rocky April","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in May for the first time in two months as domestic orders and output rose, suggesting the economy may be grinding higher again after faltering in April. 
The Markit/JMMA final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.9 in May, unchanged from the preliminary reading but higher than a final 49.9 in April.
The index returned above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time in two months.
New orders rose to 50.9, versus a flash estimate of 51.2 and a final 48.8 in April.
The output index rose to 51.9, slightly more than the flash estimate of 51.7 and 49.3 in April.
The index for new export orders was 50.6, slightly above a preliminary 51.2 and a final 50.3 in the previous month.
An expanding manufacturing sector is important for the economy because it would suggest domestic demand is becoming stronger, which would lead to higher growth and make it more likely that the Bank of Japan can meet its 2 percent inflation target. 
Data on Friday showed household spending unexpectedly slumped in April and consumer inflation was roughly flat, casting doubt on the central bank's forecast for a slow but steady economic recovery and reinforcing expectations it will have to pump more stimulus into the economy later in the year.
Industrial output rose a modest 1 percent, the first increase in three months, though manufacturers expected a smaller gain in May and a slight drop in June.
April exports grew more than expected from a year earlier but fell from March - a worrying portent for external demand as a slowdown in the economies of China and the U.S. clouds the outlook for Asia's exporters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly.
The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month.
A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending. 
With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic.
Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production.
But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. 
Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.
Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years.
They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.
""Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) in Dallas. ""We're going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.""
When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output.
U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. 
DOLLAR, ENERGY DRAG
Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) responded to the plunge in crude oil prices.
Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009. 
Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth.
Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved.
That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month.
The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms.
Multinationals like  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), household products maker Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year. 
Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity. 
But growth could accelerate as the year progresses.
The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month. 
That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories.
While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline. 
Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace.
""The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose for a fourth straight month in April to a nine-year high, buoying the outlook for the housing market and the overall economy.
While other data on Thursday showed an unexpected increase in new applications for unemployment benefits, filings remained at levels consistent with a tightening labor market.
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 3.4 percent to 112.4, the highest level since May 2006.
Generally contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase pointed to a pick-up in home resales after they lost momentum in April. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising only 0.9 percent last month.
""Today's report suggests we may see continued strength in resales in the months ahead. However, the current low inventory levels, which are placing upward pressure on home prices, remain a bit of a downside risk,"" said Derek Lindsey, an economist at  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) in New York.
The jobless claims and housing data joined upbeat reports on consumer confidence and business spending plans that have hinted the economy might finally be gaining steam as some drags on growth in the first quarter either fade or ease.
April data on retail sales and industrial production had pointed to modest growth early in the second quarter.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt slipped, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading lower as traders worried Greece could default on its debt repayments.
Firming housing and the tightening jobs market will likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this year.
JOBS SUPPORTING HOUSING
Housing is being supported by the strengthening labor market, which is encouraging young adults to move out of their parents' basements and setting up their own households.
While tight inventories are pushing up house prices and constraining activity, there is hope higher home values will encourage more homeowners to put their houses on the market and builders to break more ground on new projects.
An accelerating housing market would pick up some of the slack from weak business investment, which has been undermined by deep spending cuts in the energy sector in response to a sharp drop in oil prices. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ended May 23.
While that confounded economists' expectations for a drop to 270,000, claims stayed below 300,000, a threshold associated with a firming jobs market, for a 12th straight week, an unusually long stretch given a sluggish economic backdrop.
""The data have reinforced our view that the underlying trend in growth has not weakened significantly and that employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep unemployment trending down,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
Outside the energy sector, which has suffered thousands of job losses because of the lower oil prices, layoffs remain subdued even as economic growth struggles to rebound strongly after slumping at the start of the year. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 11,000 to 2.22 million in the week ended May 16. 
The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to its lowest level since November 2000. 
Continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's unemployment rate. The four-week average declined 70,250 between the April and May survey periods, suggesting a dip in the jobless rate from a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent last month.
""The continuing claims data continue to point to slack in the labor market diminishing,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rebounded modestly in the year to April after three straight months of falls, bolstering the central bank's case that consumer spending is reviving to underpin a steady economic recovery.
The data adds to signs of improvement in consumer confidence and eases pressure on the Bank of Japan to expand its massive stimulus program in the near term, analysts say.
Retail sales in April rose 5.0 percent from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed on Thursday, slightly below a median market forecast for a 5.4 percent increase. It followed a 9.7 percent drop in March.
The year-on-year numbers have been distorted by a surge in consumption leading up to last April's sales tax hike and a subsequent downturn after the higher levy nudged the economy into mild recession last year.
On a seasonally-adjusted month-on-month basis, retail sales rose just 0.4 percent in April after sliding 1.8 percent in March, underscoring the fragile nature of the recovery.
""Consumption is picking up but the momentum is weak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""If summer bonuses rise and a tightening job market boosts wages, we can expect spending to gather momentum around the middle of this year.""
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year in January-March, emerging from last year's recession caused by the bigger-than-expected hit on consumption from the tax hike.
The BOJ revised up its assessment of the economy last week on signs of a pick-up in private consumption, signaling that it has no plan to expand stimulus any time soon.
Household spending holds the key to the success of the central bank's massive stimulus program, which aims to nudge consumers into spending now rather than save on expectations that prices will rise in the future.

But there is uncertainty on whether consumers will shake off the ""deflationary mindset"" that beset Japan for two decades. A second sales tax hike looming in 2017 also casts doubt on whether the recovery can be sustained long enough to accelerate inflation toward the BOJ's 2 percent target.

If these developments are sustained, their net effect will need to be assessed as more data become available in the months ahead.Total inflation is near the bottom of the bank's 1%-to-3% inflation control range, largely due to the transitory effects of sharply lower energy prices. Core inflation remains above 2%, boosted by the pass-through effects of past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, as well as certain sector-specific factors.Seeing through the various temporary factors, the BoC estimates that the underlying trend of inflation is 1.6% to 1.8%, consistent with persistent slack in the economy. The outlook for the Canadian economy also remains largely in line with the outlook from April. Recent indicators suggest consumption in Canada is holding up relatively well, given the impact of lower oil prices on gross domestic income.In conclusion, policymakers judged that ""the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate.""USD/CAD was trading at 1.2453 from around 1.2437 ahead of the announcement.

Financial firm Markit said the ""flash,"" or preliminary, reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector slipped to 56.4 in May from a final reading of 57.4 in April.
A reading over 50 signals expansion in activity in the sector.
Markit's May reading of new business fell to 55.8 from April's final reading of 57.7, though a subindex on employment improved slightly.
Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, dropped to 56.1 from 57 last month. Last week, Markit's flash reading of U.S. manufacturing showed activity slowed for a second straight month in May, though it remained in expansion territory.
""The rate of expansion remains below the buoyant rates seen throughout much of last year, as slower growth of service activity has been accompanied by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which has seen exporters hit by the stronger dollar,"" Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.

The Markit surveys suggest annual gross domestic product growth could accelerate to around 3 percent in the second quarter, while the economy adds around 200,000 jobs a month, Williamson said.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2015 11:36AM ET</span>","New home sales, prices rise strongly in April","New U.S. single-family home sales rose more than expected in April and the median price surged, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday sales increased 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000 units. March's sales pace was revised up to 484,000 units from the previously reported 481,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 9.3 percent of the market, rising to a 510,000-unit pace last month.
The upbeat report added to housing starts data in indicating that housing was gaining momentum after treading water for much of last year. Economists believe housing will take the baton from a lethargic manufacturing sector and help to drive economic growth this year.
Housing is being buoyed by a strengthening jobs market, which is encouraging young adults to set up their own households.
New homes sales jumped 36.8 percent in the Midwest to a seven-year high and increased 5.8 percent in the South. Sales fell 5.6 percent in the Northeast and slipped 2.3 percent in the West.
The stock of new houses available on the market rose 0.5 percent last month to 205,000. Supply still remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom, good news for home builders who will need to ramp up construction.
At April sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.1 months in March.

With supply still tight, the median price for a new home rose 8.3 percent from a year ago to $297,300. While higher home prices could reduce affordability, they boost household equity, which could boost consumer spending.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2015 11:35AM ET</span>",Solid business spending plans offer ray of hope for factories,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment spending plans increased solidly for a second straight month in April, a hopeful sign for manufacturing activity after a long spell of weakness.
The overall economy is gradually firming, with other reports on Tuesday showing consumer confidence perking up this month and house prices extending gains in March, which should boost household equity and support consumer spending.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.0 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.5 percent increase in March.
The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 0.6 percent in March.
""It provides some indication that business capital investment activity might be on the mend,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Business spending has slackened as a sharp decline in energy prices forced oilfield companies, including Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), to slash their capital expenditure budgets. Investment has also been undermined by a strong dollar, which has squeezed profits of multinational corporations.
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 95.4 this month from 94.3 in April.
Consumers' outlook for the labor market improved, with a rise in the share of households anticipating more jobs in the months ahead. 
The rebound in business spending, together with a sturdy labor market, a strengthening housing market and firming underlying inflation, should keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates later this year.
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on the upbeat data, while prices for U.S. government debt prices rose. U.S. stocks were trading lower.
The increase in core capital goods orders offers cautious optimism that business spending outside the energy sector will pick up in the coming months and support manufacturing, and the broader economy, after a dismal first quarter.
Although order books at manufacturers remain lean, the core capital goods data corroborates other surveys, including one on small businesses, that showed a jump in capital expenditure plans in April and May.
Economic growth slumped early in the year and data so far on retail sales and manufacturing point to tepid economic activity early in the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.4 percent.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.8 percent last month after a 1.0 percent increase in March.
A 2.5 percent drop in transportation equipment, however, weighed down on overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which fell 0.5 percent last month. 
Orders for machinery recorded their biggest gain in eight months in April and the increase in bookings for primary metals was the largest since September. While orders for computers and electronic products fell 3.6 percent, that followed a hefty 7.7 percent surge in March.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 1.5 percent after gaining 0.9 percent the prior month.
In another report the Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000 units. March's sales pace was revised up to 484,000 units from the previously reported 481,000 units.
The upbeat report added to housing starts data in indicating that housing was gaining momentum after treading water for much of last year. 
A fourth report showed single-family home prices rose in March from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas increased 5 percent from a year ago, matching February's gain. 
Economists believe housing will take the baton from a lethargic manufacturing sector and help to drive economic growth this year. Housing is being buoyed by a strengthening jobs market, which is encouraging young adults to set up their own households.
While higher home prices could reduce affordability, they could encourage more homeowners to put their houses on the market, which could ease supply constraints and boost sales. In addition, higher home values boost household net worth, which is positive for consumer spending.

Singapore's economy in the first quarter grew faster than estimated as manufacturing and services sectors showed more resilience, boding well for the city-state's economic growth outlook this year.
The surprisingly strong data bolsters the case for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to hold off from additional monetary easing later this year, economists said.
The trade-reliant economy expanded an annualized and seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent in the January-March quarter from the previous three months, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday.
That far exceeded the 1.1 percent expansion in the government's advance estimate released in April, and beat a Reuters poll forecast for 1.8 percent growth.
""It was the services that really surprised on the upside. I think wholesale and retail was one number that was much stronger than we anticipated,"" said Chua Hak Bin, head of emerging Asia economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore.
""Given that growth seems to be holding up better, MAS is more likely to maintain the current weak appreciation bias despite the low inflation,"" Chua said.
Consumer prices posted their biggest annual drop in five years in April, an outcome economists said could lead to further monetary easing if economic growth disappoints.
Jacqueline Loh, deputy managing director at MAS, told a news conference the MAS does not see any material change to the inflation outlook and therefore monetary policy remains appropriate.
Annual growth in services-producing industries was revised up to 3.8 percent from the advance estimate of 3.1 percent.
Manufacturing activity shrank 2.7 percent from a year earlier, but that was still an upward revision from a 3.4 percent contraction in the advance estimate.
The ministry kept its 2015 growth estimate of 2-4 percent and forecast the economy would grow around that pace until 2020.
That medium-term forecast range ""takes into account downside risks arising from an uncertain global economic environment, as well as the expected slowdown in resident workforce growth due to our ageing population,"" said Ow Foong Pheng, permanent secretary at the ministry.
From a year earlier, GDP grew 2.6 percent in the first quarter, better than the advance estimate of 2.1 percent.
Economists said growth could pick up in coming months on an improving U.S. economy and recovering exports.
""Exports in Asia have been weak in the first quarter due to mainly transitory factors,"" and will not remain weak in the second quarter, said Michael Wan, an economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), adding that planned fiscal spending may also lift growth.
Exports are pivotal to Singapore, a country whose annual trade in goods and services amounts to about 3.5 times the size of its economy."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising shelter and medical care costs boosted underlying U.S. inflation pressures in April, a welcome sign for the Federal Reserve as it contemplates raising interest rates this year.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy, increased 0.3 percent last month. It was the largest rise in the so-called core CPI since January 2013 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in March.
Economists who had expected core inflation to increase 0.2 percent last month said the increase, which also reflected gains in the prices of household furnishings and new and used motor vehicles, should keep the U.S. central bank on track to hike rates before the end of 2015.
""It will give the Fed greater confidence that inflation will indeed make it to its target in the next couple of years, it increases the odds of faster Fed action,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
In a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she expected rates to rise this year, adding that the lift-off hinged on a firmer jobs market and signs that inflation was moving toward the Fed's target.
""I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium-term,"" Yellen said.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies on the inflation data and Yellen's comments. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while U.S. stocks were little changed.
Although slower economic growth in the first half of the year has diminished the chances of a mid-year rate hike, a tightening labor market and rising demand for housing suggest core inflation could continue to push higher this year even if medical costs subside.
Minutes of the Fed's April meeting released on Wednesday said ""many"" policymakers did not believe that the data by June ""would provide sufficient confirmation that the conditions"" for raising the key short-term interest rate had been meet.
A recent batch of weak data, including April industrial production and retail sales, has left many economists even doubting the Fed will raise rates in September.
The central bank has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008. It tracks a price measure that is running below core CPI.
In the 12 months through April, core CPI advanced 1.8 percent after a similar gain in March.
""September is still the most likely lift-off date, but July is not out of the question, particularly not if we get another couple of robust rises in core consumer prices in May and June,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
FADING DOLLAR RALLY
A fading dollar rally also was seen keeping core inflation on an upward trend. The dollar surged about 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June last year and mid-March. It has handed back some of those gains and is now up only 10 percent.
""If sustained, that should help weakness in core goods prices continue to moderate,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. 
The overall CPI edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. It was held back by a 1.7 percent drop in gasoline prices and no change in food prices. Gasoline prices, however, have since risen.
In the 12 months through April, the CPI fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009, after dipping 0.1 percent in March.
Core inflation was lifted by a 0.3 percent increase in shelter costs, which followed a similar gain in March. Shelter inflation is being driven by rising household formation, which is boosting demand for rental accommodation.
The medical care index rose 0.7 percent, the largest rise since January 2007. Household furnishings posted their largest gain since September 2008.

Prices for new and used cars and trucks rose for a third straight month. Airline fares, however, fell, as did apparel prices, which recorded their first drop since December.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2015 02:17PM ET</span>","U.S. economy tepid in early second quarter, but jobs market resilient ","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy was on a modest growth path early in the second quarter with home resales falling in April and manufacturing activity on the backfoot in May, although the labor market continued to tighten.
Growth is struggling to rebound strongly after slumping at the start of the year, weighed down by bad weather, a strong dollar, port disruptions and deep energy spending cuts.
The sturdy labor market keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Minutes of the U.S. central bank's April meeting released on Wednesday showed most policymakers saw little chance of a June rate hike because of the anemic pace of the rebound in growth so far.
""The labor market is doing well and continues to tighten. Still, the economy got off to a slow start this quarter. It seems it hasn't found a rhythm after the poor first three months of the year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales declined 3.3 percent to an annual rate of 5.04 million units last month. Despite the fall, which followed a hefty increase in March, the sales pace remained above 5 million units.
The Realtors group said sales continued to be hampered by a shortage of properties on the market, which is pushing up home prices and limiting choice for potential buyers.
But last month's drop in sales could be temporary amid signs supply is gradually improving as higher house prices encourage more sellers to put their properties on the market.
The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 10 percent from March to 2.21 million units. However, supply was down 0.9 percent from a year ago. At April's sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to clear houses from the market, up from 4.6 months in March.
The median price for a previously owned homed rose 8.9 percent in April from a year ago, the largest gain since January 2014 and marking the 38th straight month of year-over-year price increases.
""Supply constraints continue to push home prices skyward, but new home sales are picking up and new construction is beginning to follow suit. These developments should help ease supply pressures,"" said Stephanie Karol, a U.S. economist at
IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""We expect existing home sales to regain momentum in the spring and summer.""
SOFT MANUFACTURING
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index dipped to 6.7 this month from 7.5 in April. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing.
That weakness was mirrored by another report from financial data firm Markit showing its preliminary U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 53.8 this month from 54.1 in April. A reading above 50 represents growth in national factories.
Manufacturing is being pressured by a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies whose profits have been squeezed by lower crude oil prices.
There is cautious optimism, however, that a fading dollar rally could ease some of the pressure on manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed survey showed an increase in demand for manufactured goods and a rise in shipments.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000 for the week ended May 16.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to a fresh 15-year low.
Claims have been running below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strengthening labor market, for 11 straight weeks, a very rare occurrence that economists say underscores the jobs market's resilience.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of May's employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 18,750 between the April and May survey period, suggesting another month of job growth above 200,000.
Nonfarm payrolls rose 223,000 in April and the unemployment rate slipped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 12,000 to 2.21 million in the week ended May 9. That was the lowest level since November 2000.
The unemployment rate among people receiving benefits fell 0.1 percentage point to 1.6 percent, the lowest since July 2000. This rate tracks the short-term unemployment rate.

By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy was on a modest growth path early in the second quarter with home resales falling in April and manufacturing activity on the backfoot in May, although the labor market continued to tighten.
Growth is struggling to rebound strongly after slumping at the start of the year, weighed down by bad weather, a strong dollar, port disruptions and deep energy spending cuts.
The sturdy labor market keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Minutes of the U.S. central bank's April meeting released on Wednesday showed most policymakers saw little chance of a June rate hike because of the anemic pace of the rebound in growth so far.
""The labor market is doing well and continues to tighten. Still, the economy got off to a slow start this quarter. It seems it hasn't found a rhythm after the poor first three months of the year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales declined 3.3 percent to an annual rate of 5.04 million units last month. Despite the fall, which followed a hefty increase in March, the sales pace remained above 5 million units.
The Realtors group said sales continued to be hampered by a shortage of properties on the market, which is pushing up home prices and limiting choice for potential buyers.
But last month's drop in sales could be temporary amid signs supply is gradually improving as higher house prices encourage more sellers to put their properties on the market.
The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 10 percent from March to 2.21 million units. However, supply was down 0.9 percent from a year ago. At April's sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to clear houses from the market, up from 4.6 months in March.
The median price for a previously owned homed rose 8.9 percent in April from a year ago, the largest gain since January 2014 and marking the 38th straight month of year-over-year price increases.
""Supply constraints continue to push home prices skyward, but new home sales are picking up and new construction is beginning to follow suit. These developments should help ease supply pressures,"" said Stephanie Karol, a U.S. economist at
IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""We expect existing home sales to regain momentum in the spring and summer.""
SOFT MANUFACTURING
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index dipped to 6.7 this month from 7.5 in April. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing.
That weakness was mirrored by another report from financial data firm Markit showing its preliminary U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 53.8 this month from 54.1 in April. A reading above 50 represents growth in national factories.
Manufacturing is being pressured by a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies whose profits have been squeezed by lower crude oil prices.
There is cautious optimism, however, that a fading dollar rally could ease some of the pressure on manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed survey showed an increase in demand for manufactured goods and a rise in shipments.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000 for the week ended May 16.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to a fresh 15-year low.
Claims have been running below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strengthening labor market, for 11 straight weeks, a very rare occurrence that economists say underscores the jobs market's resilience.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of May's employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 18,750 between the April and May survey period, suggesting another month of job growth above 200,000.
Nonfarm payrolls rose 223,000 in April and the unemployment rate slipped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 12,000 to 2.21 million in the week ended May 9. That was the lowest level since November 2000.
The unemployment rate among people receiving benefits fell 0.1 percentage point to 1.6 percent, the lowest since July 2000. This rate tracks the short-term unemployment rate.

""With long-term unemployment on a downward trend, we would not be surprised to see the unemployment rate fall to 5.3 percent in May,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2015 11:51AM ET</span>","U.S., euro zone business growth slower, China contracts","By Jonathan Cable and Michael Connor
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and euro zone business growth slowed in May while China's factory sector contracted again, reinforcing the need for major central banks to continue supporting economic growth.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is seen unlikely to tighten monetary policy in June since the world's biggest economy barely grew at the start of the year.
Growth in euro zone business activity also weakened in May, just two months after the European Central Bank launched a 1-trillion-euro stimulus program, and an absence of inflation pressures suggested Asian authorities could inject more stimulus if needed. 
""The May (Purchasing Managers' Index) surveys were broadly disappointing although nothing terribly bad,"" said Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at TD Securities.
""There is no question the ECB is going to continue with quantitative easing up until September 2016. China is just starting the amount of additional liquidity and stimulus that will be needed to safely rebalance the economy,"" he said.

U.S. FACTORY GROWTH SLOWS FOR SECOND MONTH
Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed for a second straight month during May, with new orders rising at their slowest pace since January 2014, private data vendor Markit said on Thursday. 
The preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.8 in May from the final April reading of 54.1, although the sector's jobs growth picked up this month from April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the May reading would be 54.5. A figure above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
The index's flash output component fell to 55 from the final April reading of 55.3, and was the lowest since December 2014. The flash reading of the index measuring new orders also weakened in May, to 54.2 from April's final 55.3.
""The weaker order book trend doesn't appear to have affected hiring, at least not yet, with job creation picking up in May. However, unless production growth revives, there is a worry that payroll growth will slow as companies seek to boost productivity,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. 
EURO ZONE BUSINESS WEAKER BUT EMPLOYMENT UP 
Euro zone business growth was weaker than expected this month but firms increased staffing levels at the fastest rate in four years, according to Markit.
Any signs of growth, alongside the survey showing firms cut prices only marginally after reducing them for over three years, will cheer European Central Bank policymakers coming just two months after they launched a trillion-euro stimulus programme.
""There will be a lot of people disappointed that we have an easing in growth for the second month but it needs to be put in context that it is a reasonable number,"" said Markit's Chris Williamson. ""The broader picture is that the recovery remains on track - it's doing rather well.""
Markit's Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, based on surveys of thousands of companies and seen as a good growth indicator, fell to 53.4 from 53.9, missing the 53.8 predicted by a Reuters poll. However, firms stepped up recruitment, with the employment sub-index at 52.3, its highest reading since May 2011.
Demand from abroad for euro zone goods soared as customers took advantage of a weaker euro's making the products cheaper. The manufacturing new export orders index jumped to a 13-month high of 53.0 from 52.3.
Shares on major world markets hovered near all-time highs on Thursday. The MSCI World equity index (MIWD00000PUS) was up as much as 1.4 percent before trimming its gain to 0.4 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]
CRACKS IN CHINA
Chinese activity contracted for a third straight month as domestic and export orders shrank, adding to views Beijing will have to roll out its most aggressive stimulus measures since the global financial crisis to avert a sharper slowdown.
The flash HSBC/Markit PMI for China fell to 49.1 in May, weaker than an expected 49.3 and marking the fifth contraction in activity in six months.
""The subdued flash PMI print suggests there is no clear sign of near-term stabilisation in (China's) economy. Risks to the outlook remain to the downside,""  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) economist Shengzu Wang said.
Beijing has already cut interest rates three times in six months and economists believe it will have to ease further as economic growth threatens to slow below the 7-percent pace of the first quarter.
Analysts at Nomura saw China's growth slowing to 6.6 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, before edging up to 6.8 percent in the second half of the year. 
However, Japanese manufacturing activity rebounded modestly in May as output and new orders picked up, suggesting a much-needed improvement in demand at home and abroad.
The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.9 in May from a final 49.9 in April. The index rose above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time in two months.
Other data showed Japan's economy expanded in January-March at the fastest pace in a year. But much of that growth came from inventories as goods piled up on factory floors, and private consumption, housing investment and exports all rose, though at a feeble pace.
Still, subdued input and output prices suggested inflation remained stubbornly low, adding to expectations the Bank of Japan will expand its already massive monetary stimulus programme later this year.

British retail sales rose more strongly than expected in April, recovering from a surprise fall in March, as unusually warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy new clothes, official data showed on Thursday.
Retail sales volumes rose 1.2 percent on the month, the strongest increase since November, to show 4.7 percent growth on the year, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists had expected retail sales to rise a monthly 0.4 percent and for sales to be up 3.8 percent compared with April last year.
The strength of the figures may further ease concerns that a slowdown in Britain's economy seen in the first quarter might be the start of a longer period of weakness.
But the sharp increase in sales was due in large part to a possible one-off surge in purchases of clothing, textiles and footwear which jumped by 5.2 percent in April from March, the biggest monthly rise in four years.
""It's a weather factor,"" an ONS official said. ""You've had warmer than average weather which has led to consumers bringing forward purchases of summer clothing.""
Excluding fuel, sales were also up by 1.2 percent in monthly terms and by 4.7 percent compared with April last year.
A drop in fuel sales in March, when oil prices showed some recovery from their previous slump, had caused overall retail sales in that month to fall by 0.7 percent.
By contrast, fuel sales in April rose 2.0 percent from March, the ONS said.
Britain's consumers have been the main driver of the country's economic recovery which began in 2013. A fall in inflation, which turned negative in April for the first time since 1960, and a pick-up in wages have helped restore some of the spending power lost in the years after the financial crisis.
The Bank of England last week noted ""robust"" growth in retail sales in the first quarter of the year but said it was too soon to know how much of the increase was due to the fall in petrol and food prices.
Sales of food fell by 0.1 percent, underscoring a weakness in demand faced by some supermarkets.
Asda, the British arm of U.S. retailer Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), reported its worst quarterly sales in more than five years on Tuesday and its chief executive said customers were ""not yet cash-confident."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at its fastest pace in a year in January-March as business investment rose slightly, but goods piling up in factory warehouses posed a potential challenge to policy makers seeking to vanquish years of deflation.
Private consumption, housing investment and exports all rose but at a feeble pace, leaving Tokyo with more work to do two years after a radical monetary stimulus program has brought only scant success.
""The growth number may look good on surface but there's not much to cheer about,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The world's third-largest economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the first three months of this year, beating a median market forecast for a 1.5 percent increase and a revised 1.1 percent expansion in October-December, data from the Cabinet Office showed on Wednesday.
The second straight quarter of expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) exceeded an annualized 0.2 percent gain in the United States and 1.6 percent growth in the euro zone, a sign Japan is steadily emerging from last year's recession.
But inventory was the biggest contributor to growth, adding 0.5 percentage point versus only 0.4 point gained by increases in domestic demand components like capital expenditure, consumption and housing investment.
""When excluding the contribution from inventory, the economy grew a meager 0.7 percent on an annualized basis,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, cautioning against reading too much into the positive GDP figure.
Indeed, Dai-Ichi Life's Shinke said there's a risk inventory could shave off growth in the second quarter and keep any economic expansion modest.
DEFLATIONARY MINDSET
The data will be closely scrutinized at the BOJ's two-day rate review that ends on Friday. The central bank is widely expected to maintain its massive stimulus program and rosy assessment of the economy.
""The economy isn't falling off a cliff. It's recovering, so I don't see this data as piling pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease soon. It's just that the recovery isn't gathering pace,"" said Shinke of Dai-Ichi Life.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.4 percent. Capital spending also grew 0.4 percent, below an expected 0.8 percent gain but marking the first rise in four quarters.
The pick-up in business investment is seen as crucial to sparking sustained economic growth and inflation, so the latest numbers should come as some relief to policy-makers.
But the mixed signs from the data underscore a long-time dilemma for policymakers struggling to reflate the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation.
A deflationary mindset from years of falling prices has meant that companies and households remain reluctant to boost spending, even as the weak yen bolstered revenues and led to increase in job and wages.
Economics Minister Akira Amari said a clear end to deflation won't come unless companies start to take more risks and invest.
""It's important that corporate executives wipe off their deflationary mindset,"" he told reporters after the data, complaining that some weakness remained in capital expenditure.

""In terms of sentiment, Japan hasn't emerged from deflation yet.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts jumped to their highest level in nearly 7-1/2 years in April and building permits soared, hopeful signs for an economy that is struggling to regain strong momentum after a dismal first quarter. 
The strength in housing is in stark contrast with weakness in consumption, business spending and manufacturing, which has prompted economists to lower their second-quarter growth estimates and raised doubts that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of 2015.
""The stronger starts and permits data suggests that some real gauges of economic activity may finally be starting to accelerate during the spring, increasing optimism that the Fed may be on track to hike rates later this year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Groundbreaking surged 20.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.14 million units, the highest since November 2007, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The percent increase was the biggest since February 1991.
Adding to the report's strong tenor, March's starts were sharply revised higher. Groundbreaking for single-family homes, which accounts for the largest share of the market, hit its highest level since January 2008. Starts for the volatile multifamily segment also recorded hefty gains last month. 
While April's sharp acceleration in starts likely reflected pent-up demand during a harsh winter, a 10.1 percent jump in permits for future home construction to a near seven-year high 1.14 million-unit rate indicated the rebound was sustainable.
Home building is being boosted by solid gains in household formation as more young adults find employment and very tight housing inventories. Economists had forecast groundbreaking increasing to only a 1.02 million-unit pace and permits rising to just a 1.06 million-unit rate last month. 
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, advanced 1.7 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, gained 0.18 percent. 
The S&P homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> rose 0.86 percent and the housing index (HGX) climbed 0.80 percent, outperforming the broad market, which was held back by weak financial results from Walmart (N:WMT).
The world's largest retailer said its customers were using their tax refunds and savings at the pump to pay down debt rather than spend on discretionary items, confirming a trend flagged by U.S. retail sales data since December. 
HOUSING FIRMING
The firming housing market buoyed profits at  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD). The world's largest home improvement chain by sales reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, and raised its full-year sales and profit forecast on Tuesday.
The signs of strength in housing fit in with views a rebound is under way. There is cautious optimism that housing, which has seen an acceleration in home sales and prices, will combine with a tightening labor market to lift the economy out of the soft patch hit at the start of the year.
""The strong rebound in housing starts confirmed expectations for housing to accelerate substantially in the second quarter and be a stand-out growth contributor amid otherwise sluggish indications for a pickup in GDP growth,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.   
Based on April's starts data, economists lifted their second-quarter growth estimates by at least one-tenth of a percentage point to between a 1.7 percent and 2.7 percent annual pace.
The government reported last month that gross domestic product grew at a 0.2 percent rate in the first quarter. Weak March trade and inventories data, however, suggested the economy actually contracted. 
The government will publish GDP revisions next week. Output at the start of the year was dragged down by the harsh winter, a strong dollar, a ports labor dispute and deep energy spending cuts in the first quarter. 
Last month, groundbreaking vaulted 85.9 percent in the Northeast. There were also outsized gains in the Midwest and the West. Though starts fell 1.8 percent in the South, where most of the home building takes place, building permits were up 9.9 percent. 
Single-family homes groundbreaking gained 16.7 percent. Starts for the multi-family homes segment increased 27.2 percent. Single-family permits increased 3.7 percent last month. Multi-family permits surged 20.5 percent.

1288,By International Business Times,"<span>May 19, 2015 05:15AM ET</span>",UK Inflation Negative For First Time Since 1960,"By Reuters -

Britain's annual rate of consumer price inflation fell below zero for the first time since the 1960s, official figures showed on Tuesday, pushed down by lower travel costs due to an early Easter.
The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in April compared with the same month last year.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected the consumer price index to remain at zero.
It was the first time that the CPI came in negative since official records for the index began in 1996. Based on comparable estimates going back further, it was the first time that consumer prices showed deflation since 1960, the ONS said.
In monthly terms, prices rose 0.2 percent, the ONS said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last week that the central bank thought inflation could turn negative imminently, although he reiterated that prices would pick up in the coming months and interest rates were more likely to move up than down.
April's reading leaves inflation well below the BoE's 2 percent target, but for now few economists think Britain is at risk of Japanese-style entrenched price falls.
The wages of workers in Britain have picked up in recent months and figures due to be published on Thursday are expected show that retail sales rose by nearly 4 percent in April compared with the same month last year.
The CPI in April was pushed down by cheaper air and sea fares which the ONS linked to the Easter holidays -- when prices are usually higher -- which this year fell outside the collection period for the April reading of the index.
Last year, Easter fell in the middle of the collection period, meaning the higher fares pushed up the index.
The sharp fall in inflation around the world has been driven by the slump in global oil prices which took place last year, as well as falls in food prices.
The ONS said food prices had fallen about 3 percent in annual terms in each of the last four months, an unprecedented run of such large declines.
But an underlying measure of inflation, which strips out increases in energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell in April to its lowest yearly level since March 2001 at 0.8 percent.
Data also released by the ONS on Tuesday showed that factory gate prices fell by 1.7 percent in annual terms, a touch weaker than economists' predictions of a 1.6 percent fall.
House prices across Britain rose by 9.6 percent in the 12 months to March, picking up a bit of speed from an increase of 7.4 percent in February, the data showed.
Other measures of British house prices have also shown an acceleration in recent months after slowing for much of 2014.
Prices in London rose 11.2 percent, the ONS said."

1291,By Investing.com,"<span>May 18, 2015 09:51PM ET</span>","RBA minutes show Aussie level, federal spending key on rate views","Investing.com - The strong Australian dollar and federal spending plans are the key variables in assessing the case for a further rate cut from a record low 2%, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in the minutes of its May meeting that were released on Tuesday. Since the May meeting, Australia released a federal budget that leaned more toward spending control than stimulus.Below is the full-text statement.Members PresentGlenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaOthers PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsMembers noted that growth of Australia's major trading partners had eased a little in the early months of 2015, but was forecast to remain close to its long-run average in 2015 and 2016. Minor revisions to the outlook largely reflected weaker growth in China in the March quarter, which had also been reflected in lower bulk commodity prices and hence a slightly lower terms of trade than previously forecast by staff. Monetary conditions remained very accommodative across the globe and low oil prices were also supporting growth of Australia's trading partners. Core inflation rates were below central banks' targets in many economies.Economic growth in China had eased further in the March quarter across a broad range of indicators. The Chinese property market had continued to be a source of weakness in the economy and represented a key source of uncertainty for the outlook, both through the effects on demand for industrial products and on the finances of local governments that relied on land sales to fund infrastructure projects. Members noted that residential property prices had continued to fall, albeit at a more gradual pace, and sales were lower than in the previous year. Chinese demand for steel had eased and had been accompanied by a fall in Chinese iron ore production and relatively flat imports of iron ore, although Australian iron ore exports to China continued to grow. Members noted that the authorities had introduced several measures to address the overhang of housing supply, while the People's Bank of China (PBC) had lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks.Although the prices of iron ore, thermal coal and oil prices had rebounded somewhat from recent lows, members observed that the slowing in the growth of Chinese demand for steel had contributed to declines in the prices of bulk commodities since the start of 2015. As a result, the terms of trade had declined and were expected to continue doing so as lower spot prices gradually fed their way into contract prices for commodities, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Notwithstanding this, members noted that the forecast terms of trade were considerably higher than they had been prior to the mid 2000s.Growth in the US economy had moderated in the March quarter, largely reflecting the temporary effects of disruptions related to severe weather and industrial action in West Coast ports. Over the same period, conditions in the labour market had continued to improve. Non-farm payrolls employment had continued to grow strongly over the past six months and the unemployment rate had declined further. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had indicated that it was likely to begin the process of normalising interest rates in the second half of the year as long as economic conditions continued to evolve as expected.Growth in the Japanese economy looked to have been modest in the March quarter and there were signs that tight labour market conditions were generating stronger wage growth. In the rest of east Asia, growth of both exports and domestic activity appeared to have slowed a little in the March quarter. Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover gradually over past few months.Domestic Economic ConditionsMembers observed that the forces underpinning developments in the domestic economy were much as they had been for some time. The available data suggested that growth in the domestic economy had continued at a pace a bit below average in the March quarter. Members noted that growth was expected to continue at a similar pace over the coming year before picking up gradually to an above-average pace over the course of 2016/17.Household consumption growth had picked up late in 2014 and recent indicators were consistent with expectations that consumption would continue to rise gradually, supported by very low interest rates, relatively strong population growth and a gradual decline in the saving ratio. Members noted that if households respond to very low interest rates and higher asset prices to a similar degree as they had in the period prior to the global financial crisis, expected outcomes would include a lower saving ratio and higher consumption growth than embodied in the forecasts. Alternatively, if households were less inclined to bring forward their consumption than had been factored into the forecasts, perhaps to limit the increase in their leverage, consumption growth would be likely to be weaker and the saving ratio higher than forecast.Conditions in the established housing market had remained strong in Sydney and Melbourne. However, across the rest of the country, which accounts for around 60 per cent of Australia's dwelling stock, housing price growth had declined. The available data suggested that dwelling investment had grown strongly in the March quarter, supported by low interest rates and above-average population growth. Forward-looking indicators, including residential building and loan approvals, suggested that dwelling investment would continue to grow strongly in the next few quarters. Members noted that growth of housing credit for both owner-occupiers and investors had remained relatively stable in recent months, with overall credit growth broadly in line with longer-term income growth.Survey data had suggested that business conditions in the non-mining sector were around average and that business credit had picked up of late. However, forward-looking measures of business confidence had remained a little below average and non-residential building approvals had also been running at a relatively low level. Members noted that non-mining business investment was expected to recover later than had been thought at the time the forecasts for the February Statement on Monetary Policy had been prepared. This reassessment was consistent with the weak reading on investment intentions for 2015/16 from the December quarter ABS capital expenditure survey as well as business liaison by the Bank, which had suggested for some time that businesses would commit to increasing investment only after observing a durable improvement in the growth of demand. Members noted that exchange rate developments were also likely to remain important for investment decisions. Uncertainty about both the timing and speed of the recovery in non-mining business investment remained key risks to the forecasts. Mining investment was still expected to decline sharply, but the speed of that decline continued to be uncertain.Resource export volumes had grown strongly in the March quarter, in part reflecting the absence of substantial weather-related disruptions across the country. Resource exports were expected to continue making a strong contribution to growth as new production, particularly of LNG, came on line over 2015. Members noted that the capacity to maintain production plans in the face of lower commodity prices had been enhanced by further cost-cutting by producers, and that this had been assisted by the decline in the price of oil (an input into production) over the past year.Fiscal consolidation by the federal and state governments was expected to contribute to subdued growth of domestic demand over the forecast period. Members noted that the Commonwealth Budget, which would be announced the following week, would provide important information for updating these forecasts.The most recent labour force data indicated that employment growth had been increasing over the past six months or more, to be a little above the rate of population growth. Members noted that the revised labour force data also indicated that the unemployment rate had been stable through most of this period at about 6¼ per cent, and observed that the extended period of slow wage growth may help to reconcile these data with the below-trend growth in the economy over 2014. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand had continued to point to modest growth of employment over coming months.Members noted that the delayed pick-up in GDP growth in the revised outlook meant that the unemployment rate was forecast to rise further, before starting to decline gradually towards the end of the forecast period. Wage growth was not expected to increase from current low levels for some time. Members discussed the possibility that employment growth could grow fast enough such that the unemployment rate did not increase, especially if there was ongoing moderation in wage growth.Inflation in the March quarter had been broadly as expected. CPI inflation had slowed over the past year, reflecting the large falls in fuel prices and repeal of the carbon price. Underlying inflation had remained around ½–¾ per cent in the quarter and 2¼–2½ per cent over the past year. Domestic inflationary pressures – as indicated by non-tradables inflation – had remained below average, consistent with the extended period of slower wage growth. Inflation in consumer prices related to housing was marginally above its historical average, driven by inflation in new dwelling costs reflecting the strength of the housing market. Tradables inflation (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had picked up in response to the depreciation of the Australian dollar over the past year or so.Members noted that the inflation forecast had been revised down slightly since February, reflecting the expectation that growth of economic activity would remain below trend for a little longer than previously forecast. Domestic labour cost pressures were expected to remain well contained and underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the inflation target over the forecast period. Headline inflation was forecast to remain below 2 per cent in year-ended terms through to mid 2015, before picking up to be consistent with the inflation target thereafter.Financial MarketsThe Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with the unusual trading in the Australian dollar in the period immediately prior to the announcement of the Board's decisions in February, March and April. Members were briefed on the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's preliminary finding, which had been announced the previous day, that each of those moves in the Australian dollar had been a result of ‘normal market operations in an environment of lower liquidity immediately ahead of the RBA announcement’.Members observed that financial markets continued to focus on the situation in Greece and monetary policy developments in the major economies.Negotiations between the Greek Government and its official sector creditors remained at an impasse. Greece appeared to have sufficient funds to meet its scheduled payments in May only after the introduction of further stopgap measures. The next Eurogroup meeting was scheduled for 11 May and at least partial agreement would be needed on Greece's reform agenda before further assistance funds were released. Overall, Greek banks' reliance on emergency liquidity assistance had increased significantly recently and total Eurosystem lending to Greek banks now exceeded one-quarter of their total liabilities.Members noted that the apparent deadlock in Greece had had little impact on broader financial markets until recently, when spreads on the debt of other euro area periphery countries – including Portugal and Spain – had increased as concerns surrounding Greek finances continued to rise.In contrast, yields on German and other highly rated European sovereign debt fell to new lows in April following the continued expansion of the European Central Bank's balance sheet, with the 10-year Bund yield declining to 8 basis points. In recent days, however, there had been a marked retracement, with 10 year yields rising by more than 30 basis points in Germany and the United States.In the United States, market pricing continued to suggest that the first increase in the US policy rate could be closer to the end of the year, and the subsequent pace of policy tightening could be slower than that envisaged by members of the FOMC as published in mid March.In China, the PBC had taken steps to boost liquidity by reducing the reserve requirement ratio. This step had partly sought to offset the reduction in liquidity resulting from sales of foreign reserves by the PBC in recent months. Equity prices had continued to record particularly large rises in mainland China, leading to prices more than doubling since mid 2014. Members noted that the rally in the Chinese share market had coincided with rapid growth in retail financial investments funded by debt, which raised concerns about the sustainability of the rise in share prices and the potential effects of any decline.The appreciation of the US dollar since mid 2014 had continued its modest reversal over the past month, resulting in a depreciation of the US dollar against most currencies. Reflecting that, together with recent domestic data, the Australian dollar had appreciated by 3 per cent against the US dollar and by 2½ per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month. Nevertheless, compared with its level in mid 2014, the Australian dollar remained around 17 per cent lower against the US dollar and around 10 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis. In contrast, the Chinese renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar over the past month and in trade-weighted terms remained around 12 per cent above its level in mid 2014.Members noted that equity prices in the major developed economy markets had risen during April, with the exception of Europe, where equity prices fell a little after large rises earlier in the year. In Australia, equity prices also recorded a small decline in April, although the resources sector had outperformed, with energy sector share prices rising following an increase in the oil price.Corporate bond issuance by Australian entities remained robust in both domestic and international markets amid favourable pricing conditions. In the money market, pricing on money market instruments pointed to around an 80 per cent chance of a reduction in the cash rate target at the present meeting.Considerations for Monetary PolicyMembers assessed that the outlook for global economic growth had been revised only marginally lower in the near term and would continue to be supported by stimulatory monetary policies and the low price of oil. They noted that growth appeared to have slowed in China and that the weakness in the Chinese property market continued to represent a significant risk both for Chinese growth and demand for construction-related commodities. Lower growth in the demand for commodities had contributed to the lower prices of Australia's key commodity exports since the beginning of the year. As a result, Australia's terms of trade were expected to decline a little more than was forecast three months ago.In their discussion of the appropriate course for monetary policy, members noted the revised staff forecasts for the domestic economy. Although the recent flow of data had been generally positive, there had also been indications that future capital spending in both the mining and non-mining sectors would be weaker than expected. Overall, compared with the previous set of forecasts, growth was now expected to take longer to strengthen and the unemployment rate was likely to remain elevated for longer. This change, and generally subdued growth of domestic costs, including wages, implied that inflation was expected to be slightly lower than in earlier forecasts though still consistent with the target. On the face of it, this meant that it would be appropriate to consider an easing of monetary policy.Members also discussed the potential risk that low levels of interest rates could foster imbalances in the housing market. While concerned about the very strong pace of growth of housing prices in Sydney, and observing that conditions in Melbourne were strong, members saw much more muted trends in other capital cities. As at previous meetings, they acknowledged the risks that could accompany a sustained increase in leverage from already high levels, should that occur, and that the expansionary effects of lower interest rates could be less than in the past. On the data available for this meeting, however, it did not appear that the growth of housing credit, either for investment or owner-occupancy purposes, had been increasing over recent months. The Bank would continue to work with other regulators to assess and contain the risks arising from the housing market.More broadly, members noted that the low levels of interest rates were helping to support demand in the face of a number of persistent headwinds and that a further reduction in the cash rate would provide some additional support to economic activity by reinforcing recent encouraging trends in household demand. In turn, this would support non-mining business investment insofar as demand conditions were the main factor constraining these decisions. Such outcomes would be expected ultimately to lead to stronger labour market conditions. Members also noted that further depreciation of the exchange rate seemed to be both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices, and that such an outcome would help to achieve more balanced growth in the economy and assist with the transition to a lower terms of trade.Members discussed the timing of any interest rate adjustment. They could see cases both for moving at this meeting or at the subsequent meeting. The latter course would bring the advantage of additional information on the economy, including details of the forthcoming Commonwealth Budget. On the other hand, with the revised staff forecasts scheduled to be released a few days after the meeting, members acknowledged that the challenges of communication might be more effectively met with a reduction in the cash rate at this meeting.On balance, taking all these factors into account, the Board decided that the best course was to ease monetary policy further at this meeting. Members agreed that, as at the time of the reduction in the cash rate in February, the statement communicating the decision would not contain any guidance on the future path of monetary policy. Members did not see this as limiting the Board's scope for any action that might be appropriate at future meetings.The DecisionThe Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.0 per cent, effective 6 May.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's new home prices fell for the eighth consecutive month in April from a year earlier but were flat from March, adding to hopes that a property downturn which is weighing heavily on the economy is beginning to bottom out.
But analysts warned any recovery in the market will take some time given a huge inventory of unsold homes, and said the property sector remains the biggest risk to the world's second-largest economy, which looks set for its worst year in 25 years.
That will keep pressure on policymakers to roll out more interest rate cuts and other stimulus measures later this year to boost activity.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities dropped 6.1 percent last month from a year ago, the same rate of decline as in March, according to Reuters calculations based on official data published on Monday. But nationwide prices steadied from March, further narrowing from a 0.1 percent fall in the previous month.
Beijing saw prices rise, albeit modestly, for the second month in a row, while those in Shanghai rose for the first time in 12 months. But prices in many smaller cities, which account for around 60 percent of national sales, continued to fall.
""We expect home sales to see year-on-year growth in the second half of the year, and home prices in third- and fourth-tier cities to also bottom out in the second half,"" said Nomura chief China economist Zhao Yang.
""But the big impact for the overall economy is from property investment, where I don't expect a quick rebound in growth...that's why we forecast China will miss its 7 percent target (for 2015).""
Zhao said real estate investment, which comprises around 20 percent of China's GDP, may grow less than 5 percent this year, compared with 10.5 percent in 2014, knocking 1 percentage point off economic growth.
Data last week showed home sales measured by floor area rebounded 7.7 percent in April from a year ago, the first growth since November 2013.
But real estate investment growth continued to slow in the first four months of 2015 to the lowest since May 2009 as new construction slumped, impacting demand for everything from steel and cement to appliances and furniture.
Still, government measures seem to be slowing enticing some buyers back into the market. Mortgages rose 2.1 percent in Janaury-April from the same period a year earlier.
China relaxed tax rules and downpayment requirements on second homes in late March. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates for the third time since November to lower companies' borrowing costs and stimulate loan demand.
""The price data are signaling an obvious bottoming out,"" said Gavekal Dragonomics economist Rosealea Yao in Beijing, adding the secondary market was leading with a 1.1 percent annualized monthly rebound.
The National Bureau of Statistics data showed new home prices in Beijing rose 0.7 percent in April from March, improving from a 0.3 percent rise in March from February, while Shanghai prices were up 0.6 percent after being flat in the previous month.
Liu Jianwei, senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said in a statement that prices are still polarized between first and lower-tier cities, with an average 1 percent monthly rise in the first-tier and 0.1 percent fall and 0.3 percent fall in the second and third-tier, respectively.

Of the 70 major cities the NBS monitors, 48 posted a monthly decline, down from March's 50.

In January-March, core orders rose 6.3 percent from the prior three months.

Compared with a year earlier, core orders in March rose 2.6 percent, versus a 7.2 percent decline forecast by economists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell for a fifth straight month in April due in part to a further decline in oil and gas drilling, suggesting that the economy is growing at only a modest pace in the second quarter.
The economy's struggle to pick up steam after a dismal first quarter was underscored by other data on Friday showing a drop in consumer confidence to a seven-month low in early May and only a mild rebound in factory activity in New York state.
Coming on the heels of weak retail sales and producer inflation data this week, the reports suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon.
""It means in the next month or so we are unlikely to see a massive rebound in growth momentum. These are not the numbers that would inspire confidence in the Fed to tighten policy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Industrial output slipped 0.3 percent after a similar decline in March, the Fed said. Economists had expected a 0.1 percent gain.
A plunge of 14.5 percent in oil and gas well drilling pushed mining production down 0.8 percent last month. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in mining output.
Crude oil prices have fallen by about 50 percent since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity.
Companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB), the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton (N:HAL) have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year.  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) has cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned that lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.
Oil and gas drilling is down 46.5 percent over the year and there is no relief in sight despite the recent stabilization of crude oil prices. Oil rig counts continued to decline early in the second quarter.
""We see a further drop in mining investment over the next few quarters and are not convinced that business investment ex-mining will be strong enough to sufficiently offset this drag,"" said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
SENTIMENT SOURS
In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 88.6 early this month, the lowest reading since October, from 95.9 in April.
There were slight declines in consumers' attitudes toward purchases of motor vehicles and homes.
While economists noted the weak relationship between consumer confidence and consumer spending, they nevertheless saw May's decline as unfavorable. Many of them believe that consumer spending will accelerate in the second quarter as households start drawing on their savings from relatively cheap gasoline prices.
""All things considered, the decline in confidence means that the potential for a pick-up in consumption growth over the next few months is probably smaller than we previously anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The economy was slammed earlier in the year by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms. The government reported last month that GDP expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter.
But trade and inventory data published after the GDP snapshot suggested the economy actually contracted. Second-quarter growth estimates are currently hovering around a 2.5 percent pace, well below the 4.6 percent pace in the same period last year.
U.S. stocks were marginally weaker, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
Last month, utilities production tumbled 1.3 percent, also contributing to the weakness in industrial output. Manufacturing production was unchanged after gaining 0.3 percent in March. It
was restrained by a 0.9 percent drop in machinery, though motor vehicle production rose.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been dampened by the dollar. Even as the greenback rally fades, factory activity is unlikely to rebound strongly.
In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 3.09 in May from -1.19 in April. A reading above zero indicates expansion.
While new orders rebounded this month, order books remained depressed and inventories swelled. Labor market indicators also weakened a bit.

""They suggest any pick-up in manufacturing activity will be muted, at best,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.

Economists see the economy growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the current quarter, according to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of 44 forecasters, released on Friday. In last quarter's survey, released in February, growth for this quarter was forecast at 3.0 percent.
Third-quarter 2015 growth was forecast at 3.1 percent, up from an estimate of 2.8 percent in February's survey, though full-year growth for 2015 was forecast at 2.4 percent, down from the previous estimate of 3.2 percent.
The pace of hiring was expected to decelerate in the current quarter compared with previous expectations, with an average rate of monthly nonfarm job growth seen around 195,300 versus a previous forecast of 233,800. For the third quarter, job growth is expected to average 223,300, a touch higher than the prior forecast of 222,000.
Hiring should average 243,900 a month for all of 2015, compared with the prior full-year forecast of 252,500.
The jobless rate was expected to be 5.4 percent at the end of the current quarter and 5.3 percent by the end of the third quarter. The February survey had forecast a rate of 5.5 percent by the end of the current quarter.

The most recent official unemployment rate released by the government showed the jobless rate in April at 5.4 percent.

Industrial output slipped 0.3 percent after a revised 0.3 percent drop in March, the Federal Reserve said on Friday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production edging up 0.1 percent last month after a previously reported 0.6 percent fall in March, which was the biggest drop since August 2012.
The dour report added to weak retail sales data in suggesting that the economy was struggling to regain momentum after growth slowed abruptly in the first quarter.
Mining production fell 0.8 percent as oil and gas well drilling plunged 14.5 percent. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in mining output. Utilities production tumbled 1.3 percent, likely as warmer weather reduced demand for heating.
Manufacturing output was unchanged after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March.
Industrial capacity use fell to 78.2 percent, the lowest since January of last year, from 78.6 percent in March.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2015 11:56AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; inflation still muted,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to near a 15-year low, indicating the jobs market was on solid footing even as the economy struggles to regain momentum after abruptly slowing in the first quarter.
Despite the tightening labor market, a strong dollar and lower oil prices are keeping inflation under wraps. That trend along with signs of modest economic growth early in the second quarter would suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates until later in the year.
""The labor market is doing well ... inflation is not going anywhere fast. There is no urgency for the Fed to start normalizing monetary policy, they will likely wait until September,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 264,000 for the week ended May 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday, within a whisker of a 15-year low reached two weeks ago. 
Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strengthening labor market, for 10 straight weeks. Economists had forecast claims rising to 275,000.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since April 2000. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher on the data. Prices for U.S. government debt also rose, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. 
The economy barely grew in the first quarter, held back by a range of factors, including the dollar, bad weather and port disruptions. Retail sales and manufacturing data suggest that the pace of activity, while picking up, remains modest.
POLICY DILEMMA
The dollar has gained about 11 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners since June. The claims data, which economists said was consistent with monthly job gains in excess of 200,000, underscored the Fed's dilemma.
Policymakers believe the economy is poised to strengthen and the labor market appears to be tightening, but surprisingly soft growth and subdued inflation pressures are complicating their plans to lift rates.
The U.S. central bank, which has a 2 percent inflation target, has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand fell 0.4 percent last month as the cost of energy products and food declined. 
It was the third time this year that the PPI dropped and followed a 0.2 percent increase in March. 
Producer prices also were weighed down by declining profit margins at retailers and wholesalers. In the 12 months through April, producer prices fell 1.3 percent, the biggest year-on-year decline since 2010, after declining 0.8 percent in March. 
""Despite an even tightening labor market, inflation is totally under control, complicating the Fed's decision-making,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed must keep its finger on the trigger, even if it doesn't have to pull it just yet.""  
Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2 percent last month and falling 0.8 percent from a year ago.
A drop of 0.7 percent in the index for final demand goods accounted for more than 70 percent of the decline in the PPI last month. Energy prices fell 2.9 percent after rising 1.5 percent in March. Food prices fell for a fifth straight month. 
Last month, the volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.2 percent in the prior month.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services ticked up 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in March.
While the weakness in the PPI is unlikely to be fully reflected in next week's consumer inflation data, as the relationship between the two has weakened, economists said the very benign inflation environment would persist for a while.

""The continued weakness in both import and producer prices suggest that pipeline inflationary pressures remain quite weak,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales were flat in April as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and other big-ticket items, the latest sign the economy was struggling to rebound strongly after barely growing in the first quarter. 
The weaker-than-expected retail sales report from the Commerce Department, and other data on Wednesday showing the 10th straight month of declining import prices in April, suggest little urgency for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates.
""Hopes for a strong rebound are now fading. The likelihood of a near-term Fed action is almost zero now,"" said Thomas Costerg, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LONDON:STAN) Bank in New York.
While March's retail sales were revised higher to show a 1.1 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.9 percent rise, that was not enough to offset the general weak tone of the report. Economists had forecast sales up 0.2 percent in April.
Futures markets continued to show that traders do not expect an interest rate hike until December at the earliest. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt slipped. U.S. stocks were little changed.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were also unchanged after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in March.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.5 percent in April after a previously reported 0.4 percent increase in March. 
Retail sales have trended weaker despite households getting a massive windfall from lower gasoline prices. Consumers appear to have saved much of the money from the cheaper gasoline.
The retail sales data added to employment and manufacturing reports in suggesting that while the economy was regaining its footing at the start of the second quarter, it lacked enough vigor to convince the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon.
The economy was walloped earlier in the year by a mix of bad weather, disruptions at ports, the strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms.
SILVER LINING?
While the continued weakness challenges the notion that sales had been depressed by the weather and a lack of inventory during a labor dispute at the West Coast ports, economists are optimistic of a pick-up given that personal savings are at two- year highs and consumer confidence remains robust.
""We remain puzzled by the softness in retail sales given the gains in employment, real incomes from lower energy prices, and wealth, but we continue to look for consumer spending to pick up this year,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The weak retail sales trajectory was underscored by Macy's Inc, one of the largest U.S. department store retailers, which reported a 13.8 percent drop in first-quarter net income, blamed on the weather, the port disruptions and the dollar. 
The company, which operates more than 850 stores throughout the United States and U.S. territories, said tourist spending at Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores were down sharply. It said second-quarter earnings were expected to fall short of the same period a year ago.
Several other major retailers will report results in the next few days, including Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl's and JC Penney, which will release its earnings after the close of trading Wednesday. 
The government reported last month that GDP expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter.
Trade and wholesale inventory data published last week, however, suggested the economy actually contracted. That was corroborated by a third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, showing business inventories barely rose in March.
Economists estimate the economy shrank at a 0.8 percent pace. The government will release its GDP revision later this month.
The case for the Fed to delay hiking interest rates was strengthened by a separate report from the Labor Department showing import prices fell 0.3 percent in April after slipping 0.2 percent in March.
The dollar, which has gained about 11 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June, and lower crude oil prices are keeping a lid on price pressures. That has left inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
""The dollar may have stabilized, but until it falls, the downward pressure emanating from lower import costs will limit domestic firm pricing power,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Last month, retail sales were curbed by declines in receipts at auto dealerships, service stations, furniture and electronic and appliance stores.
There were some pockets of strength, with sales of clothing, sporting goods and building materials and garden equipment rising. Receipts at online stores rose as did those at restaurants and bars.

Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, ticked up 0.1 percent in March. That was well below the 0.8 percent gain the government assumed in its advance estimate of first-quarter growth published last month.
That was the latest suggestion that first-quarter GDP growth could be revised down from the scant 0.2 percent annual pace reported in April to show a contraction. Trade, wholesale and manufacturing inventory data published last week also came in weaker than the government's assumptions in the GDP snapshot.

Retail inventories, excluding autos, rose 0.5 percent in February.
In March, business sales increased 0.4 percent, the largest rise since last July, after falling 0.2 percent in February.

That has left inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Persistently low inflation gives the U.S. central bank ample room to keep its ultra-low interest rate policy a while longer, while it looks for strong signals of the economy's recovery after it weakened sharply in the first quarter.
The Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Last month, imported petroleum prices rose 1.0 percent after increasing 1.6 percent in March.
Import prices excluding petroleum fell 0.4 percent in April after a similar decline in March. Imported food prices slipped 0.9 percent after dropping 0.7 percent in March.

The report also showed export prices declined 0.7 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in March. Export prices fell 6.3 percent in the 12 months through April.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2015 07:33AM ET</span>",Euro zone economy picks up pace but Germany lags,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A slowdown in Germany weighed on the euro zone in the first quarter, but the bloc's economy still grew at its fastest in almost two years as cheap food and fuel boosted spending and a central bank stimulus program kicked in.
Gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter for a 1.0 percent year-on-year rise - just below forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
European Union statistics office Eurostat gave no detailed breakdown with Wednesday's data, while economists said growth was likely to have been helped by lower food and energy prices, a weak euro and the asset-buying program the European Central Bank started in early March.
""It is evident that improved growth was due to strengthened domestic demand. Domestic demand was certainly behind the improved growth in France and Italy, and it also reportedly held up reasonably well in Germany,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
GERMANY DISAPPOINTS, FRANCE OUTPERFORMS
Overall, however, growth in Europe's largest, and traditionally export-led, economy Germany slowed more than expected as imports rose more sharply than sales abroad.
That net drag from trade activity was replicated across the bloc as muted global growth curbed export growth despite a weaker euro, Archer said.
Germany's GDP grew 0.3 percent on the quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous three months and undershooting a consensus forecast of 0.5 percent in a Reuters poll.
""Weak global trade is hitting German industry ... and if the consumers start refraining from spending too, overall economic growth will decline rapidly,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank.
The growth rate was half that of neighboring France, the bloc's No.2 economy, which expanded by 0.6 percent, its strongest rate in two years, boosted by a 0.8 percent rise in consumer spending.
Finance Minister Michel Sapin said the French economy would now grow faster than the 1 percent the government had forecast for 2015.
Archer said it was likely that consumer spending was a significant growth driver across the region and that investment strengthened in a number of countries, helped by improved business confidence.
Higher inventories were also likely to have contributed to growth.
STEADY ACCELERATION
Quarterly growth in the euro zone was the strongest since the second quarter of 2013 and marked a steady acceleration over the growth rates of 2014.
Marco Valli, chief euro zone economist at UniCredit, said the same pace of growth should be maintained in the current quarter as waning support from oil prices should be compensated by a stronger impact from the weak euro.
""We think the euro zone has reached cruising speed of 1.5-2.0 percent annualized (growth), with favorable developments in oil prices and the exchange rate more than offsetting ongoing weakness in global trade,"" he said.
Economists said the faster euro zone growth and an end to a run of negative inflation numbers in April were unlikely to stop the ECB's money printing program.
The central bank, which aims to lift euro zone inflation expectations back to its target rate of just below 2 percent, has repeatedly said it has no plans to end the quantitative easing scheme before its scheduled conclusion in September 2016.

The euro zone's third biggest economy Italy grew 0.3 percent quarter on quarter, slightly more than expected thanks to a pick-up in domestic demand, fuelling hopes of a recovery this year after three years of recession.

1344,By International Business Times,"<span>May 13, 2015 07:30AM ET</span>",Bank Of England Cuts Growth Outlook For Next 3 Years ,"By Reuters -

The Bank of England cut its forecasts for British economic growth over the next three years on Wednesday and cautiously backed market expectations that it will only start to raise interest rates in around a year's time.
The central bank now expects economic growth this year of 2.4 percent, it said in its quarterly Inflation Report, down from a 2.9 percent projection in February and closer to most other economic forecasters' expectations.
Britain was the fastest growing of any major advanced economy last year, as it made up ground lost during the financial crisis.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said inflation was likely to pick up later this year.
""Although it could temporarily turn negative in the near term, inflation is expected to pick up notably towards the end of the year as past falls in prices drop out of the annual comparison,"" he said, speaking a press conference.
""The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) expects the past falls in commodity prices to be relatively short-lived and will therefore look through them in setting policy,"" he said.
Sterling fell to a day's low against the dollar and British government bond futures jumped higher, before retreating, as Carney spoke.
Economic growth slowed at the start of 2015 and Prime Minister David Cameron's newly elected Conservative government faces a major challenge to set it on a more sustainable path.
The Bank said its growth downgrade was due to the fact that interest rates were likely to increase faster than markets had expected three months ago, as well as due to a stronger currency and a weaker outlook for house building and productivity.
After saying in April that the pace of rate rises priced in by markets was unusually slow, policymakers now appear more happy with what markets have priced in since.
""A path that implied only gradual rises in Bank Rate over the next few years, broadly in line with the current market path, remained consistent with absorbing slack and returning inflation to the target within two years,"" the Bank said.
The Bank's forecasts are based on market pricing for interest rates to rise from their record-low 0.5 percent in the second quarter of next year -- three months earlier than expected in February -- and to average 0.9 percent in the last three months of 2016. The Bank has kept interest rates unchanged for more than six years.
However, policymakers said they were still concerned about the very limited increase in global interest rates priced in by bond markets in the longer term.
Global bond yields have increased sharply since the MPC's May 8 meeting, as investors respond to rising oil prices and the increasing likelihood of U.S. interest rates rising.
The Bank said that it expected British inflation, which currently stands at a record-low zero percent, to return to its 2 percent target in two years' time, little changed from its forecast three months ago.
But as well as cutting 2015's growth forecast, it also lowered projections for 2016 and 2017 to 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
""Growth is forecast to be at or a little below its historical average rate throughout the forecast period,"" the Bank said. Growth could be slower due to increased risks of economic problems coming from Greece, it added.
The central bank also cut its forecast for wages, saying they will have risen 2.5 percent by the end of this year compared with an earlier forecast of 3.5 percent growth, before wage growth picks up to 4 percent next year."

Cheap oil and a weak euro lifted the French economy in the first quarter to growth of 0.6 percent, its fastest rate in two years and easily beating analysts' expectations.
The strong quarter-on-quarter data was supported by consumer spending, corporate investment, industrial output and inventories, while exports slowed.
It was the highest growth reading for the French economy since the second quarter of 2013 and was twice as high as that in Britain and Germany, which both reported a slowdown in the rate of output growth.
""The sharp acceleration in activity during the first quarter ...points to growth in 2015 being somewhat stronger than the 1.0 percent expected by the government,"" IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro said.
""However, we still do not estimate that the recovery will be strong enough to make a significant dent into France’s high unemployment rate"".
The jobless rate was 10.4 percent at the end of last year.
President Francois Hollande will be hoping the improving outlook boosts his record-low approval ratings. He has said he would not run for a second mandate in 2017 if unemployment has not dropped.
The government has forecast the economy would grow by at least 1 percent this year after eking out only 0.2 percent growth last year, a figure statistics office INSEE revised down on Wednesday from a previous 0.4 percent estimate.
It revised the 2014 debt-to-GDP rate to 95.6 percent of GDP from a previous 95.0 estimate while the 2014 public deficit was confirmed at 4.0 percent.
INSEE also revised the 2013 growth rate to 0.7 percent from 0.4 percent and the 2012 rate to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent.
The European Commission has forecast that the French economy will grow by 1.1 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2016.
Business investment stood at its highest level in the first quarter of this year since the second quarter of 2008. Household investment, however, contracted for the seventh straight quarter, showing that real estate remains a drag on the economy.
Supporting the improved outlook, an INSEE survey of industrial managers released last week showed they expected to increase investment 7 percent this year, the most since 2011.
Consumer confidence is at its highest in more than five years, although concerns about unemployment mean it is still below the long-term average.

British retail spending saw its biggest annual fall in four years last month, hurt by the early date of Easter holidays, though the industry body which commissioned the research said underlying growth was robust.
The British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday that total retail sales dropped by 1.3 percent in value terms, following a 4.7 percent surge in March when Easter shopping lifted the BRC's figures, which are not seasonally adjusted.
Other surveys have pointed to strong consumer morale, with inflation at zero and wage growth showing signs of gradual improvement after years of effective stagnation.
April's fall was the biggest since March 2011, but the BRC said its measure of average sales growth between February and April pointed to the strongest underlying rise in spending since June last year.
""(That's) a clear indication that confidence among consumers is slowly improving,"" said Helen Dickinson, director-general at the BRC.
On a so-called like-for-like basis -- a measure which strips out changes in floor space and is favored by equity analysts -- retail spending was 2.4 percent down in April compared with a 3.2 percent annual rise in March. March 2011
A separate survey from released by credit card company Barclaycard on Tuesday pointed to confidence among British shoppers, as its measure of consumer spending rose 4.5 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase since records began in October 2011.
""Weather and favorable economic conditions ... have culminated in a bumper month for consumer spending in April,"" said Chris Wood, managing director at Barclaycard.

Economists inside and outside the government believe Chinese interest rates are structurally too high and ill-matched to current economic conditions and should be brought lower. The central bank said in an accompanying statement Sunday that it will ""continue to promote real interest rates back towards reasonable levels"". The tone of the bank's comments is more aggressive than those of previous policy moves and suggests that the government's appetite for these kinds of adjustments will grow so long as China's low inflation/deflationary environment persists.""Our economy is still facing relatively big downward pressure. At the same time, domestic prices remain at low levels and real interest rates are still higher than historical average levels, providing room for continuous use of interest rate tools,"" the bank said.The PBOC also raised the ceiling on deposit rates to 1.5 times the benchmark from 1.3 times, continuing its recent pattern of accompanying policy rate adjustments with reform of China's interest rate regime. It said that financial institutions aren't expected to jack up deposit rates to the newly-adjusted ceiling but will be policing the banking system and regulate those participants which ""disturb the market order.""Sunday's announcement follows yet another weak trade report as well as price data suggesting that inflation remained uncomfortably low in April, despite a rebound in oil prices."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, signs of a pick-up in economic momentum that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to hike interest rates this year.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 223,000 as gains in services sector and construction jobs offset weakness in mining, the Labor Department said on Friday. The one-tenth of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level since May 2008 came even as more people piled into the labor market.
While the report suggested underlying strength in the economy at the start of the second quarter after a bad stumble, wage growth was tepid and March payrolls were revised downward, leading financial markets to push back rate hike bets.
""We see this report as reducing concerns that weak first-quarter growth represents a loss of economic momentum,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
Nevertheless, he said the bounce back was not strong enough to think the Fed could bump rates higher before September. 
March payrolls were revised to show only 85,000 jobs created, the fewest since June 2012. That resulted in 39,000 fewer jobs added in February and March than previously reported, underscoring the weakness in activity at the start of the year.
Investors on Wall Street cheered the report, with major stock indexes rising more than 1 percent.
Yields on U.S. Treasury debt slipped and futures contracts showed traders clinging to bets the U.S. central bank would raise rates from near zero this year. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
The drop in the unemployment rate pushed it within a whisker or two of the 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
Some economists said the tightening labor market could push Fed officials to tighten monetary policy despite anemic wage growth.
""Even without wages or inflation picking up, we do not think the Fed will feel comfortable sitting at zero as the unemployment rate closes in on 5 percent,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.Also encouraging, the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose 0.1 percentage point to 62.8 percent, although that was just up from a 36-year low.
Other measures on the Fed's so-called dashboard also improved further.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell to 10.8 percent - the lowest level since August 2008.
In addition, the number of long-term unemployed continued to fall.
Wages, however, were a weak spot. Average hourly earnings rose just three cents in April. While that took the year-on-year gain to 2.2 percent, it remained stuck in the range it has been in for the past few years.
The weakness in average hourly earnings is in stark contrast with other compensation measures that have suggested solid wage growth in recent months.
""With the unemployment rate approaching full-employment levels it will only be a matter of time before wages start to rise at a somewhat swifter pace,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Last month, the government reported that the economy expanded at only a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, but data earlier this week showing a wider-than-forecast trade deficit suggests GDP actually shrank.
There was a broad-based acceleration in job growth in April, with the exception of the mining sector, where a plunge in crude oil prices has undercut energy production.
Schlumberger (N:SLB), the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, said last month it would cut a further 11,000 jobs, bringing total layoffs this year to 20,000.  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) and Halliburton (N:HAL) have also announced thousands of redundancies.
Mining payrolls fell 15,000, logging the fourth straight month of declines. Manufacturing employment increased 1,000 after being flat in March as factories struggle with a strong dollar. Construction payrolls jumped 45,000 after falling 9,000 in March.
Private services employment rose 182,000 and government payrolls increased 10,000.

1387,By International Business Times,"<span>May 08, 2015 09:00AM ET</span>",The US Job Market Rebounds In April,"By Jessica Menton -

U.S. employers added 223,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.4 percent, the Labor Department said Friday, as the economy rebounded following a sharp hiring downturn in March. The report was expected to show that employers added 224,000 jobs in April, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
The U.S. economy had added far fewer jobs in March, marking the weakest pace of job growth since 2013. The U.S. had previously added at least 200,000 jobs per month for 12 consecutive months, a feat not seen in 20 years.
Despite a stronger-than-expected April Jobs report, market analysts pushed out expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June as a result of March’s disappointing data. A weak March jobs report, coupled with the disappointing first-quarter gross domestic product report, suggests the Fed will likely wait to raise rates until after its June meeting. The central bank met last week and kept interest rates at historic lows.
“It’s highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will announce raising rates at their June meeting,” said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief at Bankrate.com. “But with that said, the policy members would really like to get at least one rate increase, or two, under their collective belts this year, just so they can have that silver bullet in the gun in case things really fell out of bed and have the ammunition for a rate cut,” said Hamrick.
“Right now, their only other option is to go back to quantitative easing, and they would have strong distaste for having to go back down that route again,” said Hamrick.
What’s hidden below the data is a prime indicator that the government isn’t talking about--the extent to which good jobs are being lost, says Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University, as the U.S. economy may be seeing the end of good manufacturing jobs being replaced by the less secure, less lucrative service jobs.
America's manufacturing sector lost 1,000 jobs in March, the Department of Labor said in April, continuing a decades-long slide. Manufacturing accounts for roughly 8 percent of U.S. jobs today, down from about a third of all jobs in the early 1970s.
“Essentially, all we’re doing is creating a generation of 50-year-old hamburger flippers, and that’s very bad news,” Chaison. The good manufacturing jobs that helped Americans enter the middle class are increasingly becoming a thing of the past. “If anything, it’s becoming a historical artifact,” Chaison said.
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month, at 2.5 million, or 29 percent of the unemployed. The average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose by 3 cents to $24.87. For most workers, however, real wages have fallen or remained flat for more than three decades.
The healthy jobs growth in the economy won't matter to a significant portion of Americans. For most workers, real wages have fallen or remained flat since the 1970s. Many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full time, and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest portion opting out of work since the 1970s. The labor-force participation rate was little changed at 62.8 percent."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly fell 6.4 percent in April from a year earlier, while imports tumbled by a deeper-than-forecast 16.2 percent, fueling expectations that Beijing will quickly roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper economic slowdown.
The dismal trade performance raises the risk that second-quarter economic growth may dip below 7 percent for the first time since the depths of the global financial crisis, adding to official fears of job losses and growing levels of bad debt.
""This is bad. I expect an interest rate cut this weekend,"" said economist Tim Condon at ING in Singapore.
""This is going to make 7 percent (GDP) growth hard to attain. It looks like the weakness in the first quarter wasn't transitory. It's persistent.""
The central bank has lowered interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) thrice in three months since November to stoke the economy, and most analysts had expected it to loosen policy again on both fronts in coming months.
Policy insiders told Reuters this week that China's leaders have been caught off guard by the sharpness of the downturn, and are likely to resort to fiscal stimulus to revive growth after a flurry of monetary policy easing has proved less effective than hoped.
Imports have been weaker than exports, falling 16.2 percent in April from a year earlier, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Friday, highlighting tepid domestic demand as the world's second-largest economy slows.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports would rise 2.4 percent in April after a 15 percent plunge in March, and predicted imports would fall 12 percent after a 12.7 percent drop the previous month.
In April, exports to the United States, China's top export market, rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, while shipments to the European Union, the second largest market, dipped 10.4 percent, according to customs data.
UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK
Economists at Nomura expect annual economic growth to slow to 6.6 percent in the second quarter from 7 percent in the first quarter, and are penciling in three more 25-basis-point rate cuts and two more 50 bps cuts in banks' reserve requirements for the rest of the year, which would mark the central bank's most aggressive easing campaign since the global crisis.
Buffeted by lukewarm foreign and domestic demand, China's trade sector has wobbled in the past year, adding to pressure on the slowing economy and unsettling policymakers.
Earlier this week, China's trade minister said the devaluation of currencies by some countries has led to sharp gains in the yuan, hurting the competitiveness of Chinese exports.
The yuan has gained against major non-dollar currencies in recent months, leading to its rise on a trade-weight basis.
But Premier Li Keqiang has ruled out a devaluation, even as the economy faces headwinds.
While some exporters said they have not felt the impact of a rising yuan, thanks in part to the growing popularity of currency hedging options, few doubt that sales would suffer in coming months if the yuan sustains its ascent.
""If the demand in other countries does not improve, the declining trend in exports will continue, maybe even worsen,"" said Wang Jianhui, an analyst at Capital Securities in Beijing.
""On the import side, most infrastructure projects led by the government haven't begun yet, so demand for energy and steel is very low.""
China had a trade surplus of $34.13 billion for the month, widening from $3.08 billion in March.
Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang was quoted by Xinhua state news agency as saying last month that authorities must arrest China's export slowdown lest it further dampen economic growth.
China's trade grew 3.4 percent in 2014, missing the government's growth target of 7.5 percent by more than half.
The government has lowered its growth target for 2015, with combined imports and exports expected to rise around 6 percent.

China will release inflation data on Saturday, with factory output, retail sales and investment numbers expected next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers in April hired the fewest number of workers in more than a year, further diminishing hopes of a strong rebound in economic growth after the first-quarter slump.
The tepid private job gains combined with other data on Wednesday showing a second straight quarterly decline in productivity make it less likely the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June as had been expected at the start of the year.
""The data pile onto recent evidence suggesting increased odds that, by the time the June policy meeting rolls around, the hope of a great spring rebound in real growth will have faded,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.
Private payrolls increased 169,000 last month, the smallest gain since January 2014, the ADP National Employment Report showed. That was well below economists' expectations for an increase of 200,000 jobs. 
Hiring slowed almost across the board, with manufacturing losing 10,000 jobs after eliminating 3,000 positions in March, likely reflecting the impact of a strong dollar. Private sector job growth has slowed since November.
March private payrolls were revised down to show 14,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. The report jointly developed with Moody's Analytics was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.
The ADP has a poor track record of predicting nonfarm payrolls, and most economists are maintaining their forecasts for a bounce back in job growth after March's sharp slowdown, which was blamed on bad weather. 
They, however, acknowledged there was a slight downside risk. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 224,000 in April after rising by 126,000 in March.
""ADP typically doesn't do a good job of picking up short-term swings from weather and other temporary factors,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
""After over-predicting the nonfarm payrolls number in March, ADP will probably undershoot in April as weather swings in the positive direction."" 
Payrolls will be scrutinized closely for clues on the economy's strength after a mix of cold weather, the buoyant dollar, port disruptions and deep spending cuts by energy firms held first-quarter growth to an anemic 0.2 percent annual pace. 
But Tuesday's weak March trade data suggests the economy actually contracted in the first three months of the year after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
The dollar hit a 10-week low against the euro on the data and a spike in European bond yields, which buoyed demand for the single currency. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell on the European bond sell-off and Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) announcement of a new seven-part bond to help fund dividends and share buybacks.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned that equity market valuations at ""this point generally are quite high.""
PRODUCTIVITY WEAK 
Despite its spotty record, the ADP report joined data on automobile sales and manufacturing in suggesting moderate momentum in the economy at the start of the second quarter.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity declined at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter after dropping at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. That was the first back-to-back fall in productivity since 2006.
Productivity rose 0.6 percent from a year ago. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 5.0 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014, and followed a 4.2 percent rate of increase in the fourth quarter. 
The steadily rising labor costs against the backdrop of weak productivity could further squeeze corporate profits, which already are being pressured by the dollar.
""The weakness of productivity is another reason to believe that the Fed will begin to raise interest rates in the second half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Unit labor costs rose only 1.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 2014, a sign that wage inflation remains benign.

But there are signs wage growth is firming. Compensation per hour increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the first quarter, the quickest pace in a year. That came on the heels of data last week showing a solid rise in labor costs in the first quarter.

(Reuters) - Euro zone businesses started the second quarter with healthy growth as a buoyant order book again encouraged them to hire more, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Any sign that the bloc's recovery is gaining traction will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which embarked on a trillion-euro bond buying stimulus program in March, although the survey did show firms were still cutting prices.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to growth, was 53.9 in April, ahead of an earlier flash reading of 53.5 but just behind March's 11-month high of 54.0. A reading above 50 implies growth.
""The fact that the rate of growth failed to gain further momentum is a disappointment, but the national growth variations will give policymakers some real encouragement that the economic health of the region is improving,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
The PMIs suggest quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.4 percent for April-June, Williamson said, which would match forecasts for first-quarter growth.
But to drive that growth firms cut prices again - albeit less sharply in April. The composite output price index, which rose to 49.2 from 48.9, has now been below 50 for three years.
Official data last week showed the euro zone ended four months of deflation in March with consumer prices unchanged from year-ago levels.
Price discounting helped a PMI covering the dominant service industry remain elevated. It came in at 54.1, just shy of March's eight-month high of 54.2 but ahead of the flash 53.7 estimate.
The pace of new orders matched March's near four-year high of 54.6. That encouraged service firms to increase staffing levels for a sixth month."

1441,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2015 11:52AM ET</span>",U.S. trade data points to first-quarter economic contraction,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A surge in imports lifted the U.S. trade deficit in March to its highest level in nearly 6-1/2 years, suggesting the economy contracted in the first quarter.
Growth, however, is regaining momentum as other data on Tuesday showed activity in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, accelerated to a five-month high in April.
""It looks like we are going to have negative GDP for the first quarter, just based on trade, but we expect a robust rebound in the second quarter. A lot of the headwinds we saw in the first quarter have unwound,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit jumped 43.1 percent to $51.4 billion in March, the largest since October 2008. The percent rise was the biggest since December 1996. The surge came as imports snapped back after being held down by a now-settled labor dispute at key West Coast ports.
Economists had forecast the trade deficit rising to only $41.2 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the gap widened to $67.2 billion in March, the largest in eight years, from $51.2 billion in February.
U.S. stocks and Treasury debt prices were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
March's trade gap was far larger than the $45.2 billion deficit the government assumed in its snapshot of first-quarter gross domestic product last week. 
In that report, the government estimated trade sliced off 1.25 percentage points from GDP, helping to pull down growth to a 0.2 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Economists said growth could be lowered by at least six-tenths of a percentage point when the government publishes its second GDP estimate later this month.
NO SERIOUS DOWNTURN
The West Coast ports labor dispute, a strong dollar, deep spending cuts by energy companies reeling from lower oil prices, and bad weather hampered growth in the first quarter. But some of that drag on growth is fading.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index rose to 57.8 last month, the highest since November, from 56.5 in March. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector.
""There is little reason to believe that the potential contraction in first-quarter GDP is the start of a serious downturn in the U.S. economy,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Companies reported an increase in new orders and order backlogs. Export orders, however, contracted sharply, reflecting the dollar's impact. The greenback has gained about 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June, making American goods and services less competitive on the international market.
The trade report showed imports jumping 7.7 percent in March, the largest increase on record. 
Some of the imported goods likely ended up as inventories, which in the first quarter recorded their biggest increase since the third quarter of 2010. That inventory overhang could spell bad news for second-quarter GDP.
Imports of capital and consumer goods were the highest on record in March, while imports of industrial supplies and materials slumped to an all-time low. 
Imports of petroleum products hit a record low, highlighting lower crude oil prices and increased energy production in the United States, which has reduced its dependence on foreign oil.
The average import price for crude oil was $46.47 a barrel in March, the lowest in six years.
Exports increased 0.9 percent in March. Petroleum exports were the lowest since February 2011. Exports to the European Union rose 8.6 percent, with those to Germany reaching their highest level since October 2008.
The United States sold the fewest amount of goods and services to Brazil since April 2010. Exports to Canada and Mexico, the main U.S. trading partners, were up in March. 
Exports to China increased 13.6 percent, while imports from that country jumped 31.6 percent. That left the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.2 billion, up 38.6 percent from February. 

The U.S. trade deficit with Japan was the largest in two years.

Financial firm Markit said its final reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector slipped to 57.4 in April, a level that was down from both the preliminary April read of 57.8, as well as the final March read of 59.2. March's level was the highest since August.
A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
Markit's April reading of employment at services companies, meanwhile, rose to a 10-month high of 55.0 from March's 54.0. However, this was below the preliminary reading of 55.4.
The services index's new business component pulled back from the month before, when it had notched its highest level since September.
Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, fell to 57.0 from 59.2 in March. The preliminary reading was 57.4. Last week, Markit's final read on U.S. manufacturing activity showed slower growth in April.
""Robust service sector growth adds to evidence that the economy is far from stalling, as indicated by the GDP numbers seen at the start of the year, supporting the (U.S. Federal Reserve's) view of the economy growing at a 'moderate' rate,"" Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2015 01:53AM ET</span>","Australia's RBA cuts rates, markets wonder if that's all","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank cut interest rates for the second time this year on Tuesday, seeking to buttress the economy against sliding mining investment while heading off a harmful increase in the local dollar.
The currency did initially drop after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) trimmed its cash rate a quarter point to a fresh all time trough of 2.0 percent. Yet it soon rallied as investors wondered whether the easing cycle might now be over.
Indeed, the statement announcing the move noted some improvement in the economy while omitting a mention that further action could prove necessary.
""The Board judged that the inflation outlook provided the opportunity for monetary policy to be eased further, so as to reinforce recent encouraging trends in household demand,"" said RBA Governor Glenn Stevens.
He also offered a nod to recent better data.
""The available information suggests improved trends in household demand over the past six months and stronger growth in employment.""
As a result, interbank futures dipped from July onward and short term yields climbed as the market pared back the prospects of rates going under 2 percent. The local dollar first slid half a U.S. cent only to more than reverse the drop to stand at $0.7910.
""The statement is balanced and a bit more positive,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.
""Implicit is that they are fairly comfortable with where rates are now,"" she added. ""There is a good chance the cash rate goes below 2 percent but we know the hurdle to cut further is high. It won't happen until much later in the year.""
While past cuts have fueled a much-needed boom in home building they have also encouraged a speculative spike in Sydney house prices which has drawn the ire of regulators.
Ratings agency Fitch on Tuesday cautioned this latest easing would stoke the fire in Sydney property and only added to the case for tighter overview of bank lending.
LONGING FOR A LOWER A$
Though the RBA confounded expectations for cuts in March and April, the stars were better-aligned this time in large part due to a recent strengthening in the local dollar.
The currency touched a three-month top above 80 cents last week as a run of soft U.S. data undercut speculation the Federal Reserve would start raising its rates as early as June.
The rise was especially unwelcome as prices for iron ore, Australia's single biggest export earner, had halved to under $60 a tonne in a blow to company profits and tax revenues.
""Further depreciation (in the currency) seems both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices,"" Stevens said on Tuesday.
The impact on government finances will be all too evident when Treasurer Joe Hockey delivers his 2015/16 Budget next week, with deficits likely out to the end of the decade.
Hockey on Tuesday welcomed the latest cut in rates, claiming that the government's efforts to control spending had provided the room for the RBA to move.

The central bank will now have a chance to expand on its thinking in a quarterly review of the economy and policy due out on Friday.

1454,By Investing.com,"<span>May 05, 2015 12:34AM ET</span>","Reserve Bank of Australia cuts to record low 2%, citing moderate prices","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to a record low 2.00% as expected on Tuesday, citing a subdued inflation outlook and eyeing a further fall in the Australian dollar.For the full-text statement see below:Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy DecisionAt its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.0 per cent, effective 6 May 2015.The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but commodity prices have declined over the past year, in some cases sharply. These trends appear largely to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless.The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are stepping up the pace of unconventional policy measures. Hence, financial conditions remain very accommodative globally, with long-term borrowing rates for sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remarkably low.In Australia, the available information suggests improved trends in household demand over the past six months and stronger growth in employment. Looking ahead, the key drag on private demand is likely to be weakness in business capital expenditure in both the mining and non-mining sectors over the coming year. Public spending is also scheduled to be subdued. The economy is therefore likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. Inflation is forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending, and credit is recording moderate growth overall, with stronger lending to businesses of late. Growth in lending to the housing market has been steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates.The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices.At today's meeting, the Board judged that the inflation outlook provided the opportunity for monetary policy to be eased further, so as to reinforce recent encouraging trends in household demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.
The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.
""It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.
Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. 
That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.
The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.
The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.
Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices.
Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR), the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar. 
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.
""Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.""
Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines. 
Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories suffered their fastest drop in activity in a year in April as new orders shrank, a private business survey showed on Monday, hardening the case for fresh stimulus measures to halt a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
The latest indication of deepening factory woes raises the risk that second-quarter economic growth may dip below 7 percent for the first time since the depths of the global crisis, adding to official fears of job losses and local-level debt defaults.
The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.9 in April - the lowest level since April 2014 - from 49.6 in March, as demand faltered and deflationary pressures persisted.
The number was weaker than a preliminary reading of 49.2, and below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction compared with the previous month.
""China's manufacturing sector had a weak start to Q2, with total new business declining at the quickest rate in a year while production stagnated,"" said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at Markit.
""The PMI data indicate that more stimulus measures may be required to ensure the economy doesn't slow from the 7 percent annual growth rate seen in Q1.""
The overall new orders sub-index dipped to 48.7 in April, the sharpest contraction in a year. That suggested a marked deterioration in domestic demand, as new export orders showed tentative signs of improvement.
Both input and output prices declined for a ninth month, while manufacturers shed jobs for an 18th month, auguring poorly for an economy that grew at its weakest rate for six years in the first quarter.
An official survey released on Friday showed China's factories struggled to grow in April as domestic and export demand remained weak. The official number of 50.1 was the weakest reading for the month of April since the data started in 2005, HSBC noted.
The private survey focuses on small and mid-sized firms, while the official one looks at larger, state-owned companies.
China will release its April economic data over the coming weeks, starting with trade on Friday.
GROWTH COOLING
Aside from weakness in the manufacturing sector, China is struggling with a downturn in its property market, slowing investment and high levels of domestic debt.
On Thursday, the Politburo, the ruling Communist Party's top decision-making body, said that authorities will step up policy ""adjustments"" and urged further tax cuts. It also said the government must resolve financing glitches that are holding up big infrastructure projects.
Analysts believe the Politburo's emphasis on stabilizing growth signaled top leaders' increasing concerns about a sharper slowdown.
Economic growth is expected to slow further to 6.8 percent in the second quarter from 7 percent in the previous quarter, the State Information Center, a top government think tank, said in a research report published on Monday.
Millions of workers lost their jobs when China's growth tumbled to 6.6 percent in early 2009. A massive stimulus package pulled the economy out of the slump, but at the cost of saddling local governments with a mountain of debt.
The think-tank, which is affiliated to the National Development and Reform Commision, the top planning agency, called for interest rate cuts of 50 basis points in the first half, coupled with reductions in banks' reserves requirements.
The People's Bank of China last cut benchmark interest rates by 25 bps on Feb. 28 - its second cut since November.
The central bank has also reduced banks' reserve requirements (RRR) twice this year, by a total of 150 basis points, in a bid to boost their lending power, while home purchase rules have been eased to help the real estate market.
The think-tank also urged the government to lower the yuan currency's real effective exchange rate by 1-2 percent this year to help boost exports.
""Underlying economic activity appears to have slowed further from March, warranting more aggressive easing measures in the coming weeks in order for the economy to stabilize toward mid-year,"" Julia Wang, China economist at HSBC, said in a note.
Wang also expects a 25-bps rate cut in the second quarter.

Most economists believe China's economic growth could cool to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months, but stronger-than-expected vehicle sales suggested the economy was finding some momentum after almost stalling in the first quarter.
Still, the sluggishness in the manufacturing sector and other data on Friday showing construction spending hit a six-month low in March indicated that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint.
That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year.
The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production.
""The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013.
The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.
While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009.
Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar's 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June.
The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to cut their profit forecasts for the full year.
Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR), the world's largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling.
 Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year.
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.
REGAINING FOOTING
Despite the economy's struggles, there is no doubt it is starting to regain its footing. General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks and crossover and sports utility vehicles.
Demand for autos is likely to remain solid in the months ahead. In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March.
Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales.
""This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September.
Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak.
""We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2015 10:32AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment up in April from prior month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment in April rose versus the prior month to its highest level since January, but was slightly below analyst expectations for a final reading, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's final April reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 95.9, unchanged from the preliminary April reading. The final reading in March was 93.0. Analysts were looking for a final April reading of 96.0 according to a poll by Reuters.
The survey's final reading of the subindex on current conditions rose to 107 from 105.0 in March, while a read on final consumer expectations rose to 88.8 from 85.3. The median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for a reading of 108.3 for the conditions index and 88.1 for expectations.

Construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion, the lowest level since September, the Commerce Department said on Friday.
February's outlays were revised to show them unchanged instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip. Economists polled by Reuters had expected construction spending to rise 0.5 percent in March.
While there are signs the economy is regaining some speed after almost stalling in the first quarter, data on construction and manufacturing suggest a lack of strong momentum in activity.
The economy was slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar, a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have cut domestic energy production.
In March, construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest decline since June. Outlays for single-family construction fell 1.8 percent and multi-family home building tumbled 2.1 percent.
Spending on private non-residential construction projects rose 1.0 percent in March.

Public construction outlays were weak, with spending on federal government projects tumbling 4.9 percent. State and local government outlays - the largest portion of the public sector segment - fell 1.2 percent to a one-year low.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity was 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013. The reading fell shy of expectations of 52.0, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. This was the 29th-consecutive headline reading at or above 50.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's factories stayed stuck in the slow lane in April while Japanese output went into reverse and South Korea suffered its worst export performance in two years, adding urgency to calls for more state stimulus in all three economies.
Thailand has already surprised by cutting interest rates this week, while speculation is mounting that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will chop its rates to a record low of 2 percent at a May 5 policy meeting.
The need for action is all the greater as China, the former engine of global growth, remains jammed in neutral.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held at 50.1 in April, just a fraction above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
""As the economy still faces strong headwinds and the risk of deflation has not diminished, the authorities will need to continue to roll out easing measures in the coming months,"" said Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ.
Following an aggressive one-percentage-point cut in banks' reserve requirement ratios last month, ANZ expects China's central bank will lower its interest rates further this quarter.
China's annual economic growth slowed to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter, hurt by a housing slump and a downturn in investment and manufacturing.
In just the latest effort to turn the ship around, China's cabinet unveiled new measures on Friday to boost employment, offering more flexible tax breaks to companies to hire and preferential loans to business starters.
Beijing aims to create at least 10 million new jobs in 2015 and keep the urban jobless rate below 4.5 percent.
NOT ENOUGH INFLATION
In Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI fell to 49.9 in April, from 50.3 in March, taking it into contractionary territory for the first time since May last year.
Japan is emerging from recession at a snail's pace as companies remain wary of ramping up spending despite record profits and consumers keep their wallets shut.
That is challenging the Bank of Japan's bold pledge to accelerate inflation to 2 percent through massive money printing.
While core inflation did edge up a tick to an annual 2.2 percent in April, it is set to fall back toward zero in May when the impact of last year's rise in sales taxes drop out.
Neither have wages benefited as the BOJ hoped. Data out on Friday showed wage earners' total cash earnings were almost flat in March and inflation-adjusted real wages marked a two-year stretch of declines.
Across in South Korea, government figures showed exports fell 8.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the sharpest drop since February 2013, as shipments to China, the United States and the European Union all lost ground.
Consumer price inflation there is running at a 16-year trough of just 0.4 percent.
""The government will be sure to focus policy on boosting consumption as exports are no longer performing as they did in the past,"" said Stephen Lee, an economist at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities.
The doleful data follows news the United States grew a bare 0.2 percent annualized in the first quarter of the year, held back by wild weather, a port strike and a strong dollar.
Yet there were glints of light in more recent data.
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 15-year low last week and consumer spending rose in March, aided in part by a pick up in wage growth.

An upturn in wages has long been a key goal of the Federal Reserve and revived market expectations that interest rates would start to rise later this year, albeit not until September at the earliest.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2015 05:06AM ET</span>","UK consumer credit booms in March, business lending jumps too","LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - - Lending to British consumers jumped in March by its biggest amount since before the financial crisis and business borrowing showed its strongest rise in at least four years, the Bank of England said on Friday.
The figures, which come less than a week before a national election, suggest underlying strength in the British economy despite some recent weak data.
The BoE also said mortgage approvals inched down after rising for three straight months.
The BoE said consumer credit grew by 1.24 billion pounds in March, higher than a forecast of 800 million pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
That was the biggest monthly increase since February 2008 and compared with the same month last year, the increase was the biggest in nearly nine years.
Despite only weak rises in wages for much of the past five years, Britain's economic recovery has become increasingly reliant on spending by households.
A nascent recovery in earnings and zero inflation have helped boost confidence among consumers, although that has not translated into a clear lead in opinion polls for Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party ahead of the May 7 election.
There was also a big jump in lending to business in March which was up by 2.72 billion pounds, the largest monthly increase since records began in mid-2011, the BoE.
The lending figures have been erratic and on year-on-year terms, lending to businesses in March was 0.5 percent lower.
Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 61,341 in March, down a touch from 61,523 in February.
Analysts in the Reuters poll had forecast 62,400 mortgage approvals were made in March.
The number of approvals fell in most months last year, when tighter lending rules were introduced, cooling house price growth and easing concerns about a bubble in the housing market.
Net mortgage lending, which lags approvals, rose by 1.83 billion pounds, in line with forecasts.

There have been recent signs that Britain's housing market will regain strength this year. Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices rose in April at the fastest monthly pace since last June, while the British Bankers' Association has reported rising mortgage approvals in recent months."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits tumbled to a 15-year low last week and consumer spending rose in March, signs the economy was regaining momentum after stumbling badly in the first quarter.
The economic outlook was brightened further by another report on Thursday showing a solid increase in wages in the first quarter, which should keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this year.
""This morning's reports all point to an economy that is doing a lot better than the near-stagnation in first-quarter GDP suggests,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 262,000 for the week ended April 25, the lowest reading since April 2000, the Labor Department said. 
Though the decline, which far exceeded Wall Street's expectations for a drop to 290,000, likely exaggerates the labor market's health, it bolstered views that March's sharp moderation in job growth was probably an aberration. 
Separately, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4 percent last month as households stepped up purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles. 
The increase followed a 0.2 percent gain in February and indicated that consumer spending picked up momentum at the end of the first quarter, which bodes well for consumption in the April-June period.
While that should boost growth in the second quarter, the rebound in economic activity could be crimped by an inventory overhang, a strong dollar and ongoing spending cuts in the energy sector, which has been hit by lower oil prices.
Another report showed that factory activity in the Midwest accelerated in April, pushing further away from a 5-1/2-year low hit in February. 
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's business barometer rose to 52.3 from a March reading of 46.3. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in the region's factory sector. 
Stocks on Wall Street fell despite the fairly upbeat economic data, as Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL) cut its full-year profit forecast for the second time because of the buoyant dollar.
Sentiment was also hurt as ConocoPhillips (N:COP), the largest independent U.S. energy company, reported that its first-quarter profit fell to $272 million from $2.1 billion a year earlier due to lower crude prices.
Prices for U.S. government debt fell, with the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes touching near a seven-week high. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. 
WAGES ACCELERATING
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in March after being flat in the prior month.
The economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter as it struggled with severe winter weather, a now-settled labor dispute at normally busy West Coast ports, the strong dollar and lower energy prices, which have cut into domestic oil production.
The Fed on Wednesday acknowledged the first quarter's sharp growth moderation, but dismissed it as partly the result of transitory factors. 
Spending last month picked up despite personal income being flat. But the income weakness will likely prove temporary as the labor market gradually tightens.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, advanced 0.7 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. 
In the 12 months through March, labor costs jumped 2.6 percent, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2008. They are approaching the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent target.
Private sector wages and salaries increased 0.7 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in the prior quarter. They rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008.

""The conditions seem to be in place for labor costs to start breaking out on the upside, and that would be enough to provide the Fed with the confidence that the inflation target will be reached,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

1514,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 30, 2015 03:15AM ET</span>","BOJ Keeps Policy Steady, Focus On Inflation Forecasts","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The Bank of Japan maintained its massive monetary stimulus on Thursday, holding off on additional easing for now on hopes that rising wages will spur spending and eventually nudge inflation towards its 2 percent target.
Markets are now focusing on the central bank's semi-annual report on the economic and price outlook, due later on Thursday, for clues on how confident it is about Japan's economic recovery and prospects for hitting its ambitious inflation target.
With inflation having ground to a halt due to slumping oil prices, the BOJ is seen slightly cutting its core consumer inflation forecast of 1.0 percent for the current fiscal year ending in March 2016, sources say.
But the nine-member board is likely to project inflation will hit roughly 2 percent in the following two years. Such bullish forecasts on the long-term outlook likely led the BOJ's nine board members to forgo easing policy for now.
However, the board may consider watering down the timeframe for hitting the inflation target. At present, it expects Japan to hit 2 percent inflation at or around the current fiscal year.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its pledge to increase base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($674 billion) through purchases of government bonds and risky assets.
Still, many analysts expect the BOJ to ease policy later this year as inflation slides further away from its ambitious target.
""While additional easing is unlikely to take place this week, we think additional BOJ stimulus is a matter of time,"" HSBC (LONDON:HSBA) economist Izumi Devalier said in a research note.
""We believe the central bank will announce enhanced easing measures by the end of the second quarter, most likely at the June 19 policy meeting.""
Japan is emerging from recession but at a snail's pace, as companies remain wary of ramping up spending despite record profits and consumers keep their purse strings tight.
Despite a raft of weak data so far this year, the government appears to be in no mood to pressure the BOJ to do more at this time. Japan's vice economy minister said recently it would ""not be a big deal"" if the timing for hitting 2 percent inflation is delayed by oil price falls.
Aides close to premier Shinzo Abe have said further monetary easing could trigger unwelcome falls in the yen that would boost import costs, offsetting the benefits consumers and small firms are enjoying from the falling cost of fuel.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also voiced confidence his massive stimulus program was succeeding in cracking the ""deflationary mindset"" that haunted Japan for 15 years.
The BOJ surprised markets last October by expanding its asset purchase program after cutting its forecasts, days after Kuroda had assured parliament that a recovery was on track.
Central bankers have stressed since then that they will look through the effect of lower oil costs, which are largely blamed for inflation evaporating in February.
But consumption has failed to rebound, underscoring doubts held by analysts that inflation will accelerate as quickly as the BOJ projects.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect core consumer inflation to hit 0.3 percent this fiscal year and 1.3 percent the following year, barely half the pace projected by the BOJ.
""I expect the BOJ to downgrade this fiscal year's CPI forecast to 0.6 or 0.7 percent inflation and emphasize that it expects domestic demand-driven inflation to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year,"" said Daiju Aoki, senior economist at UBS Securities.
""The BOJ will take a wait-and-see stance. Easing now is not going to push up wages."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth nearly stalled in the first quarter as harsh weather dampened consumer spending and energy companies struggling with low prices slashed spending.
Gross domestic product expanded at an only 0.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. That was a big step down from the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent pace and marked the weakest reading in a year.
A strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at normally busy West Coast ports also slammed growth, the government said.
While there are signs the economy is pulling out of the soft patch, the lack of a vigorous growth rebound has convinced investors the U.S. Federal Reserve will wait until late this year to start hiking interest rates.
The recovery is the slowest on record and the economy has yet to experience annual growth in excess of 2.5 percent.
""The U.S. economy has yet to demonstrate the self-sustaining resilience that the Fed wants to see before raising interest rates,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""A June liftoff is now off the table, our forecast for a September move holds but even that has become tenuous.""
Fed officials at the end of their two-day policy meeting on Wednesday acknowledged the softer growth, but shrugged it off as ""in part reflecting transitory factors.""
The dollar hit a nine-week low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell in line with a global bond sell-off, sparked by a poorly received five-year German bond auction. U.S. stocks were trading lower. 
Economists had expected the economy to expand at a 1.0 percent rate. The sharp growth slowdown is probably not a true reflection of the economy's health, given the role of temporary factors such as the weather and the ports dispute.
""The extent and depth of the weakness in today's GDP report, sets the U.S. up for another disappointing though somewhat better GDP report in the second quarter. We are not ready to throw in the towel for the year,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
HIBERNATING CONSUMERS
The economy has had a jerky recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, with the first quarter marking only the latest setback. The government did not quantify the impact of the weather, the strong dollar, lower energy prices and the ports disruptions on growth last quarter. 
Economists, however, estimate unusually cold weather in February chopped off as much as half a percentage point, with the port disruptions shaving off a further 0.3 percentage point.
The weather impact was evident in weakness in consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.9 percent rate. That was the slowest in a year and followed a brisk 4.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
The sharp moderation in consumer spending came even though households enjoyed huge savings from a big drop in gasoline prices. Consumers boosted their savings to $727.8 billion from $603.4 billion in the fourth quarter, which should provide a tailwind for future consumer spending.
Construction also took a hit, while lower energy prices, which have cut into domestic oil production, undermined business investment. 
Spending on nonresidential structures, which includes oil exploration and well drilling, tumbled at a 23.1 percent rate. That was the fastest pace of decline in four years and the first contraction since the first quarter of 2013. 
The decline was driven by mining exploration, shafts and wells investment, which plunged at a 48.7 percent pace.
Nonresidential structures lopped off 0.75 percentage point from growth.
Schlumberger (N:SLB), the world's No. 1 oil-field services provider, has slashed its capital spending plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion, while competitor Halliburton (N:HAL) cut its by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.
Economists believe the bulk of the spending cuts were front-loaded into the first quarter, and they expect they will present less of a drag on growth in the April-June quarter.
""The weakness in business investment in response to the oil price shock may be transitory, but we continue to have doubts that the next leg of faster investment will kick in if GDP growth, especially consumer demand, does not improve significantly,"" said Dana Peterson, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The dollar, which gained 4.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners in the first quarter, weighed on trade, as did the West Coast ports dispute. Trade subtracted 1.25 percentage points from first-quarter growth.
There was a surprise increase in inventory accumulation, which added 0.74 percentage point to GDP growth. 

Inventories increased $110.3 billion, the largest gain since the third quarter of 2010 and one that suggests inventories will weigh on growth in the second quarter.

1534,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2015 02:08PM ET</span>",Fed removes all calendar references on the timing of a rate hike,"Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve, as expected kept interest rates at its current level following the conclusion of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, but offered little hints on the timing of its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
In the FOMC's latest statement, the Fed has removed all calendar references on a potential window for raising its benchmark Fed Funds Rate. Opting instead to employ a data driven approach for lift-off, the Fed indicated that it is hesitant to raise rates until it sees improvements in the labor market and it is confident that inflation will move back toward its target range of 2%. Furthermore, the Fed said it will take into account labor market conditions, inflationary pressures and expectations of international financial developments when it decides on the timing of a rate increase.
In March, the Fed removed a stance of ""remaining patient"" on policy normalization, a reference which typically indicates that it is ready to raise rates. A raft of soft economic data in recent weeks, however, has ostensibly convinced the U.S. central bank to delay lift-off. On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that GDP for the first quarter expanded by 0.2%, far below analysts' forecasts of 1% growth.
Though unemployment remained steady since the FOMC's last meeting on Mar. 17, the Fed indicated it was disappointed with a number of other economic indicators including: household spending declines, weak export figures and low inflation. The Fed is still optimistic for improved growth in the second quarter as transitory factors such as unseasonable weather and low energy prices dissipate.
""Although growth and output slowed during the first quarter, the committee expects with appropriate policy accommodation that economic activity with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate,"" the FOMC said in a statement.
The Fed will also keep a close eye on a broad measure of unemployment known as the U-6 unemployment rate, as it looks for improvements in labor activity. The gauge includes people who are working part-time and those who are marginally attached to the labor force but are neither working, nor looking for work. The oft-quoted U-3 rate, which measures workers that actively sought a job in the past four weeks but did not find one, held steady at 5.5% in March. After the U-6 rate ticked above 11.0% in January, Fed chair Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee that it ""definitely shows a less rosy picture"" of employment in the country.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained roughly 40 points to 18,043.04, minutes after the announcement. Roughly half-hour before the release, the Dow was down 118.45 at 17,991.69. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of other major currencies, pared earlier losses to stand at 95.21. The index had already been down by more than 1.25% for the day ahead of the statement.
It is now increasingly becoming likely that the Fed will wait until September or even December to institute a rate hike. Previously, the Fed indicated that it could start raising rates in June.
The Fed has kept short-term interest rates at near zero since 2009, following the Financial Crisis."
1535,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2015 02:04PM ET</span>","Fed points to softer U.S. labor market, weak economic growth","By Michael Flaherty and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday pointed to weakness in the U.S. labor market and economy, in a sign that the central bank is struggling to proceed with its plans to raise interest rates this year.
The Fed's policy statement puts it on track to begin a meeting-by-meeting approach toward deciding when to pull the trigger on its first rate hike since June 2006.
The central bank, however, acknowledged soft patches across the economy, making it more likely that it will not be ready to hike rates until at least September.
""The committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" the Fed said in its statement, following a two-day meeting of its policy-setting committee.
The Fed's rate guidance mirrored what it gave last month.
But unlike its March policy statement, this time the central bank did not effectively rule out hiking rates at its next meeting.
While that makes a June move possible, the economic data is not cooperating.
The economy grew at an anemic 0.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported early on Wednesday, well below economists' expectations for 1 percent growth and the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent expansion.
The Fed acknowledged that economic growth ""had slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."" In March, the Fed described growth as having moderated somewhat.
Economists see September as the more likely time for a rate hike, while investors see an even later time horizon, with futures contracts pointing more toward December.
The central bank will have at least two months of economic data to consider before its next policy-setting meeting in June, when it also issues new economic projections and conducts a press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

There were no dissents at the meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homeownership slipped to a 25-year low in the first quarter, but sustained strong gains in the pace at which Americans are setting up homes supported the view that the housing sector will boost economic growth this year.
The seasonally adjusted home ownership rate dipped to 63.8 percent, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1989, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The rate, which peaked at 69.4 percent in 2004, was 64.0 percent in the fourth quarter.
Household formation, however, increased by 1.5 million in the first quarter from the same period in 2014. It was up 1.7 million in the fourth quarter.
""This is a signal of something very positive that should flow through the economy. We should see better numbers in terms of home sales, housing starts and spending around housing than we are now,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.After a lackluster performance in the past year, housing is expected take the baton from weak business investment - especially energy-related capital expenditure - and together with consumer spending drive the economy in 2015.
With many Americans still showing an aversion to homeownership, the gains in household formation largely are being driven by renters. That should provide a boost to home building, especially in the multi-family segment of the market.
A strengthening labor market is encouraging young adults to move out of their parents' homes, as well as from accommodation shared with friends and relatives.
""A long overdue upturn in household formation, as more young adults leave the parental home, could provide a significant boost to home building over the coming years,"" said Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics in London.
While the residential rental vacancy rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 7.1 percent in the first quarter, it remained near 20-year lows. That could put some upward pressure on inflation later this year, economists said.
Homeownership dipped in three of the four regions in the first quarter, falling almost across all age groups.
Some economists, however, believe the homeownership rate will probably start stabilizing in the coming quarters, citing moves by the government to ease credit conditions for first-time home buyers as well as the firming labor market.

""With credit conditions now loosening and employment set to continue growing strongly, we suspect this long downward trend may not last for much longer,"" Stansfield said.

1562,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 28, 2015 07:15AM ET</span>",Britain's Recovery Slows Sharply In First Quarter Of 2015,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed more sharply than expected in the first three months of 2015, a setback for Prime Minister David Cameron who has staked his campaign for re-election next week on the strength of the recovery.
Gross domestic product grew by 0.3 percent in the January-March period, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. It was the slowest quarterly growth since the end of 2012 when there were fears Britain was heading into recession.
The growth was half that of the last three months of 2014 and below the median forecast for only a marginal slowdown to 0.5 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
The pound weakened against both the dollar and euro, and British government bond prices rose.
Finance Minister George Osborne said the data showed recovery in Britain could not be taken for granted and sought to argue persuade voters it meant they should stick with the Conservative Party.
""GDP figures show future of the economy is on the ballot paper,"" Osborne wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Now is worst possible time to vote for instability at home.""
The preliminary reading of GDP is largely an estimate and the figures are often revised. The chief economist at the ONS, Joe Grice, warned against reading too much into the data.
But coming just nine days before the May 7 election, the slowdown will be seized upon by Labour which has been running neck-and-neck with Cameron's Conservatives in opinion polls.
The Conservatives' campaign message has been dominated by references to the successes of their ""long-term economic plan"" and calls on voters to give them another term in office to finish off the job of fixing Britain's public finances.
Labour is focused on what it calls Britain's cost-of-living crisis after wages failed to keep pace with inflation throughout most of the five years since Cameron became prime minister.
SERVICES SLOWDOWN
Britain's economy was 2.4 percent bigger than it was in the first quarter of last year, the ONS said. The Reuters poll had forecast annual growth of 2.6 percent.
Strong private-sector surveys of business had led most economists to predict only a moderate slowdown.
Britain's economy is now 4.0 percent larger than its peak before the financial crisis, and 8.4 percent bigger than when Cameron's Conservative-led coalition came to power in May 2010.
The weak first-quarter growth contrasts with an upbeat tone from the Bank of England at its latest monetary policy meeting.
Most economists expect the economy to keep its momentum in 2015 after last year's growth of 2.8 percent, which was the strongest among the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
""The news that the UK's economic recovery slowed sharply in the first quarter clearly won't help the coalition parties (Conservatives and Liberal Democrats), but the slowdown should just be temporary,"" Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
Household incomes were on track to show their strongest growth since 2006, helped by low inflation, she said.
But some economists have said an inconclusive outcome of next week's elections could hurt confidence and slow investment."

Financial firm Markit said its ""flash,"" or preliminary, reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector slipped to 57.8 in April from a final reading of 59.2 in March, which had been the highest level since August.
A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
Markit's April reading of employment at service companies, meanwhile, rose to a 10-month high of 55.4 from March's 54.0.
The services index's new business component pulled back slightly from the month before, when it had notched its highest level since September.
Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, dropped to 57.4 from 59.2 last month. Last week, Markit in its flash reading of U.S. manufacturing activity said the goods-producing sector's growth fell in April by the most in six months, although it remained solidly in expansion territory.
""Alongside a solid rise in output signaled by the sister manufacturing PMI survey, the robust growth signaled by the services survey points to the economy as a whole picking up speed again after a temporary soft patch at the start of the year,"" Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.

The Markit surveys suggest annual gross domestic product growth could accelerate to around 3 percent in the second quarter from a very anemic first-quarter pace of around 1.0 percent, Williamson said.

On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates increasing order volume is expected, below indicates expectations are for lower volume.
The survey of 468 firms reported an easing of growth in total new orders, but this still remained well above average. Domestic orders rose modestly, whilst exports growth remained unexpectedly sluggish.
Commenting on the report, Katja Hall, CBI Deputy Director-General, said, ""Exports keep dragging at the heels of growth: firms are finding the recent rise in the pound against the euro challenging, making them less competitive in Europe, while the unravelling situation in Greece is creating uncertainty.""
Firms have stronger expectations for the three months ahead, with output and orders growth anticipated to firm up and predictions for exports growth at their strongest since July 2014.

The Commerce Department said on Friday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest drop since July 2013.
The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February.
Business spending on capital goods has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, which has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies. At the same time, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL).
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.3 percent.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.
Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. That downward revision together with March's weak reading could see economists trim their first-quarter GDP growth estimates, which currently range between a 0.5 percent and 2 percent annual pace.
A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month.

That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.

Facing slowing economic growth, Chinese authorities have said that avoiding mass unemployment is a crucial policy priority, although the urban jobless rate is widely known to understate the real unemployment figure, a point acknowledged by the government.
The government aims to create at least 10 million new jobs in 2015 and keep the urban jobless rate below 4.5 percent.
The urban unemployment rate hovered between 4 percent and 4.5 percent in the last decade, even during the global financial crisis, partly because it does not account for China's 298 million migrant labor.
To improve the data, the Chinese government has devised a new jobless rate that is compiled through surveys. The statistics bureau said last week that the survey-based jobless rate hovered around 5.1 percent.
China's annual economic growth slowed to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter, hurt by a housing slump and a downturn in investment and manufacturing.
Authorities have rolled out a series of stimulus measures over the last year, including two interest rate cuts since November, to cushion the blow, but have indicated they may be willing to tolerate somewhat cooler growth if the labor market remains resilient.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday sales declined 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000 units. That was the biggest percent drop since July 2013.
February's sales pace was revised up to 543,000 units, the highest level since February 2008, from the previously reported 539,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 8.5 percent of the market, falling only to a 513,000-unit pace last month.

New homes sales tumbled 33.3 percent in the Northeast and 3.4 percent in the West. Sales in the South dropped 15.8 percent, the biggest decline since July 2013. They rose 5.9 percent in the Midwest.

The stock of new houses available on the market rose 1.9 percent last month to 213,000. Supply still remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom, good news for home builders who will need to ramp up construction.

The index's flash output component fell from the final March read of 58.8 to 55.4, which was also the weakest since January.
The flash reading of the index measuring new orders also weakened in April, coming in at 55.4, compared with March's reading of 57.2.

Employment growth also weakened in April from March, Markit said, though the drop was more modest.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2015 09:08AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims edge up; trend signals firmer labor market,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week for a third straight week, but the underlying trend continued to point to a solidly improving labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 295,000 for the week ended April 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised.
The claims data covered the period during which the government canvassed employers for April's nonfarm payrolls report.
Employment growth slowed sharply in March, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 126,000, ending a 12-month stretch of gains above 200,000. But with the weakness mostly concentrated in the weather-sensitive leisure and construction sectors, economists downplayed the slowdown.
Federal Reserve officials have said they would like to see further improvements in the labor market before raising interest rates. Faltering economic growth at the start of the year has made a June rate hike less likely.
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast jobless claims slipping to 290,000 last week.
U.S. stock index futures extended losses after the data, while prices for U.S. government debt were largely unchanged. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies.
A Labor Department analyst said there was nothing unusual in the state-level data.
Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because moving holidays like Easter and school spring breaks often throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 1,750 last week to 284,500. Claims below 300,000 are associated with a strengthening labor market.
The four-week average of claims fell 20,750 between the March and April survey periods, suggesting an acceleration in job growth.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 50,000 to 2.33 million in the week ended April 11.

The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.7 in April from a final 50.3 in March.
The index fell below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since May last year.
New orders fell to a preliminary 48.5 from 49.4 in March, contacting for a second straight month and at a faster clip.
The output index fell to 49.7 in April, its first contraction in nine months.
The index for new export orders also fell to a preliminary 51.0 from a final 52.0 in the previous month, but continued to expand as the weak yen helped improve Japanese exporters' price competitiveness.
The final Markit/JMMA PMI for April will be released on May 1.
The declines in manufacturing activity according to the PMI index are still relatively small, but government data on industrial output has already cast some doubt on the strength of the corporate sector.

Industrial output fell more than expected in February, and economists will pore over output data for March due next week to see if output recovers. Forecasts for the March data are not available yet.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in a year in April, a private survey showed, suggesting that economic conditions are still deteriorating despite increasingly aggressive policy easing by the central bank.
The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 in April, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis.
After a brief rebound in February, the index has now been back in negative territory for two consecutive months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 49.6, equal to March's final reading.
The sharp decline in employment witnessed in March moderated somewhat and export orders rose for the first time in three months, but most of the news was bad.
New orders declined further to a one-year low of 49.2 from March's 49.8, pointing to softer domestic demand.
Meanwhile, declines in input and output prices, which had appeared to moderate in March, showed signs of accelerating again, signaling intensifying deflationary pressures which are a key worry for policymakers.
The weak PMI adds to a growing number of signs that China's economy is decelerating more rapidly than most analysts had expected, and perhaps some policymakers as well.
March money supply and industrial production year-on-year growth both came in at or near multi-year lows, with the latter posting its worst performance since the global financial crisis.
Economists have cautioned that some of the extreme weakness in March may be a reflection of the very late Lunar New Year celebrations in 2015, which distort year-on-year comparisons based on the western calendar. Many factories and offices shut for lengthy periods during the holidays.
But the continuing weakness in the April flash PMI adds to evidence that the world's second-largest economy is still slowing.
""Most of the activity and spending data for March came in below consensus,"" the Capital Economics China team wrote in a recent note.
""We suspect this was partly the result of lingering disruption from the Chinese New Year. But downside risks to growth appear greater now than they did a month or two ago.""
Particularly worrying from a policymaking perspective are renewed signs of rapidly falling prices. The Chinese government and central bank have closely studied lessons from neighboring Japan, Asia's former dynamo whose policy mis-steps plunged it into decades of deflation from which it is still struggling to escape.
Weighed down by a cooling property market, industrial overcapacity and local debt, China's economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, its slowest expansion in 24 years. Economists expect growth to cool further to 7 percent in 2015, even with additional stimulus measures.
The central bank has cut interest rates twice since November, on top of a raft of other monetary and fiscal measures announced over the past year, most recently a 100 basis point cut to banks' required reserve ratios on Sunday.

More such support measures are seen in coming months, with the central bank expected to embark on its boldest easing campaign since the depths of the global financial crisis.

There are some areas of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for capacity pressures, including the lingering effects of the recent drought in parts of the country, fiscal consolidation, lower dairy incomes and the impact of the high exchange rate on some export and import substitution industries,"" McDermott said.The RBNZ is also assessing the outlook for tradable inflation that is being dampened by global conditions and the high exchange rate, McDermott said. ""The fact that the exchange rate has appreciated while our key export prices, such as dairy, have been falling, is unwelcome.""""The timing of future adjustments in interest rates will depend on the evolution of inflationary pressures in both the traded and non-traded sectors. We continue to monitor and carefully assess the emerging flow of economic data,"" McDermott said, even as he ruled out prospect of increase in the official cash rate in the near term.""At present, the bank is not considering any increase in interest rates. Before considering any tightening in monetary policy we would need to be confident that increased capacity utilisation and labor market tightness was generating, or about to generate, a substantial increase in inflation,"" McDermott said.In fact, the outlook for inflation requires a period of supportive monetary policy, McDermott said.""Our approach, as a flexible inflation targeter, is to support ongoing sustainable growth in New Zealand that should help raise costs and prices in order to achieve our inflation target. We will not react to temporary deviations from target, as this will only generate unnecessary volatility in activity,"" he said.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2015 02:16PM ET</span>",Home sales vault to 18-month high as supply improves,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales surged to their highest level in 18 months in March as more homes came on the market, a sign of strength in housing ahead of the spring selling season.
The fairly upbeat report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday implied the economy was regaining some momentum after hitting a speed bump at the start of the year.
But tepid retail sales and weak factory data suggested the growth rebound will probably be insufficient to convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June.
""It's consistent with strong growth in the second quarter. We should have a solid spring selling season and should see the housing market continuing to improve through 2015,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Existing home sales increased 6.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.19 million units in March, the highest level since September 2013. The percent rise was the largest since December 2010. Last month's sales outpaced economists' expectations for a 5.03 million-unit rate.
The outlook for the spring selling season, which runs from April through August, was also boosted by a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing applications for loans to purchase homes jumped 5 percent last week to the highest level since June 2013.
It was the fourth time in five weeks that purchase applications rose and economists attributed this to moves by the government to ease credit conditions for first-time buyers.
Home sales have been constrained by a shortage of properties on the market, which has pushed up home prices and limited choice for potential buyers. Fewer homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, meaning fewer foreclosed properties in the pipeline to boost supply.
As such, builders would have to break more ground on new housing units to boost inventories. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, on Wednesday reported a 30 percent jump in orders.
Despite the sturdy home resales report, the housing index (HGX) fell more than 1 percent. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
SUPPLY IMPROVING
In March, the inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 5.3 percent from a month ago to 2 million units, the highest level since last November. However, supply was up only 2 percent from a year ago.
Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay longer in their homes. A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years.
At March's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear houses from the market, down from 4.7 months in February. A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
With supply still tight, the median price for a previously owned home increased 7.8 percent from a year ago to $212,100.
That was the largest percentage gain since February 2014 and suggested that the pace of home price increases, which had been slowing after double-digit growth for much of 2013, appears to be reaccelerating.
""It looks like the combination of limited available inventory and a decline in the share of distressed sales in the market continue to put upward pressure on prices,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

First-time buyers accounted for 30 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent share that economists and realtors say is required for a strong housing recovery.

1620,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 22, 2015 06:15AM ET</span>","BOE Unanimous On Rates, More Upbeat On EU","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Bank of England policymakers have grown more upbeat about the outlook for the euro zone and see a greater chance that inflation could recover strongly next year, minutes of their April policy meeting showed on Wednesday.
The minutes of the April 8-9 meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee showed that the officials voted unanimously to keep rates steady at a record-low 0.5 percent, but that for two members this decision remained ""finely balanced"".
The central bank said that British domestic data had been broadly in line with what they expected when the central bank made its last set of forecasts in February, but that the euro zone appeared to be recovering more strongly than thought.
""Although it was too early to be confident, a succession of firmer data suggested that growth in the euro area economy was picking up,"" the BoE said.
Weak demand in the euro zone has weighed on Britain's economy for years, and the BoE said the benefits of stronger growth would outweigh ""any influence the ECB's asset purchase program was having on the configuration of exchange rates"".
The U.S. economy had unexpectedly disappointed over the previous month, but the BoE said there was a good chance that this would prove temporary.
For some policymakers, weakness in the United States and China counterbalanced the stronger news from the euro zone, the BoE said.
British consumer price inflation hit a record low of zero in February and remained there in March, and the central bank said it still expected this rate to briefly fall into negative territory in the coming months.
However, policymakers appeared slightly more focused on upside risks to British inflation than in previous months.
Strong economic growth was unlikely to be able to continue without pushing up prices and wages, which needed to grow faster to help the BoE hit its 2 percent inflation target.
The central bank also noted the possibility that sterling strength had been having a more rapid than expected effect on inflation, implying that inflation could then bounce back more strongly when temporary downward pressures on prices faded.
Governor Mark Carney and other policymakers have said they expect the next move by the Bank to be a rate hike.
Nonetheless, the BoE's chief economist surprised investors in March when he said the recent sharp slowdown in inflation meant the bank was as likely as not to cut rates as raise them.
Financial markets are pricing in the first increase in borrowing costs next year.
Two members of the MPC, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted in favor of a rate increase in late 2014 but rejoined no-hike the majority in January as inflation tumbled
The minutes published on Wednesday also showed the nine members of the MPC all voted to keep the Bank's stockpile of government bonds, amassed as a further stimulus for the British economy, unchanged at 375 billion pounds."

1631,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 21, 2015 08:00AM ET</span>",German Investors Rein In Expectations For Strong Economy: Survey,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - German analysts and investors see further growth potential for Europe's biggest economy, though its already strong base means any further improvement may be limited, the ZEW think tank's April survey showed on Tuesday.
The Mannheim-based institute said its monthly survey of economic sentiment fell to 53.3 points from 54.8 in March, undershooting a Reuters consensus forecast of 55.3 points.
That was the indicator's first fall since October, but a separate gauge of current conditions soared to 70.2 points from 55.1 in March, easily beating a consensus forecast for a reading of 56.0.
""Germany is doing fine. In fact, it may now be doing so well that some observers believe it can't get much better,"" said Berenberg economist Holger Schmieding.
ZEW said the world economy was dampening Germany's export prospects and reducing the potential for further improvement, and some economists also cited concerns about Greece’s debt crisis as a factor in investors' weaker expectations.
However, ZEW economists said the investors surveyed expected a ""very good situation"" to continue for at least the next half year and noted that German private consumption, seen as the mainstay of growth this year, would strengthen further.
The German government plans on Wednesday to raise its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from its current estimate of 1.5 percent and sees a similar rate of growth for 2016, sources have told Reuters.
""Strong tailwinds from a robust labor market, low oil prices and a competitively priced exchange rate as well as the reform successes in countries such as Spain are propelling the German economy forward,"" said Schmieding.
The Bundesbank agreed with that assessment in a report on Monday which said strong private consumption, low unemployment and rising wages would sustain Germany's upswing for some time to come, despite slower recent industrial performance.
The ZEW index was based on a survey of 238 analysts and investors conducted between April 7-20."

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment declined by 1.5 points to 53.3 this month from March’s reading of 54.8. Analysts had expected the index to improve by 0.5 points to 55.3 in April.
The Current Conditions Index improved to 70.2 this month from 55.1 in March, better than expectations for a rise to 56.0.
Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment increased to a 14-month high of 64.8 in April from 62.4 in March, above forecasts for a gain to 63.7.

Others PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsMembers noted that growth of Australia's major trading partners had continued at around its average pace in early 2015. Growth in China looked to have eased a little further and this was likely to have contributed to further declines in iron ore and coal prices. Globally, the fall in oil prices in the second half of 2014 had led to lower inflation and was expected to provide additional support to demand in Australia's trading partners. Monetary policies remained very accommodative.In China, the authorities had announced a target for GDP growth in 2015 of 7 per cent, ½ percentage point below the target for 2014. Recent indicators suggested that economic conditions had softened. Growth of fixed asset investment had been slowing, particularly in real estate and manufacturing, and prices of residential property and sales volumes had declined further. Members noted that the deterioration in conditions in the property market had increased the vulnerability of leveraged property developers and local authorities that relied on revenue from land sales to support their infrastructure investment. They also noted that the central authorities had indicated a willingness to adjust policies to support employment growth, while remaining committed to putting financing on a more sustainable footing. The weakness in the property market in China had flowed through to slower growth in the demand for steel, which had, in turn, contributed to the recent falls in iron ore prices, even though Chinese imports of Australian iron ore had continued to increase.The modest recovery of the Japanese economy was continuing. Labour market conditions remained tight and the recent annual spring wage negotiations had resulted in several large companies increasing base wages by more than they did a year earlier. In the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, growth had continued at around its average pace of the past decade, although there had been variation in the composition of growth across the region.Members observed that the US economy had continued to grow, but that the pace of growth may have moderated in the early months of this year partly in response to the temporary effects of adverse weather conditions and industrial action at some ports. Labour market conditions had strengthened further over the past six months or so; employment had increased at around its fastest pace in several years and the unemployment rate had declined further. Members noted that overall wage growth in the United States remained subdued. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had indicated that it was likely to begin the process of normalising interest rates in the second half of this year if economic conditions continued to evolve as expected.In the euro area, economic activity had continued to recover gradually. The unemployment rate had declined a little further and there had been a noticeable lift in activity in some euro area periphery economies. Lower oil prices had reduced consumer price inflation significantly, but core measures of consumer price inflation had not changed much in recent months and remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). There had been some signs that conditions in the construction sector had stabilised and credit to both households and businesses was increasing, albeit gradually.Members observed that bulk commodity prices had declined further over the past month. Although much of the decline over 2014 was driven by expansion in global supply, the slowing in growth of Chinese demand had contributed more recently. A small (but increasing) share of Australian iron ore production was estimated to be unprofitable at prevailing prices, while the decline in oil prices since the middle of 2014 was expected to lower the prices of Australian liquefied natural gas exports over the next few months.Domestic Economic ConditionsThe December quarter national accounts, which were released the day after the March meeting, confirmed that the Australian economy had grown at a below-average pace over 2014. Members noted that growth in dwelling investment, consumption and resource exports had picked up, but that business investment had continued to fall and public demand had made little contribution to growth over the year. Recent indicators suggested that the below-trend pace of GDP growth had continued into the March quarter.Overall conditions in the housing market had remained strong, supported by very low interest rates and relatively strong population growth. Housing prices had continued to rise strongly in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne, but growth in prices had eased recently in some other parts of the country. Other indicators of activity had also suggested strong conditions in the established housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. Housing credit overall had been growing at about 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, while credit to investors had grown at a pace a little above 10 per cent on the same basis. Recent data on loan approvals suggested that growth in housing credit was likely to continue at this pace, but not accelerate, in the months immediately ahead. Meanwhile, new dwelling approvals and loan approvals for new construction were at high levels, pointing to strong growth in dwelling investment over coming quarters.Household consumption had increased in the December quarter, supported by low interest rates and rising household wealth. Even so, growth in household consumption over the second half of 2014 had been slightly below average, reflecting subdued growth in household income, while the saving ratio had continued its gradual decline of the past two years. More timely data had indicated that growth in the value of retail trade in January and February was about average and that consumer confidence had been close to average levels.Mining investment was estimated to have declined by 13 per cent over 2014 and an even larger decline was expected over 2015. Moreover, members observed that the recent declines in oil prices could lead to some scaling back of investment plans in the oil and gas sector. Non-mining investment had been subdued for some time. Forward-looking indicators (such as the ABS capital expenditure survey and non-residential building approvals) as well as liaison suggested that it was likely to remain subdued, and could even decline, over the next year or so. Members noted, however, that there had been a pick-up in growth of credit to businesses of late. They also observed that the strongest improvement in investment intentions (apparent in the recent capital expenditure survey) had been recorded for industries experiencing the strongest output growth, such as rental, hiring & real estate and retail trade. More recently, survey measures of business confidence and capacity utilisation remained a little below average, while measures of business conditions were around average levels.Members observed that there had been significant variation in the composition of domestic demand growth across the states over the course of 2014. Dwelling investment and consumption had contributed to growth in all states, whereas business investment had subtracted from growth in Queensland and Western Australia, mainly reflecting the decline in mining investment in these states. Members noted that public demand had contributed to domestic demand growth only in New South Wales and Victoria over the year and had made no contribution to output growth for the country as a whole.Resource exports had grown strongly in the December quarter and there were early indications of strength in resource exports in the first few months of 2015. However, lower commodity prices were expected to lead to some reduction in the growth of production, and therefore exports, in 2015, particularly for coal. The data for recent quarters were consistent with the lower exchange rate having provided support to net exports, particularly for services.Recent employment growth had been stronger than a year earlier, but it was still below the growth of the working-age population. Consequently, the unemployment rate had continued its gradual upward trend of recent years, notwithstanding a modest decline in February to 6.3 per cent. Other indicators, such as hours worked and the participation rate, had provided further evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. The various forward-looking indicators were stronger than a year earlier, but remained at levels consistent with only modest employment growth in the months ahead.Members noted that the national accounts measures of wage growth had remained subdued. Combined with some pick‑up in labour productivity growth over recent years, this had meant that unit labour costs had not changed much for about three years. Various measures of inflation expectations had remained slightly below their longer-run averages.Financial MarketsThe Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with the unusual trading in the Australian dollar that occurred in the period immediately prior to the announcement of the Board's decisions in both February and March. Members noted that the illiquid conditions that existed in the foreign exchange market at that time meant that small trades could move the price by relatively large amounts, and that once such movements occurred it would be highly likely that algorithmic trading strategies would exacerbate such movements, particularly given the illiquid environment. Moreover, the occurrence of these movements meant that liquidity was likely to decline further as more liquidity providers pulled back from the market during this window.Members were aware of the investigations currently being undertaken by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and were informed that internal work since the March meeting had not identified any evidence of procedural lapses or conduct that could have led to the early release of relevant information.Global financial markets over the past month had continued to focus on the expected path of US monetary policy as well as the strained relationship between the Greek Government and its creditors.Members noted that projections by members of the FOMC for the path of the federal funds rate had been revised down at the FOMC's March meeting. Those projections remained above market expectations, which had flattened further following the FOMC's reassessment and again after the release of weaker-than-expected employment data for March. Markets expected the first rise in the US federal funds rate to occur towards the end of the year.Members also noted that negotiations between the new Greek Government and the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund were fraught. As a result, there was some risk that Greece would not receive assistance funds in a timely fashion and the government would continue to rely on emergency measures to cover its liquidity needs. Greek banks in particular continued to face deposit outflows and had lost access to private funding markets, and as a result had increased their reliance on ECB funding. On a more positive note, members observed that there continued to be little contagion to other euro area periphery countries.Members were briefed about the ECB's balance sheet expansion in March, mainly reflecting lending to banks under its latest targeted longer-term refinancing operation and the commencement of government bond purchases. The ECB had also announced in March that it would not purchase bonds that carried yields below the rate that it paid on deposits (at present –0.2 per cent), indicating that the ECB would need to buy relatively long-dated German Bunds.Government bond yields in most of the major economies remained at very low levels. They had shown little net change in the United States and Japan, while yields on long-term German Bunds had declined further following the launch of the ECB's sovereign bond purchasing program. Domestically, longer-term government bond yields had also declined and the 10-year Australian bond yield was around its record low, with the spread to US yields close to its lowest level since 2001.There were sizeable rises in equity prices in European and Japanese markets in March, while equity prices in China had increased by 15 per cent over the past month and by 90 per cent since the middle of 2014. In contrast, equity prices in Australia had been little changed in March. Prices of resource stocks remained under pressure.The US dollar had appreciated a little further on a trade-weighted basis over March, taking the rise since July 2014 to 14 per cent. Over the same period, members observed that both the euro and the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 20 per cent against the US dollar. While the renminbi had both appreciated and depreciated at different times since July 2014, these moves had roughly netted out against the US dollar overall and the renminbi had therefore appreciated noticeably against most other currencies. Members also noted that the Australian dollar had recorded an all-time low against the New Zealand dollar.Members concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observations that lending rates for business and housing in Australia had continued to edge down over the previous month, and that financial markets assigned a high probability to a reduction in the cash rate at the current meeting, and an even higher probability to a reduction occurring by the May meeting.Considerations for Monetary PolicyMembers' overall assessment was that the outlook for global economic growth had not changed significantly over the past month and that it would be supported by stimulatory monetary policies and the fall in the price of oil since mid 2014. They observed that the apparent slowing of growth in China, in particular the further deterioration in conditions in the Chinese property market, had placed some additional downward pressure on the demand for steel and on the prices of Australia's key commodity exports. Conditions in global financial markets had remained very accommodative. Changes to the stance of monetary policy by any of the major central banks and further significant developments in Europe had the potential to affect financial market conditions in Australia, including the exchange rate, over the coming year.Data available at the time of the meeting suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow somewhat below trend in the December quarter and into the first quarter of 2015. There had been evidence to suggest that the growth in consumption and dwelling investment had picked up, supported by the very low levels of interest rates. Exports were also growing. However, a significant pick-up in non-mining business investment was yet to occur and several indicators suggested it would remain subdued for longer than had earlier been anticipated. At the same time, the recent declines in bulk commodity prices could, at the margin, lead to a larger-than-expected fall in mining investment and some decline in the production of iron ore and coal. Data for the labour market suggested that the economy was likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time and that labour market conditions were likely to remain subdued. As a result, wage pressures were expected to remain contained and inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next year or so.Members remained alert to the possibility that the low levels of interest rates could foster imbalances in the housing market. The most recent data suggested that activity in the housing market had remained strong, but there had been little change to housing market conditions overall or in the growth of housing credit in early 2015. Although prices continued to rise rapidly in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne, trends elsewhere were more varied. Members noted that the Bank was working with other regulators to assess and contain risks arising from the housing market.Overall, members considered that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative and providing support to the economy. They also acknowledged that a lower exchange rate would help achieve more balanced growth in the economy. Further depreciation of the Australian dollar was likely given the recent declines in key commodity prices.In considering whether or not to reduce the cash rate further at this meeting, members discussed the various channels through which monetary policy was affecting the economy at present, including the asset price and exchange rate channels. In assessing the operation of the cash flow channel in particular, they noted that the responsiveness of borrowers and savers to changes in interest rates and asset prices was unusually uncertain in a world of very low interest rates and high household leverage. Members also saw advantages in receiving more data, including on inflation, to assess whether or not the economy was on the previously forecast path and allowing more time for the economy to respond to the reduction in the cash rate earlier in the year.Taking all these factors into account, the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being, while accepting that further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board would continue to assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased for a second straight month in March on rising gasoline and housing costs, a sign of inflation that should keep the Federal Reserve on course to start raising interest rates this year.
March's broad-based price gains bolster the U.S. central bank's long-held view that inflation will gradually move toward its 2 percent target as the dampening effect of lower energy prices fades.
""The data should allay the disinflation concerns that predominated earlier this year and, on the margin, increase the Fed's confidence that inflation will eventually move toward its target,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in February. In the 12 months through March, the CPI slipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in February.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent in March after a similar rise in February. In the 12 months through March, the core CPI rose 1.8 percent, the largest increase since October.
The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said a rate hike will likely be considered at the June policy-setting meeting.
But a recent raft of weak economic data, including the March nonfarm payrolls report, has left many economists believing that monetary policy tightening will not happen before September.
The economy, however, appears set to rebound from a soft patch in the first quarter. In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index jumped to 95.9 early this month from 93.0 in March.
More consumers believe now is a good time to buy big-ticket household items, as well as automobiles. Consumers' views about buying and selling homes improved significantly, a boost for the housing market.
The overall rise in sentiment bodes well for consumer spending and the economy, which stumbled at the start of the year under the weight of a harsh winter, a resurgent dollar, weaker global growth and a now-resolved labor dispute at West Coast ports.
""The positive momentum in purchasing sentiment suggests consumption should rebound in the second and third quarters of this year and support overall growth in 2015,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies on the upbeat inflation and sentiment data, while prices for U.S. government debt were slightly weaker.
U.S. stocks fell sharply on investor concerns over a clamp-down on margin trading in China and a number of disappointing earnings reports from U.S. corporations.
DOLLAR IMPACT
The rise in inflation, however, may be limited by the strong dollar, which has gained 13 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June.
Economists estimate the dollar could shave half a percentage point off inflation and economic growth this year.
Firming wage growth, however, could mitigate the dollar's impact on inflation.
""But if the core rate is that close to target when it is being constrained by the indirect impact of lower energy prices and the stronger dollar, how high could it get when those transitory effects fade next year?"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 3.9 percent, the largest gain since February 2013, after increasing 2.4 percent in February. Food prices slipped 0.2 percent last month, the biggest drop since May 2013.
Elsewhere, shelter costs rose 0.3 percent and further gains are likely, given rising demand for rental accommodation.

There were increases in prices of new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks and medical care services. Prices for apparel items and household furnishings and operations also rose. Airline fares fell 1.7 percent.

The survey's subindex on business conditions rose to 108.2 from 105.0 in March, while a read on consumer expectations rose to 88.0 from 85.3. The median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for a reading of 105.2 for the conditions index and 87.0 for expectations.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2015 08:42AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims rise; continuing claims lowest since 2000,"WASHINGTON April 16 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend continued to point to a strengthening labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended April 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 280,000 last week. A Labor Department analyst said there was nothing unusual in the state-level data.
Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because moving holidays like Easter and the school spring break can throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up 250 to 282,750 last week. Claims below 300,000 are associated with a strengthening labor market.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 40,000 to 2.27 million in the week ended April 4.

That was the lowest reading since December 2000 and suggested more long-term unemployed are getting jobs.

That brings inbound FDI up 11.3 percent to $34.88 billion for the first quarter.
The data follows a series of disappointing data releases , highlighting flagging domestic fixed asset investment, including in property, and slowing industrial activity.
Foreign investment projects take time to conceive and implement, making FDI a lagging indicator of general confidence, but they have remained strong in recent months nevertheless.
Exceptionally strong growth in FDI inflows in the first two months of the year, including a nearly 874-percent jump for Saudi Arabia and a 367-percent gain for France, were due to one-off deals, commerce ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said in March.
In contrast, March trade data released on Monday was extremely weak, with exports falling 15 percent on the year, the worst performance for March since 2009, in the depths of the financial crisis.
Some analysts have posited a continued seasonal effect from this year's very late Lunar New Year holiday, which fell on February 19th, making it the first in late February since 2007. Chinese economic activity usually recedes during the holiday as factories shut down and workers travel back to their home towns and villages.
Outbound investment for the first three months of the year combined rose 29.6 percent from the same period in 2014 to $25.79.
The government has been encouraging Chinese firms to invest abroad to make them more competitive internationally, utilize surplus capacity, and help slow the rapid build-up of foreign exchange reserves.
Inbound FDI in China rose just 1.7 percent in 2014, the slackest pace since 2012. That weak performance accentuated a cooling economy which is spurring more Chinese firms to plough money into overseas assets - a trend that could soon overtake inbound investment.

Last year, China drew a record $119.6 billion of FDI, while outbound investment rose 14.1 percent to a new high of $102.9 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial output posted its biggest drop in more than 2-1/2 years in March in part as oil and gas well drilling plummeted, highlighting the negative impact of lower crude prices and a strong dollar on the economy.
The dour report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was the latest sign that growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and suggested the U.S. central bank could delay raising interest rates until later this year.
Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint.
""This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.
A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output.
Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.
Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by ""multiple"" regions.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.
Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production.
""We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008.
Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter.
U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
WEAK MANUFACTURING
For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009.
Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter.
While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009.
The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March's 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December.
The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute.
Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag.
The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States' main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike.
""The dollar's strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at
MUFG Union Bank in New York.
""Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity. Our guess remains the economy comes back strong later on this spring.""
Companies like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.

Total inflation is at 1%, reflecting the drop in consumer energy prices. Core inflation has remained close to 2% in recent months, as the temporary effects of sector-specific factors and pass-through of the lower Canadian dollar have offset the disinflationary forces from slack in the economy.
The Canadian economy is estimated to have stalled in the first quarter of 2015. The Bank’s assessment is that the impact of the oil price shock on growth will be more front-loaded than predicted in January, but not larger.
Real GDP growth is projected to rebound in the second quarter and subsequently strengthen to average about 2.25% on a quarterly basis until the middle of 2016.
In conclusion, policymakers judged that ""the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate.""

Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.
Manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent. Utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, reversing February's 5.7 percent increase. A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent last month.

For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a more than 60 percent annual rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2015 04:18AM ET</span>","China growth slowest in six years, more stimulus expected soon","By Kevin Yao and Koh Gui Qing
BEIJING (Reuters) - China grew at its slowest pace in six years at the start of 2015 and weakness in key sectors suggested the world's second-largest economy was still losing momentum, intensifying Beijing's struggle to find the right policy mix to shore up activity.
Measures to support the property sector and a series of cuts in interest rates and bank reserve requirements look to have delivered less support to the economy than hoped, apart from feeding a stock market surge, raising expectations of more stimulus soon.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annual 7.0 percent in the first quarter, slowing from 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, China's statistics bureau said. While matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll, some analysts said it seemed stronger than data on the components of growth suggested.
""Despite a headline growth rate in line with expectations, underlying economic activities appear to have softened further,"" Qu Hongbin, HSBC (LONDON:HSBA)'s co-head of Asian Economic Research, said in a note.
""We expect policy makers to deploy further monetary easing and other growth-supporting measures in the coming weeks."" 
Analysts calculated the GDP deflator had fallen 1.2 percent, a six-year low, indicating broad deflationary pressures.
Monthly retail sales, industrial output and fixed asset investment data released with the GDP figures all missed analyst expectations. Growth in fixed-asset investment (FAI), a key economic driver, was the slowest since 2000, while industrial output grew at its weakest since the global financial crisis in 2008.
Power output, which some analysts use as a proxy for economic activity, fell an annual 3.7 percent in March, the biggest fall since the 2008 crisis. 
More bad news came from the real estate sector, a major economic pillar and where investment rose an annual 8.5 percent in the first quarter, the weakest rate since 2009. 
""If you look at Q1, exports were poor, industrial production was poor, FAI was much slower, retail sales soft, so how can GDP in real terms still be 7 percent?"" said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa in Hong Kong.
The National Bureau of Statistics did not release a breakdown of the GDP data, saying the final figures were not yet available.
WEAKEST SINCE GLOBAL CRISIS
It was China's weakest expansion since the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial crisis saw growth tumble to 6.6 percent. A massive stimulus package pulled China out of the slump, but saddled local governments with a mountain of debt.
Sheng Laiyun, the spokesman at the statistics bureau, sought to allay fears that the slowdown was getting out of hand.
""The risk of the Chinese economy having a 'double dip' or a 'hard landing' is very small,"" he told reporters, adding that China would meet its 2015 GDP growth target of around 7 percent.
The stock market (SSEC) (CSI300), which has surged about 70 percent since Beijing began cutting rates in November, ceded early gains to be down 0.9 percent. Mainland investors have tended to see weak data as strengthening the case for easier policy and cash injections, some of which flow into shares.
And many analysts did see further easing as imminent, as Wednesday's data followed figures showing a fall in exports in March and slower-than-expected growth in money supply.""We maintain our forecasts of one interest rate cut in the second quarter and two additional reserve requirement ratio cuts, with the risk of more,"" economists at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) said in a note. 
DEFLATION RISKS
Chinese leaders, while emphasizing the need for slower but better-quality growth, have made clear they would not tolerate widespread job losses, a danger that is contained for now. A survey-based unemployment rate was flat at 5.1 percent, Sheng from the statistics agency said, unchanged from 2014.
Yet some analysts warned this could change if deflationary risks push firms to shed more jobs, and if Beijing carries out threats to allow more companies fighting overcapacity to fail.
""This is an economy in need of substantially easier financial conditions,"" Westpac economists said in a note.
""Lower benchmark lending rates, in addition to a more energetic quantitative effort from the People's Bank of China, should come into play without undue delay.""

1695,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 15, 2015 01:45AM ET</span>",China’s Economy Slows Down,"By Duncan Hewitt -

China’s economy grew by 7 percent in the first quarter of the year, its slowest growth rate since the first quarter of 2009, at the start of the global financial crisis. The GDP figures, announced by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), represented a sharp fall from growth of 7.3 percent in the final quarter of 2014.
The data confirmed predictions of a slowdown, caused in part by a drop in exports over the past month and a slump in investment linked to the real estate market. Quarterly growth was 1.3 percent, below expectations and down from 1.5 percent in the final quarter of 2014. Factory output and retail sales also came in below expectations, at 5.6 percent and 10.2 percent respectively.
The NBS said residential property sales were down 9.3 percent year-on-year, profits in the industry were down 4.2 percent, and unsold inventory increased 24.6 percent. While property investment rose 8.5 percent in the first quarter, this was the slowest growth rate since 2009. Land purchases, an important source of revenue for local governments, were down 32.4 percent in the first quarter, while new construction starts fell 18.4 percent. Fixed asset investment continued to rise faster than GDP, by 13.5 percent, but the figure was slightly lower than some analysts had predicted, according to Reuters.
However ANZ Bank analysts Hao Zhou and Li-Gang Liu predicted that there would be a strong increase in investment in the second quarter, due partly to seasonal cycles in the months after the Chinese New Year vacation. In a research note, they also suggested that property-easing measures would help to “modestly” boost growth.
China’s central bank has reduced interest rates twice since November, and cut the bank reserve ratio, while the government has also made it easier for home buyers to get housing loans. Some analysts predict that the latest figures make further cuts likely. However, with the government seeking to reduce bad bank debt, ANZ Bank’s Zhou and Liu predicted that there would not be an “aggressive” policy easing, and maintained their forecast that China’s economy would grow by 6.8 percent in 2015, below the government’s target of “around 7%.”
Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS, said at a seminar in Beijing on Tuesday that a major stimulus, in the style of China’s massive post-crisis fixed asset investments of 2009, was not necessary. But she said that tax cuts and more open markets would benefit areas like ""transport, the rebuilding of urban shantytowns and the telecommunications expansion.""
China’s Premier Li Keqiang said at the same seminar that the data for the first quarter was “not pretty,” and acknowledged that “downward pressure” on the economy was increasing. He said China's economy was “in the midst of a transition” away from “consumption and investment” but that “new forces” were not yet compensating. However he stressed that the Chinese economy had “great potential, and resilience” and called for more overseas investment to find “new space” for growth.
Some experts, however, have said the latest figures are a sign that China should focus on stimulating its domestic economy, in particular consumption. “The slowdown in exports is in line with global trade conditions – the market for increased exports is just not there,” said independent analyst Andy Xie, former chief economist for Asia Pacific at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Some analysts have seen a positive indication of pent-up demand in the recent boom in the stock markets in China and Hong Kong -- with both Shanghai and Hong Kong hitting seven-year highs. The Chinese government's moves to allow people to open more trading accounts are expected to fuel the boom further.
However, Xie said that while “juicing up the market” might temporarily bring more money into local government and business coffers, to make up for slumping land and real estate sales, it would not solve fundamental economic problems. He warned that it risked “stoking up a stock market bubble to replace the real estate bubble.”
Rather than boosting fixed asset investment, Xie called on the government to cut taxes and, in particular, social welfare fund contributions.
""Social fund contributions amount to forty per cent of the total labor cost,"" he told International Business Times. ""What’s the point of collecting all this money? We do not need extra savings - why not just slash the contributions by half so that people have more consumption power?”"
