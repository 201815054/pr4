In an event held in Bloomington, Minnesota, the Minneapolis Fed president said that the economy was expected to grow at a moderate pace this year.
Kashkari was also confident that the inflation would rise to the Fed’s 2% target as increases in employment thanks to the growing economy would push prices up.
In regard to the recent decreases in the price of crude, Kashkari commented that if the lower prices were sustained, consumers should increase their spending.
In any case, the Minneapolis Fed chief admitted that there were upside and downside risks to his outlook."

Though Carney’s testimony to the U.K. Treasury Committee on Tuesday was meant to explain to MPs about the February inflation report where the BoE cut its UK growth forecast and suggested that interest rates may not increase in 2016, recent pound weakness refocused attention on the European Union (EU) referendum that will take place June 23 to decide if Britain will remain in the EU or cancel its membership.
Though the first question to Carney centered on the possibility of the U.K. leaving the EU, also known as “Brexit”, the committee chairman Andrew Tyrie warned that he did not want the hearings to spend much time on the issue since the BoE governor would testify on that topic on March 8.
Uncertainty over the outcome of the referendum vote hit the pound on Monday after London mayor Boris Johnson stated that he would back the Out campaign and cable hit a seven-year low.
Carney seemed to shrug off recent movements in sterling and insisted that the BoE would not speculate on the results of the referendum.
The central bank will treat the vote “exactly like we treat any other political event”, explaining that the BoE would monitor market developments and factor those effects into its models.
Carney further specified that forecasts of the value of the pound were not factored into the bank’s models.
However, the BoE governor did recognize recent developments in currency markets: “Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals: buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection.”
Carney compared the recent move to when the Scottish referendum took place and noted that cable seems to have been the most affected.
With regard to monetary policy, Martin Weale, external member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), noted that the recent weakness in the pound could increase inflation via exports.
MPC external member Gertjan Vlieghe added that, apart from the expected increase in inflation, the weakness should also boost growth.
Vlieghe also admitted the possibility of increased uncertainty by households and businesses that could delay or reduce their spending.
“So far we haven’t seen very clear evidence of that, but we are watching very carefully,” he said.
BoE’s next policy decision is scheduled for March 17.
Sterling continued to show weakness as the testimony progressed.
At 11:19AM GMT or 6:20AM ET, GBP/USD traded at 1.4116 compared to 1.4120 before the start of the hearings.
EUR/GBP moved to 0.7798 from the previous 0.7795.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors dropped from 53.6 in January to 53.0 in February, a 13-month low and below forecasts for 53.3.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.0 this month, the lowest in 12 months and down from a final reading of 53.6 in January. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 53.3 in February.
Meanwhile, the flash services purchasing managers’ index declined to a 13-month low of 51.0 this month from 53.2 in January, missing expectations for a reading of 52.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Manufacturing output showed the smallest increase since December 2014, moving closer to stagnation amid a further faltering in growth of new orders and exports. Services fared better, though nevertheless saw growth weaken to the slowest since January of last year.
Moreover, a sharp deterioration in optimism about future activity growth in the services sector points to further weakness in coming months.
Deflationary pressures meanwhile intensified. Average prices charged by companies for their goods and services fell at the steepest rate for a year as firms competed to boost sales.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, “Disappointing PMI survey data for February greatly increase the odds of more aggressive stimulus from the ECB in March.”
“Not only did the survey indicate the weakest pace of economic growth for just over a year, but deflationary forces intensified. Economic growth is likely to slow below 0.3% in the first quarter unless we see a sudden uplift in March, which on the basis of the forward-looking components of the PMI seems unlikely,” he added.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.1090 from around 1.1087 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7832 from 0.7820 earlier.

Service providers saw the fastest rise in new business for three months, but manufacturing new orders rose to the least extent since July 2015. Some manufacturers highlighted difficulties in securing orders from foreign clients, and new export business increased only marginally over the month.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2016 04:12PM ET</span>",Firming U.S. inflation keeps Fed rate hike on the table,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising rents and healthcare costs lifted underlying U.S. consumer price inflation in January by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years, providing support for the view that the Federal Reserve could gradually raise interest rates this year as forecast.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.3 percent last month, the biggest gain since August 2011, following a 0.2 percent rise in December.
""This was a firm, broad-based rise in core inflation that should dispel the notion, evident in market-based measures of inflation compensation, that the economy can't generate any inflation,"" said Omair Sharif, rate sales strategist at SG Americas Securities in New York.
In the 12 months through January, the core CPI advanced 2.2 percent, the largest rise since June 2012 and exceeded the 1.9 percent average annualized increase over the last 10 years.
The core CPI was up 2.1 percent in December from the year earlier. The Fed has a 2.0 percent inflation target and monitors a price measure that is running well below the core CPI.
The overall CPI was unchanged in January after slipping 0.1 percent in December. The CPI increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through January, the biggest rise since October 2014, after gaining 0.7 percent in December.
The year-over-year inflation rate is rising as the slump in world oil prices in the past year is washing out of the calculation.
POLICY MAKERS DREAM
Falling commodity and stock prices in the past few weeks, along with slowing domestic and global economic growth, had undermined market expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate rises this year ahead of the central bank's next policy meeting on March 15-16.
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in December, the first rate hike in nearly a decade.
While Fed officials have worried about inflation being too low, they have also maintained that the factors holding back inflation are transitory.
But the rise in the core CPI in January, together with a tightening labor market, suggest further monetary policy tightening this year cannot be ruled out.
""It is a policymaker's dream come true, they wanted more inflation and they got it. The stronger inflation report puts a rate hike back on the table at the March meeting,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
U.S. stock prices dipped on Friday, hurt by a drop in oil prices, and yields on shorter-dated U.S. Treasury debt rose, with investors digesting the inflation data that could raise prospects for further interest rate hikes this year. The U.S. dollar slipped against the euro and yen though.
CORE INFLATION BOOSTED BY RENT AND MEDICAL COSTS
Underlying inflation was last month boosted by a 0.3 percent increase in tenants' rent, which followed a similar gain in December. Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent, with prices for prescription drugs also increasing 0.5 percent.
The cost of doctor visits edged up 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in December and hospital costs rose 0.4 percent.
Apparel prices shot up 0.6 percent, the largest gain in two years, after falling for four straight months. The increase in apparel is surprising as retailers have been offering deep discounts to sell unwanted inventory.
Prices for new motor vehicles advanced 0.3 percent. There were increases in the cost of tobacco and recreation, but prices of household furnishings dipped.
Though some economists were skeptical that the rise in core CPI would be sustained, revisions to the inflation data showed underlying inflation a bit firmer in the last months of 2015 than previously reported.
Following the strong core CPI reading, economists said they expected the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, to increase 0.2 percent in January after slipping 0.1 percent in December.
The core PCE was forecast rising 1.6 percent in the 12 months through January after increasing 1.4 percent in December. The Commerce Department will release the January PCE data next Friday.

24,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2016 09:42AM ET</span>","Fed moves will be gradual, policy accommodative for some time –Mester","Investing.com - Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester reiterated on Friday that normalization of the US central bank’s monetary policy would be gradual as the economy continues to grow.
In a speech delivered in Florida, Mester expressed her belief that the U.S. economy would be able to weather current headwinds and that inflation would drift back to the Fed’s 2% target for the medium-term.
“When oil prices and the dollar both regain some stability, and with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic growth continuing, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just might take a bit longer now, given the most recent decline in oil prices,”.
Mester noted that slow growth outside the U.S., dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector were some of the current forces still impacting the economy and stated that they explained why Fed monetary policy would “likely need to remain accommodative for some time to come”.
Furthermore, Mester reiterated that economic projections constantly needed to be adjusted due to the wide range of deviation.
“Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less gradual or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today,” she explained.
The Fed’s next policy decision meeting will take place on March 15 and 16 and will be accompanied by updated forecasts from its members as well as a posterior press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2016 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. core consumer prices post largest gain in four-and-a-half years,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising rents and medical costs lifted underlying U.S. inflation in January by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years, signs of an uptick in price pressures that could allow the Federal Reserve to gradually raise interest rates this year.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.3 percent last month. That was the biggest gain since August 2011 and followed a 0.2 percent rise in December.
In the 12 months through January, the core CPI advanced 2.2 percent, the largest rise since June 2012. The CPI had increased 2.1 percent in December. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and monitors a price measure that is running well below the core CPI.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core CPI up 0.2 percent last month and increasing 2.1 percent from a year ago.
Inflation is being watched for clues on whether the Fed would continue raising interest rates this year after the U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Tighter financial market conditions in the wake of a recent sharp stock market sell-off and slowing domestic and global growth have almost wiped out bets for a March rate increase.
Signs of a pick-up in underlying inflation are likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials, but significant gains remain a challenge against the backdrop of very low inflation expectations by households.
Still, the firming in the core CPI, together with a strengthening labor market suggest rate hikes for the rest of the year remain on the table.
The overall CPI was unchanged last month after slipping 0.1 percent in December. The CPI increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through January, the biggest rise since October 2014, after gaining 0.7 percent in December.
The year-over-year inflation rate is rising as the oil price-driven weak readings in 2015 wash out of the calculation.
The government on Wednesday published revisions to the inflation data going back five years. Those revisions showed both the monthly CPI and core CPI readings a bit firmer in the last months of 2015 than previously reported.
Last month, the rental index increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in December. Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent, with prices for prescription drugs also increasing 0.5 percent. The cost of doctor visits edged up 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in December. Hospital costs increased 0.4 percent.
Apparel prices rose 0.6 percent after falling for four straight months. The increase in apparel is surprising as retailers have been offering deep discounts to sell unwanted inventory. Prices for new motor vehicles advanced 0.3 percent.

Gasoline prices fell 4.8 percent, while food prices were unchanged.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices remained flat from a month earlier in January, compared to expectations for them to repeat the decline of 0.1% registered in December.
Year-over-year, consumer prices were 1.4% higher from the same month a year earlier, above expectations for a 1.3% increase and after having risen 0.7% in December.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, above forecasts for a gain of 0.2%. Core CPI rose 0.2% in December.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.2% last month, slightly above expectations for a 2.1% rise.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to labor market strength that keeps Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on the table this year.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracting at a slower pace in February and hinted at a pick-up in wage growth. But the signs of stabilization in the struggling manufacturing sector were tempered by further declines in new orders and employment.
""The economy is better than the markets think. We wouldn't rule out another rate hike at the March meeting as financial market turbulence fades away and the economic outlook remains positive,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Economists had forecast claims rising to 275,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 8,000 to 273,250 last week.
In a second report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business activity index increased to a reading of -2.8 this month from -3.5 in January. The index has been now been negative for six consecutive months.
The reports had little impact on U.S. stocks, which slipped after Walmart (N:WMT) reported a drop in quarterly earnings and cut its full-year forecast. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
The health of the job market could determine whether the Fed raises rates this year. The U.S. central bank increased its benchmark overnight interest rate in December, the first hike in nearly a decade. 
Bets for a March rate increase have largely been eliminated against the backdrop of tightening financial market conditions and worries about the U.S. and global economies. 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said on Wednesday it would be ""unwise"" to continue raising rates, given the recent stock market turmoil and falling inflation expectations.
EYE ON LAYOFFS
Claims are being closely monitored for signs of a pick-up in layoffs in the wake of the recent massive stock market sell-off. There is no indication so far that companies have responded to the tighter financial market conditions by reducing headcount. 
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market, for 50 straight weeks - the longest stretch since the early 1970s. The claims data covered the survey period for February's nonfarm payrolls.
The four-week average of claims declined by 12,000 between the January and February survey periods, suggesting an acceleration in job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 in January. Economists said the drop in claims during the survey was consistent with job gains of about 200,000 in February.
""With anxiety around the state of the global economy already elevated and mixed readings across a number of domestic economic indicators, the recent decline in jobless claims is a welcome development,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
A third report showed the Conference Board's leading economic index fell in January for a second straight month because of the stock market volatility. 
The economy is being buffeted by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut manufacturing. Sharp spending cuts by energy firms in response to lower oil prices, and business efforts to sell off inventory have also hurt growth. 
The Philadelphia Fed survey showed factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware continued to report shrinking orders and inventories this month. While shipments grew, the pace slowed significantly from January and delivery times were even shorter than in the prior month.
Though factories reported a decline in employment and hours worked, firms expected employee compensation - wages and benefits - to rise by 3 percent over the next four quarters.

""These numbers would back up the Fed's claim of labor shortages driving up labor costs and shrinking margins. We will see, considering most in the survey also expect to cut employee hours and not add workers,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production in January rose by the most in 14 months as manufacturing and utilities output increased, the latest sign the economy regained some ground early in the year.
While other data on Wednesday showed a surprise decline in housing starts last month, that was probably because of bad weather, especially in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the country. With building permits ahead of groundbreaking activity, home construction is likely to pick up in the months ahead.
The first increase in industrial output in five months should help allay the fears of a recession that have roiled the stock market and eliminated bets for an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in March. The chances of an increase in borrowing costs this year hang in the balance.
""If we step back and view the economy from afar, we see that consumers are spending, manufacturing is beginning to rebound and housing, though not great, is hardly weak. The domestic economy is fine,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
Industrial production jumped 0.9 percent last month, the largest gain since November 2014, the Fed said. The increase followed a 0.7 percent decline in December and was boosted by a 0.5 percent advance in manufacturing output.
The rise in manufacturing production reflected gains in the output of long-lasting goods such as machinery, furniture and primary metals. Motor vehicle assembly accelerated. The production of food, textiles and chemicals also rose. 
But manufacturing is not out of the woods and will continue to be buffeted by a strong dollar, weak global demand and lower oil prices.
Industrial output was also buoyed by a 5.4 percent surge in utilities production as the return to normal winter temperatures saw a jump in demand for heating. Mining output was flat after four straight months of hefty declines that averaged about 1.5 percent per month.
""This bounce is not terribly surprising because the economy is still growing and it fits with our call that eliminating the risk of a March rate hike was a mistake,"" said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York.
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 26-27 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials were concerned about slowing global growth and the equities rout, and considered changing their planned path of interest rate increases in 2016.
U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, while U.S. stocks were trading higher and on course for a third straight day of gains. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
The fairly upbeat industrial production report added to data last week showing strength in consumer spending in suggesting that economic growth picked up early in the first quarter after abruptly slowing in final months of 2015.
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisors raised its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.1 percent rate on the industrial production data.
WEAK HOUSING STARTS
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking activity on new housing projects fell 3.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.099 million units last month. Starts dropped in the Northeast, which was blanketed by snowstorms last month, and also tumbled in the Midwest.
Building permits dipped 0.2 percent to a 1.202 million-unit rate last month. Permits remain above starts, indicating that building activity will rebound in the coming months. 
In addition, housing market fundamentals remain strong, with a tightening labor market starting to push up wage growth.
""We continue to believe that the housing market will be one of the bright spots for the domestic economy in 2016 ... reflecting stronger job growth, increased household formations and the current paucity of supply, particularly in the new home market,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Expectations that interest rates are likely to remain lower for longer should also support demand.""
In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index edged up 0.1 percent in January as the cost of services increased, after slipping 0.2 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, the PPI decreased 0.2 percent after declining 1.0 percent in December. 
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services advanced 0.2 percent. The so-called core PPI rose 0.8 percent in the 12 months through January. Overall, inflation is currently running below the Fed's 2 percent target.

""The rate of PPI inflation has picked up. The question is whether it will pick up enough to push consumer inflation toward 2 percent,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The modest acceleration in the index is a step in the right direction, but not yet cause for confidence the Fed can reach its inflation goal.""

66,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2016 02:36PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers discussed changing interest rate path: minutes,"By Jason Lange and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve policymakers worried last month that tighter global financial conditions could hit the U.S. economy and considered changing their planned path of interest rate hikes in 2016.
""If the recent tightening of global financial conditions was sustained, it could be a factor amplifying downside risks"" to the economy, according to the minutes of the U.S. central bank's Jan. 26-27 policy meeting released on Wednesday.
Most policymakers still expected to lift rates and even discussed whether a hike was warranted in January, but after a
lengthy discussion on global risks they said tighter financial conditions may be ""roughly equivalent"" to further hikes.
Policymakers discussed ""altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate,"" according to the minutes.
However, they agreed it would be premature to change their outlook for the U.S. economy, saying they would closely monitor global economic developments as well as oil and stock prices.
That suggests the recent slowdown in global growth and steep stock market drops are leading the Fed to consider backing away from the signal it sent in December that it could raise rates four times this year.
""A number of participants were concerned about the potential drag on the U.S. economy from the broader effects of a greater-than-expected slowdown in China and other (emerging
market economies),"" according to the minutes.
Wall Street is generally skeptical the Fed will raise rates at all this year. Prior to the release of the minutes, prices for fed funds futures implied investors saw a roughly 40 percent chance of a hike in December and less than that for prior meetings, according to CME Group (O:CME).
Global financial markets have remained volatile since the Fed's January meeting and pushed Mexico, one of America's top trading partners, to raise interest rates on Wednesday to counter a weakening of the peso against the dollar.
In the minutes, policymakers noted that China's problems could weigh on Mexico and Canada, another top U.S. trading partner.
At the time of the January meeting, oil prices still were dropping sharply, but on Wednesday they rose as much 7 percent after Iran voiced support for a Russia-Saudi-led move to limit production.
The minutes also showed the Fed's policy-setting committee reauthorized foreign currency swap arrangements with a number of other central banks.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week the central bank still expected to raise rates gradually but acknowledged a weakened global economy and a steep slide in stock markets was tightening financial conditions faster than the Fed wants.
"
67,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2016 02:30PM ET</span>","FOMC concerned with slowing global economic conditions, minutes show","Investing.com -- When the Federal Reserve last met in January, it acknowledged that uncertainty in global financial markets and concerns with inflation expectations compelled the U.S. central bank to leave its path for future interest rate hikes unchanged, the minutes from its January meeting showed on Wednesday.
Citing projections for weak economic growth and sluggish inflation projections, the Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% last month. It came roughly one month after the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy on December 16, by increasing the rate 25 basis points in a historic decision.
While the FOMC noted that conditions in U.S. labor markets, along with household spending and business fixed income had improved during the intermeeting period, the Fed expressed worries that the improvements were offset by disappointing U.S. manufacturing data and weak economic growth in China, among other concerns.
""Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the beginning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time,"" the minutes showed. ""Some observed that, even with these risks taken into consideration, the federal funds rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a sufficient length of time, and that it might be appropriate to begin policy firming in the near term.""
Before the release, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president Neel Kashkari indicated on Wednesday morning that a March rate hike will still be on the table if the economy continued to grow moderately and inflation moved back toward the Fed's targeted goal of 2%. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Labor said its Producer Price Index (PPI-FD) for January rose 0.1%, exceeding expectations for a decline of 0.2%. The Core PPI, which strips out food and energy prices, increased by 0.6% on an annual basis, extending gains from December when it rose by 0.3% over the previous 12 months.
In its December projection, the FOMC estimated that long-term inflation will increase to 1.6% by the end of 2016, before increasing moderately a year later. Still, the FOMC said two months ago that it does not expect inflation to reach its 2% objective until the end of 2018.
“Since January, the data has been mixed. We’re going to keep watching the data and decide in March or beyond when is the right time to move”, Kashkari told CNBC.

72,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2016 08:45AM ET</span>","U.S. housing starts, building permits fall in January","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in January likely as bad weather disrupted building projects in some parts of the country, in what could be
a temporary setback for the housing market.
Groundbreaking fell 3.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.099 million units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Part of the decline in starts could be attributed to the snowstorms, which blanketed the Northeast last month. 
December's starts were revised down to a 1.143 million-unit rate from the previously reported 1.15 million-unit pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.17 million-unit pace last month.
The report comes on the heels of a survey on Tuesday showing confidence among homebuilders fell in February amid concerns over ""the high cost and lack of availability of lots and labor.""
Builders were less optimistic about current sales.
Still, the housing market fundamentals remain strong, with a tightening labor market starting to push up wage growth.
Though residential construction accounts for a small fraction of gross domestic product, the decline in starts at the beginning of the year suggests that an anticipated rebound in economic growth will be modest.
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after consumer spending moderated and a strong dollar hurt exports. Gross domestic product growth was also restrained by efforts by businesses to sell inventory and cuts in capital goods spending by energy firms.
GDP growth estimates for the first quarter are currently around a 2 percent rate. 
  In January, single-family housing starts, the largest segment of the market, fell 3.9 percent to a 731,000-unit pace.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese banks armed with fresh lending quotas extended a record 2.51 trillion yuan ($385.40 billion) of new loans in January, far more than markets had expected, suggesting Beijing is keeping monetary policy loose to counter a protracted economic slowdown.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected new yuan loans to surge to a near seven-year high of 1.8 trillion yuan in January, tripling from 597.8 billion yuan in December.
Analysts attributed the lending spike to increased injections by the central bank ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in early February, a traditional tendency among Chinese banks to ""front load"" loans at the start of a year and companies reducing their exposure to foreign-currency loans.
""Chinese banks expanded their balance sheet aggressively in the first month of this year, which implies implicit support from the government to counter the economic slowdown,"" said Zhou Hao, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) Asia senior emerging markets economist in Singapore.
Analysts also attributed the surge in new loans to soaring demand for mortgages as property prices recover and government steps to fast-track infrastructure projects to spur activity.
While economists have sometimes speculated that big swings in China's credit data were linked more to speculative activity, the latest data appeared to suggest solid demand in the real economy. Medium-and long-term loans to households were up 45 percent in January from the same period a year ago while such loans to companies jumped 73 percent.
Total social financing, another important indicator of China's credit expansion, rose to 3.42 trillion yuan in January from 1.82 trillion yuan in December.
Part of that may reflect massive infusions of cash into the banking system by the People's Bank of China ahead of the long holiday to avert any risks of a cash crunch. The PBOC injected 1.53 trillion yuan via its standing lending facility (SLF), medium-term lending facility (MLF) and pledged supplementary lending (PSL).
Some economists believe the PBOC is currently favoring liquidity injections as a policy tool rather than long-expected cuts to its policy interest rate and bank reserve ratio requirements (RRR), which authorities worry could put further depreciation pressure on the yuan currency <CNY=CFXS>.
According to sources, Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant governor at the PBOC, has said the central bank would not rush to cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves, as doing so could send a strong signal on policy easing.
MORE EASING?
But while the central bank may shun further cuts in its main interest rate and RRR in the near term, it may still have to ease policy again, analysts say.
The PBOC has cut its policy rate six times since November 2014 and reserve requirements several times, but both remain relatively high, giving it plenty of room.
""As capital outflows continued, we believe that the PBOC will still need to lower the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) to permanently inject liquidity into the economy,"" wrote ANZ economists in a research note, noting that a further cut in RRR was still possible in the first quarter.
Bank lending usually spikes in China in January as banks, which face limits on how much they can lend each year, squeezes much lending as possible into the first month to protect their market share.
The spike in new loans in January also could be due to Chinese companies making early repayments of their foreign-denominated loans and bonds to reduce their currency exposure after the yuan weakened, analysts say.
China Eastern Airlines (HK:0670) said last month it had recently repaid $1 billion worth of dollar debt to reduce its exposure to currency volatility.
Broad M2 money supply (M2) in January also rose to a 19-month high of 14.0 percent in January from a year ago, beating expectations of 13.4 percent and December's 13.3 percent.
The world's second-largest economy grew 6.9 percent in 2015, its weakest in a quarter of a century, as activity was weighed down by sluggish demand at home and abroad, massive industrial overcapacity, cooling investment and a weak property market.
Even with more rate cuts, economists see growth cooling further to 6.5 percent this year, and some market watchers believe real growth levels may already be much weaker.

Others PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department)Anthony Dickman (Secretary)
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion of economic developments by focusing on the domestic economy. They noted that conditions in the labour market had improved while GDP looked to have continued growing at a below-average pace over 2015. The unemployment rate declined to 5.8 per cent in December, employment grew at an above-average rate over 2015 and the participation rate was on an upward trend. The national accounts for the September quarter, released the day after the previous meeting, indicated that GDP growth had picked up as expected in the September quarter, partly because net exports had rebounded following weather-related disruptions in the June quarter. More recent data on activity and trade suggested that output growth had eased in the December quarter and remained below-average in year-ended terms.
Members noted that there had been further evidence of activity rebalancing away from the resources sector towards non-resource sectors. Output growth in the services sector, particularly household services, had been strong. The relatively labour-intensive nature of this growth suggested that compositional change may help to reconcile a rise in employment growth to an above-average rate, on the one hand, and output growth remaining below average, on the other. Also, low growth in labour costs was likely to have contributed to an improvement in Australia's international competitiveness and encouraged businesses to employ more labour than otherwise. Members observed that growth in goods-related production appeared to have picked up recently, but remained modest.
Turning to developments in the household sector, members noted that growth in household consumption had increased in the September quarter to be close to its decade average in year-ended terms. Growth was expected to be similar in the December quarter, based on recent retail sales data, indications from the Bank's retail liaison that trading conditions had improved in the Christmas and post-Christmas sales period, and surveys suggesting that perceptions of households' own finances remained above average. Household consumption growth had been supported by low interest rates, lower petrol prices and increasing employment, despite relatively subdued household income growth. These factors were expected to support a further increase in consumption growth over the forecast period.
Members observed that although the saving ratio had been declining, recent revisions to national accounts data suggested that this decline was not as pronounced as previously thought. As a result, the saving ratio had remained close to 10 per cent over the past five years, which was a significant step up from its average over the previous two decades but not particularly high from a longer-run perspective.
Dwelling investment had increased strongly over the year to the September quarter and further growth was anticipated, albeit at a gradually declining rate. This was consistent with building approvals, which were at a high level, although lower than in early 2015. Members noted that some other indicators of dwelling investment, including loan approvals for new construction, had been more positive in recent months. Information from liaison contacts indicated that demand for high-density housing in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been sufficient to absorb the increase in the supply that had come onto the market, whereas demand had been somewhat weaker in Perth, which had experienced a decline in prices and rents for apartments over the past year. To date, there had not been any substantive signs of financial distress from developers, but there had been an increasing number of projects put on hold, particularly in areas where there were concerns about potential oversupply. Conditions in the established housing market more generally had eased in recent months. Housing prices had declined a little from September 2015 and auction clearance rates had fallen from very high levels to around their long-run averages.
Housing credit growth overall had stabilised at around 7½ per cent, following a period of rising growth since late 2012. Growth in credit to investors in housing had declined, offset by an increase in growth in credit to owner-occupiers. This was consistent with the larger increase in mortgage rates for investors and the strengthening of banks' non-price lending terms in response to earlier supervisory actions.
As expected, mining investment had fallen sharply in the September quarter and further large falls were anticipated. Members noted that the largest subtraction from GDP growth from falling mining investment (net of imports) was expected to occur in 2015/16. Resource export volumes had continued to rise over 2015 as more projects reached completion. Iron ore exports, particularly to China, had remained at a high level and were expected to continue to make a positive contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period. The ramp-up in LNG exports was expected to gain pace over the course of 2016, although some projects had experienced delays in bringing production on line. The scope for additional growth in coal exports appeared limited, given the low level of coal prices. Meanwhile, net service exports had risen further in response to the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate and were expected to continue supporting GDP growth over the forecast period.
The forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised down a little as a result of lower commodity prices over recent months. Members recognised that the outlook for commodity prices and the domestic terms of trade would depend on the outlook for the Chinese construction and industrial sectors – and global industrial activity more generally – and on the responsiveness of the supply of commodities to the decline in prices seen to date. Oil prices had fallen markedly over recent months in response to further increases in supply, though weaker demand was likely to have had some effect as well. Current low oil prices were having a marked effect on capital investment across the industry, particularly in countries with high production costs. Members noted that further increases in supply were expected over time from countries such as Iran, but that lower prices were likely to put more pressure on higher-cost producers.
Non-mining investment had been little changed over the previous year. Indicators of future non-residential building activity, including the stock of work yet-to-be-done and private non-residential building approvals, had declined to relatively low levels. In contrast, survey measures of non-mining business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run average levels and growth in business credit had picked up over 2015. Non-mining business investment was forecast to pick up in the second half of the forecast period, reflecting the increase in domestic demand and competitiveness from the depreciation of the exchange rate to date.
Members noted that underlying inflation had increased to around ½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 2 per cent in year-ended terms, which was much as had been expected. The consumer price index (CPI) had increased by 0.4 per cent (in seasonally adjusted terms) in the December quarter, following the low outcome in the previous quarter, to be 1.7 per cent higher over 2015. This relatively low annual rate partly reflected lower fuel prices as well as the decline in some utilities prices in the September quarter.
Non-tradables inflation (excluding utilities) edged down in the December quarter to be below its inflation-targeting average in year-ended terms. Inflation in new dwelling costs had eased over the past couple of quarters, from its very strong pace in early 2015. The general decline in domestic inflationary pressures was consistent with heightened competitive pressures, declines in the cost of business inputs, such as fuel and some regulated utilities, and low wage growth owing to spare capacity in the labour market.
The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) increased in the December quarter to be slightly higher over the year. Members noted that, although the depreciation of the exchange rate had been passed through to the prices of imports ‘across the docks’, the prices of consumer durables in the CPI had risen by less than expected from historical experience. One explanation was that upward pressure from the depreciation of the exchange rate had been offset over recent quarters by heightened competitive pressures, including from new entrants in some parts of the retail sector. Nevertheless, gradual pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation was expected to place further upward pressure on the prices of tradable items over the next few years.
Members noted that the forecast for GDP growth was little changed compared with the usual range of uncertainty. The forecast for the unemployment rate had been lowered, consistent with the recent unanticipated strength in the labour market, yet the level of the unemployment rate and the prevalence of low wage growth suggested that there was still spare capacity in the labour market. Members noted that the strength of employment over the past year in conjunction with below-average GDP growth created some uncertainty about the outlook for the labour market. Underlying inflation was forecast to remain low over the forecast period, underpinned by the expectation that domestic inflationary pressures would remain subdued, although the effects of the exchange rate depreciation on consumer prices would exert some upward pressure on inflation.
International Economic Conditions
Members noted that growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a bit below its decade average over 2015 and was expected to remain around this pace over the forecast period. The US, Japanese and euro area economies had continued to expand over 2015, while growth in the rest of Asia, most notably China, had slowed. Growth in global industrial production and trade volumes had generally been weak, although services-sector activity had been more resilient. Lower oil prices and accommodative monetary policies in most economies were expected to continue supporting global growth. Globally, inflation had remained low and well below most central banks' targets.As had been the case for some time, growth in China was expected to ease further over the forecast period. To date, the moderation of growth had largely been the result of lower investment growth as a consequence of excess capacity in heavy industry and the large stock of unsold housing, while activity in the services sector had been relatively resilient. However, a range of longer-term structural factors, such as declining growth in productivity and in the urban working-age population, were also playing a role. Although deflationary pressures persisted in the industrial sector, housing prices had increased slightly over the past year, largely owing to increases in the larger cities. Members noted that the potential interaction between slowing growth, low inflation and high – and increasing – levels of debt was an important source of uncertainty around the outlook for the Chinese economy. Members agreed that the authorities still had scope to respond if the economy turned out to be much weaker than expected. However, any sharp slowing in economic activity in China could spill over to other economies in the region and adversely affect commodity prices, including those that are important for Australia.
Industrial activity and exports in Japan and the rest of the east Asian region had been subdued, in part reflecting the region's exposure to the Chinese economy. As a result, GDP growth was expected to be below its decade average in the rest of east Asia in 2015. Members noted that Japanese and euro area GDP had only recently returned to 2008 levels. In contrast, the US economy had been growing at an above-trend pace for some time, which had contributed to the significant decline in the US unemployment rate. Private consumption had been the key driver of expenditure growth in the United States, supported by improvements in the labour market and lower oil prices. Overall business conditions and activity had been generally positive, although the industries most exposed to oil prices and the appreciation of the exchange rate had experienced subdued conditions. Members observed that unemployment rates had also declined in Japan and the euro area. While nominal wage growth remained low in most economies, according to some measures it had risen in both the United States and Japan. In the three large advanced economies, inflation remained low.
Financial Markets
The first tightening of US monetary policy in nearly 10 years and a further easing of monetary policy in the euro area and Japan had taken place since the previous meeting. Members noted that, although the tightening of US monetary policy was widely expected and absorbed by markets, including in emerging economies, the divergence in monetary policy between the United States, on the one hand, and the euro area and Japan, on the other, had continued to influence exchange rates.
In December, the Federal Open Market Committee had projected around 100 basis points of tightening during 2016, but at that time market pricing embodied only 50 basis points and since then expectations had been scaled back further, with markets currently not pricing in any further increase until the end of 2016.
The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of measures in December to ease policy further, including lowering the interest rate on its deposit facility to ‒30 basis points, citing concerns about the downside risks to the inflation outlook. The package of measures was, however, less stimulatory than markets had expected, which led to a sharp appreciation of the euro. The ECB had subsequently indicated that there was a possibility of further stimulus being announced at its next meeting in March, and markets had priced in another cut in the deposit rate at that time. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) surprised markets in late January with a reduction in the rate of interest on marginal reserves to −10 basis points, the first time this rate had been negative. The introduction of a new tiered system of interest rates was designed to minimise the effect of negative interest rates on the banking system. The current pace of balance sheet expansion by the BoJ was expected to continue over 2016, with total assets projected to equal around 90 per cent of GDP by the end of the year. Japanese government bond yields fell sharply after the monetary policy announcement by the BoJ, reaching a new low of 5 basis points.
Members noted that there was little volatility in financial markets immediately following the much-anticipated increase in the federal funds rate. Sentiment deteriorated early in the new year as concerns about China intensified and there were renewed declines in oil prices. These developments contributed to sharp declines in equity and corporate bond prices, declines in sovereign bond yields and depreciations of the currencies of a range of commodity exporters. Spreads on non-investment grade corporate bonds issued by energy and other resource-related companies increased sharply following the falls in oil and other commodity prices.
One aspect of market concern was uncertainty about the Chinese authorities' intentions for the future value of the renminbi, which had depreciated against the US dollar but had remained relatively stable in trade-weighted terms over the past year. Large capital outflows from China and the associated significant decline in Chinese foreign exchange reserves in the past few months, as well as asset sales by the sovereign wealth funds of oil-producing nations, appeared to have contributed to market volatility. Members noted the challenges for the Chinese authorities in managing the exchange rate in the face of depreciation pressure from private capital outflows.
Global share prices fell by almost 10 per cent over January, with a strong correlation with the fall in oil prices. Chinese equity markets fell particularly sharply amid uncertainty about the economic outlook and the possible policy reactions of the authorities. Australian equity prices also fell, although not to the same extent as overseas markets, with prices of resources sector shares having fully retraced all the gains relative to other sectors of the market over the past decade and a half. There was a small fall in Australian equity prices over 2015.
In foreign exchange markets, sizeable movements in exchange rates had been prompted by the deterioration in risk sentiment and divergence in monetary policy stances in the major economies. There had been a significant depreciation of the yen following the policy announcement by the BoJ. The currencies of most Asian and Latin American emerging market economies had continued to depreciate over the past couple of months. The Australian dollar had depreciated slightly against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the previous two months.
Funding costs for Australian banks had increased a little from their low levels recently, reflecting higher short-term wholesale funding costs both in offshore and domestic markets. The cost of new long-term wholesale funding had also increased, but remained below the cost of maturing debt. Members noted that an important issue was the extent to which higher wholesale funding costs led to a rise in deposit rates.Domestically, members noted that pricing in financial markets indicated that there was no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the present meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent domestic data had, on balance, been positive and judged that there were reasonable prospects for growth to increase gradually over the forecast period while maintaining inflation close to target. Employment growth over 2015 had been stronger than earlier expected and the starting point for the forecast for the unemployment rate was around ½ percentage point lower. Inflation continued to be relatively low, with underlying measures of inflation at about 2 per cent over 2015. Growth in labour costs also remained quite subdued.
There continued to be evidence that very low interest rates were supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment and that the depreciation of the exchange rate was boosting demand for domestic production as it adjusted to the evolving economic outlook. Resource exports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth. Although commodity prices and mining investment had fallen further, the drag on GDP growth from this source was expected to lessen a little over 2016/17. Members observed that leading indicators of investment intentions had continued to suggest that there was little prospect for a pick-up in non-mining business investment in the near term, although surveys of business conditions were at above-average levels and the pace of lending to businesses had picked up. Credit growth to households remained at a moderate pace, albeit with a change in composition between investors and owner-occupiers, following supervisory changes to emphasise prudent lending standards.
Data on international economic conditions suggested that growth in Australia's major trading partners was likely to be sustained around its current pace. The recent increase in financial market volatility owed in part to uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth, particularly China, much of which arose from concerns about the capacity of policymakers to respond effectively to the array of challenges they faced. Members noted that global growth would be supported by accommodative monetary policies and lower oil prices, but that inflation generally continued to be lower than central banks' targets. In addition, funding costs for high-quality borrowers remained very low.
Based on the available data and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation, members judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at an accommodative setting. Over the period ahead, new information would enable the Board to assess whether the recent improvement in labour market conditions was continuing and whether recent financial market turbulence presaged weaker global and domestic demand. The Board noted that the outlook for continued low inflation may provide scope for easier monetary policy, should that be appropriate to lend further support to demand.
The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

The Cabinet Office reported that gross domestic product contracted by an annualized 1.4% in the three months to December, worse than expectations for a contraction of 1.2%, following a revised 1.3% expansion in the second quarter.
Business spending rose 1.4% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, but private consumption, which makes up 60% of GDP, dropped 0.8%, the report said.
For 2015 as a whole, Japan’s economy expanded just 0.4%, as a 2.7% increase in exports helped offset a 1.2% drop in private consumption.
The weak data underlined the difficulties facing policymaker’s efforts to boost inflation in the world’s third-largest economy.
Last month the Bank of Japan shocked markets with a decision to adopt negative interest rates amid concerns that slowing growth in China amid heightened volatility in global markets will add to the risk of deflation."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending regained momentum in January as households ramped up purchases of a variety of goods, in a hopeful sign that economic growth was picking up after slowing to a crawl at the end of 2015.
But the outlook for consumer spending was tempered by another report on Friday showing sentiment among households ebbed in early February. Still, the increase in consumer spending last month underscored the economy's resilience and challenged the view that a recession was looming.
""The markets may have decided that the U.S. is headed for recession, but obviously no one told U.S. consumers,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.6 percent last month after an unrevised 0.3 percent decline in December.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales increasing 0.3 percent last month.
U.S. stocks, which had been aggressively sold this week on concerns the economy was heading into recession, rallied on the data. Market sentiment was also buoyed by a rebound in oil prices from 12-year lows.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while the dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies.
Though signs of firming consumer spending are likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials, the stock market turmoil and tame inflation environment make it unlikely the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates next month. Rate hike prospects for the rest of the year have also diminished.
The Fed raised its short-term interest rate in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.
""From the Fed's perspective, any further evidence of the U.S. economy weathering the market turmoil at the start of the year is confirmation the Fed should continue to focus on the longer run and ignore short-term disruptions,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages. Savings, which hit a three-year high in 2015, are seen boosting future spending.
Q1 GDP ESTIMATES RISE
Growth in consumer spending moderated in the fourth quarter. That, together with weak export growth due to the strong dollar, efforts by businesses to sell inventory and cuts in capital goods spending by energy firms, restrained GDP growth to a 0.7 percent annual pace.
However, weak reports on inventories, factory orders and construction spending suggest the economy grew at about a 0.2 percent rate in the last three months of 2015.
In the wake of the retail sales report, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2 percent annual rate, and economists at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) lifted their forecast to a rate of 1.5 percent from 1.2 percent.
A separate report showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to a reading of 90.7 in early February from 92 in January as households worried about the economic outlook.
Consumers, however, remained upbeat about their personal financial situation and anticipated that low inflation would boost their purchasing power. Consumers expect inflation to average 2.4 percent over the next five years, down from 2.7 percent in the January survey and the lowest reading since the question was added to the monthly survey in 1990.
""The Fed closely watches the consumer survey measures of inflation expectations, and while today's data is only the preliminary report, it does increase the risk that the Fed's next hike is delayed beyond our current June call,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
Inflation, which is currently running below the Fed's 2 percent target, could remain benign. The Labor Department reported on Friday that import prices dropped 1.1 percent in January after a similar decrease in December. Import prices have declined in 17 of the last 19 months, reflecting the robust dollar and plunging oil prices.
While lower oil prices have translated into cheaper gasoline, boosting household discretionary spending, they are also weighing on sales at service stations.

In January, a 3.1 percent drop in receipts at service stations restricted the gain in overall retail sales to 0.2 percent. Retail sales for December were revised to show a 0.2 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip.

""We will be examining new information over the months ahead as we try to discern the answers to these and other questions,"" Stevens said in a statement before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. He later added that the cash rate is unlikely to go higher anytime soon and then suggested the question is whether it would go lower than the current record low 2%.
""With inflation unlikely to cause a problem by being too high over the next year or two the statement after the recent meeting indicted that the board retains the flexibility to ease further should that be helpful,"" Stevens said.
It will take time to see if recent financial turbulence will have a materially negative effect on aggregate demand at home and overseas, Stevens said.
""The more recent anxiety is probably best described as greater uncertainty over the intentions of Chinese policymakers and over whether they will be able to carry off the economic transition China needs. This anxiety has been reflected in capital flows,"" he said.
Another question is what the recent unexpected strength in the labor market means for the outlook,"" Stevens said. ""If it turns out that the strength is just temporary then the outlook is still for moderate growth - but no near-term acceleration. If, on the other hand, recent trends were to continue, the income gains coming from higher employment may start to feed into stronger demand growth - which would probably lead in due course to higher levels of investment,"" he said.
""Alternatively, if demand growth were to be in areas that require relatively little capital to support the labor employed then the apparentweakness in capital spending outside mining could be of less concern,"" Stevens said.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2016 03:52PM ET</span>",Low U.S. jobless claims underscore labor market strength,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting the labor market remains on solid footing despite slowing economic growth and a stock market rout.    
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 269,000 for the week ended Feb. 6, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast claims falling to only 281,000 in the latest week. 
The drop pushed down claims to near their post-recession lows around 256,000, pointing to very low layoffs even as the domestic economic outlook becomes increasingly uncertain.
""The economy might be sailing into a storm, the financial markets say, but if so, the U.S. economy is in a very strong position to weather whatever comes, with the labor market the strongest in decades,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at 
MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The report was overshadowed by escalating fears over global growth, which sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note plunging to a more than three-year low. U.S. stock indexes fell more than 1 percent. 
The dollar fell to a 15-month low against the yen as the darkening global growth outlook and equities sell-off reduced the possibility of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year. Prices on fed fund futures, used to predict future U.S. policy rates by the Fed, surged across the board.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December, the first hike in nearly a decade. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Thursday the central bank was evaluating the global financial market and economic developments, but said ""at this point I think it's premature to make a judgment.""
TEMPORARY RISE
Claims drifted higher at the start of the year. That had raised concerns that the headwinds of a strong dollar, weak global demand and spending cuts in the energy sector, which have constrained growth, could be spilling over to the labor market.
""It appears that at least some of that deterioration was related to temporary factors including an unfavorable shift in the weather and perhaps layoffs of temporary workers following the holiday season,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a bettermeasure of labor market trends as it smoothes week-to-week volatility, fell 3,500 to 281,250 last week. 
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with strong labor market conditions, for 49 straight weeks - the longest spell since the early 1970s. 
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased 151,000 in January, while the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent for the first time in eight years. 
A report on Tuesday showed Americans growing more confident in the labor market, with the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs hitting a nine-year high in December.
""Thus far, there is no sign that the volatility in markets has produced a rise in layoffs,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 21,000 to 2.24 million in the week ended Jan. 30.

Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 281,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 48 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended January 29 fell to 2.239 million from 2.260 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to drop to 2.250 million.
The four-week moving average was 281,250, a decline of 3,500 from the previous week's 284,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Receipts last month totaled $314 billion, while outlays stood at $258 billion.
Increased receipts of individual and social insurance taxes contributed to the surplus, a Treasury official said.
Differences in monthly calendar adjustments, including $42 billion in outlays as a result of a benefits payments shift into December 2015, also contributed to the surplus.
Accounting for those adjustments, the January surplus was $15 billion, compared to an adjusted $2 billion surplus in the same month a year ago.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2016 03:31PM ET</span>",More Americans quitting jobs as labor market strengthens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged in December and the number of Americans voluntarily quitting work hit a nine-year high, pointing to labor market strength despite a slowdown in economic growth.
The signs of a robust jobs market could ease concerns about the health of the economy, which were underscored by other reports on Tuesday showing a drop in small business confidence in January to a two-year low and further declines in wholesale inventories.
""If the labor market is tightening, can the economy really be faltering?"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 261,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.61 million in December, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). It was the second highest reading since the series started in 2001.
The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Federal Reserve officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation.
The increase lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent in November. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent, indicating that employers were having trouble finding qualified workers for vacant positions.
A total of 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs in December, the highest number since December 2006. That pushed the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, to 2.1 percent - the highest level since April 2008.
The dollar pared losses against the yen after the data, while U.S. stocks briefly reversed losses. Prices of long-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
The report came ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on Wednesday. A raft of weak economic reports, plummeting oil prices and a stock market sell-off have raised doubts as to whether the U.S. central bank will hike interest rates this year.
The Fed raised its overnight benchmark interest rate in December, its first hike in nearly a decade. The economy, however, has been undermined by a strong dollar, sluggish global demand and an effort by businesses to sell off inventory.
Ongoing capital spending cuts by energy firms also are weighing on growth.
SLACK BEING REDUCED
""Skeptics may argue that these (JOLTS) numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
""This is certainly a risk and one important reason why the Fed is currently sitting back and waiting. But why should this happen now when it hasn't over the past several months? After all, oil prices started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015.""
The number of unemployed job seekers per open job, a measure of labor market slack, fell to 1.4 in December, the lowest level since March 2007 and down from 1.5 in November.
""Diminishing labor market slack has led to a modest increase in wage growth, evident across several measures of worker compensation,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York. ""We expect that wage growth will continue to move up gradually, helping core inflation return toward target once the headwinds from lower import prices subside.""
While a separate report from the National Federation of Independent Business showed its Small Business Optimism Index fell 1.3 points to a two-year low of 93.9 in January, businesses continued to report tightening labor market conditions.
Small businesses reported a shortage of qualified workers to fill job openings, prompting some to start raising wages to attract and retain them. The share of small businesses raising compensation increased to its highest level since 2007.
""The combination of more job openings and more people quitting could result in pay increases, and we have seen a few other signs that wages have increased as the labor market has tightened,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
Wage growth, which has been frustratingly slow, picked up significantly in January. Still, growth in average hourly earnings is yet to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say wages need to grow between 3 percent and 3.5 percent to lift inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.
In a third report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories dipped 0.1 percent in December after dropping 0.4 percent in November.
The weak inventory data added to soft December construction spending and factory orders reports in suggesting that fourth-quarter GDP growth could be revised down to an annual rate of about 0.4 percent from the 0.7 percent pace reported last month.

The government will publish its second GDP growth estimate later this month.

In a report, the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.607 million in December from 5.346 million a month earlier. Analysts had expected the number of job openings to rise to 5.400 million.
The report has garnered more attention lately, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen often cites the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.

The trade in goods narrowing was mainly the result of a fall in the import of goods of £1.7 billion to £33.0 billion, mainly reflecting a fall in imports of unspecified goods, which decreased by £1.0 billion to £0.4 billion.

""Now is the defining moment for Japan's economy to maintain momentum so as not to halt the virtuous cycle. The bank should reinforce QQE and increase available options for further easing in the future by implementing additional measures in order to sustain credibility for monetary policy,"" the summary said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but surging wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday. The growth in January payrolls was a sharp step-down from the average 231,000 jobs per month during the fourth quarter.
""The fact that payroll gains fell back to earth is not necessarily a bad sign. Most indications are that the job market in the U.S. is on solid footing and improving,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 in January and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent. The economy added 2,000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported.
On top of a 0.5 percent jump in average hourly earnings, which was the biggest gain in a year, employers increased hours for workers. Manufacturing, which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand, added the most jobs since August 2013.
Economists said the combination of solid wage growth and falling unemployment suggested a March interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve could not be completely ruled out.
The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies on the data after hitting a roughly 15-week low on Thursday. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell as did stocks on Wall Street.
""The lower unemployment rate and rising wages further support the view that the labor market is doing nothing but tightening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Clearly, there are more uncertainties today than when the Fed raised rates in December and hinted that there could be four increases this year. But the labor market is absolutely not one of them.""
Tightening financial market conditions and signs that both the domestic and global economies were slowing had undercut the case for a Fed rate hike next month and lowered the probability of monetary policy tightening this year.
The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
WEATHER PAYBACK
January's softer job gains were payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction. January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers, which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales.
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the buoyant dollar cutting into exports in December, causing the trade deficit to widen 2.7 percent to $43.4 billion.
With its January employment report, the government published its annual ""benchmark"" revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations. It also incorporated new population estimates.
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 206,000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than it had reported. The shift in population controls means figures on the labor force or number of employed or unemployed in January are not directly comparable to December.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job was at 62.7 percent, near four-decade lows. Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labor shrinks, unless a strong rise in wages lures more people back into the labor force.
The private sector accounted for all employment gains in January, adding 158,000 positions.
The services sector created 118,000 jobs, the fewest in 10 months. That was because temporary help services fell 25,200 and courier and messenger employment declined by 14,400 jobs. Hiring in these categories normally rises during the holiday season.
Educational services lost 38,500 jobs, but retail payrolls added a strong 57,700 positions. But hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (N:WMT) and Macy's (N:M) announced dozens of store closures.
The embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 jobs last month, while mining laid off 7,000 more workers. Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining.
Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20,246 workers. Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger (N:SLB) to slash their workforces.

Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after adding 146,000 jobs in the fourth quarter. Government employment fell 7,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but surging wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labour market recovery remains firm.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was at 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Data for November and December was revised to show 2,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent.
Also taking the sting from the softer payrolls number, employers increased hours for workers. Manufacturing, which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand, added the most jobs since August 2013.

January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers, which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales.
But coming in the wake of an abrupt slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter and a sharp stock market sell-off, the closely watched employment report could add to concerns the U.S. economic outlook was deteriorating.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population.
Against the backdrop of tightening financial market conditions, the deceleration in employment growth could further undercut the case for a Fed interest rate hike in March. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
FULL EMPLOYMENT
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory.
Even with slower job growth, wages rebounded sharply after holding steady in December. Average hourly earnings increased 12 cents or 0.5 percent. That left the year-on-year gain in earnings at 2.5 percent as the unusually strong wage gains seen in January 2014 dropped out of the picture.
But with the jobless rate in a range most economists associate with full employment, wage growth is expected to pick-up this year.
With its January employment report, the government published its annual ""benchmark"" revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations. It also incorporated new population estimates.
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 206,000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than it had reported. The shift in population controls means figures on the labour force or number of employed or unemployed in January are not directly comparable to December.
The labour force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job was at 62.7 percent, near four-decade lows.
Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labour shrinks, unless a significant rise in wages lures more people back into the labour force.
In January, all the employment gains were in the private sector, which added 158,000 jobs. The services sector dominated the payrolls increase last month, with 118,000 jobs created.
Mining losing lost 7,000 more jobs, while the embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 positions.
Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining.

Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after hefty gains in the fourth quarter. Courier services hiring fell 14,400. Retail employment added a strong 57,700 jobs after shedding 800 positions in December. But hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (N:WMT) and Macy's announced dozens of store closures.

Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, who also won the previous year based in part on confidence in the improving jobs market, says there are few reasons to worry that the fall in unemployment will halt soon or that a recession is near.
His conviction stems from one of the most reliable economic indicators, jobless claims, which is an actual tally of people claiming benefits, not data derived from surveys.
The jobless claims figures have been broadly consistent, he says, and when averaged out, provide a very good guide to the trend in non-farm payroll employment data, which always get the most attention each month from financial markets.
Several times last year, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when there was originally no economic growth reported at all, O'Sullivan said he held his nerve while many others worried the economy was turning down.
""There was a question of how much of it was weather, but hey, maybe not all of it was weather -- and then you got the March and April employment reports which seemed to imply that hey, things are really slowing,"" O'Sullivan said.
""But claims were saying no, don't worry, don't panic, don't extrapolate. And sure enough, payrolls roared back in May and GDP bounced back in Q2.""
After touching a four-decade low, initial weekly jobless claims have edged up, averaging 270,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. The recent rises -- the latest was 285,000 -- do not signal a change in the trend, O'Sullivan said.
This suggests the jobless rate will fall further, and at some point soon, it will start to push up more significantly on already-rising wage inflation.
O'Sullivan warns not to take the disappointing 0.7 percent annualized growth rate reported for the fourth quarter as a leading indicator of where the economy is headed, especially with more than an average 200,000 jobs created each month.
""The employment numbers are telling the right signal. Don't extrapolate a weak GDP number just as you shouldn't have in the first quarter of last year,"" he said.
Monthly payroll growth would need to fall below 100,000 to stop the downtrend in unemployment, according to O'Sullivan.
""And again, that will happen at some point of course, but I just don't see it happening right now.""
His biggest assumption, however, is that financial markets will find their footing after a terrible start to the year. That is by no means guaranteed.

High Frequency Economics topped a list of 60 forecasters in the U.S. that were graded by StarMine for accuracy on a set of key monthly data releases in 2015, including GDP, inflation, consumer confidence, unemployment rate, as well as the purchasing managers' surveys of business activity.

""This suggests that employers will face continued wage and benefit cost pressure in order to attract and keep good employees,"" said NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg.
The average employment gain per firm was 0.11 workers compared with -0.7 workers in December.
In the survey, 29 percent of owners reported jobs openings they could not fill, up one point from the prior survey and the highest level for the economic expansion.
""This is a solid reading historically and is suggestive of a reduction in the unemployment rate"", Dunkelberg said.
Growth in the United States slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and data so far in 2016 has shown that weakening global growth, a strong dollar and slumping oil prices continue to take a toll.

But employment has been a bright spot. Jobs data to be released on Friday by the Labor Department is expected to show non-farm payrolls grew by 190,000 in January, less than the robust 292,000 created in December but consistent with a strong jobs market.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>",Rising U.S. layoffs hint at ebbing labor market momentum ,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, suggesting some loss of momentum in the labor market amid a sharp economic slowdown and stock market selloff. 
Signs of creeping employment weakness were also flagged by another report on Thursday showing a 218 percent jump in announced job cuts by U.S.-based employers in January. The planned layoffs were concentrated in the energy and retail sectors.
""The future is somewhat darker ... the labor market may be past its peak for this cycle. It looks like the labor market has scaled back its rapid advance last month,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 285,000 for the week ended Jan. 30, the Labor Department said. Claims remained below 300,000, a level associated with strong labor market conditions, for a 48th straight week - that is the longest run since the early 1970s.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,000 to 284,750 last week. Economists had forecast claims rising to 280,000 in the latest week.
The rise in layoffs came amid a slowdown in economic growth. The economy grew at only a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, held back by the headwinds of a strong dollar and faltering global demand.
A downturn in capital spending by energy companies, reeling from a collapse in oil prices, and inventory destocking by businesses are also constraining growth. At the same time, a stock market rout sparked by fears of a global economic slump has caused financial market conditions to tighten.
In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said employers reported 75,114 planned job cuts last month, up from December's 15-year low of 23,622. January's planned layoffs were the largest since July.
Retailers announced plans to eliminate 22,246 jobs from their payrolls, the most since January 2009. The retail cuts were dominated by Walmart (N:WMT), which announced plans to close 269 stores worldwide. Firms in the downtrodden energy sector plan to slash headcount by 20,246, up from 1,682 in December.
Some economists downplayed the increase in layoffs, citing the ongoing job losses in the energy industry and the impact of a blizzard that buried the northeastern United States in late January. They also tied the rise to the dismissal of seasonal and temporary workers after the holiday shopping season.
""To date, even taking the recent rise as given, the increase (in claims) is not sufficient to change our view that the expansion remains intact and that the economy is far from recession. Claims are very volatile,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods tumbled 2.9 percent in December, the largest drop in a year, after falling 0.7 percent in November. 
The reports came on the heels of weak data on export growth and consumer spending that suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates in March. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar fell to a more than 3-1/2-month low against a basket of currencies as investors further dialed back their rate hike expectations. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while U.S. stocks were mixed in volatile trading.
PRODUCTIVITY WEAK
While the claims data has no bearing on January's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period, it fits in with perceptions of a deceleration in the pace of job growth. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased 190,000 last month after surging by 292,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast holding steady at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 3.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the biggest drop in more than a year, after rising at a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter.
The weak productivity data reflected the sharp slowdown in GDP growth during the fourth quarter and robust hiring. Nonfarm payrolls rose by an average 284,000 jobs per month during the last three months of 2015.
Productivity grew 0.6 percent in 2015, the smallest gain since 2013, and has increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0 percent in each of the last five years. Economists blame softer productivity on a lack of investment, which they say has led to an unprecedented decline in capital intensity.

In the fourth quarter, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, advanced at a 4.5 percent pace, the fastest rate in a year. They rose 2.4 percent in 2015, the largest gain since 2007.

Market analysts expected the central bank to vote 8-1 to keep policy steady.
The BOE said it was holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.50%, in a widely expected move. The rate has been held at that level since March 2009. The central bank also said it was to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion.
All nine members were in favor of making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.
According to the minutes, “the MPC judges the risks to the central projection to be skewed a little to the downside in the near term, reflecting the possibility of greater persistence of low inflation.”
“Low realized inflation will continue to moderate the increase in wage pressure in the near term,” the minutes added.
Expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of England have been pushed back to early-2017 due to a recent spate of weaker than expected data and amid uncertainty over a referendum on whether or not Britain should stay in the European Union.

198,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Feb 03, 2016 02:10PM ET</span>",The Bank of Japan's New Monetary Policy,"By Vassil Nikolov
The bank's minutes shed light on the board split over the December measures The minutes of the December policy formulated by the Bank of Japan were released on Wednesday. They helped to shed additional light on the internal split over the supplementary measures that were decided at that meeting. However, the skeptics warned about possible drawbacks.
At the December 17-18 meeting, the policy board of the central bank voted 6-3 to enable them to undertake a series of steps aimed at supplementing the massive asset purchase program. The board included an extension of average maturities of the bonds of the Japanese government being bought by the bank for 7-12 years. An extension of the exchange-traded stock funds purchases of the Bank of Japan by Y300 billion per annum.
Some of the board members indicated that measures were required to smooth the asset purchases and dispel fears concerning the sustainability of purchase programs. The minutes indicated that such steps would empower the BOJ to undertake measures of additional easing in a fairly timely manner should that become necessary.
However, one member disagreed, indicating that such a move would cause a misunderstanding among the market participants as the asset purchase program nears its limit.
The central bank avoids identifying board members by name in the minutes customarily.
Since the Halloween easing that took place in October 2014 when Governor Haruhiko Kuroda scraped by with a 5-4 thin margin, the board of the bank has become sharply divided. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister, has tried to tip the balance of a section of the board in favor of the policies formulated by Mr. Kuroda to replace two of the retired board members with those who vehemently support aggressive easing.
The board of the bank appears to have gone through an intense debating session over details of supplementary measures. The majority of the members indicated that the maturity extension of debt purchases was quite necessary for ensuring smooth and flexible conduct of the JGB buying. A few of the members indicated that the bank could manage purchases without making the change.
Some of the members spurned the idea of creating an ETF purchase framework worth Y300 billion in addition to the major ETF buying scheme of Y3 trillion. This was designed to support the companies that were eager to invest and raise employee wages. One member indicated that the BOJ should avoid engaging in measures with features like those of industrial policies as the major characteristic.
At the most recent policy meeting that was held last week, the board of the central bank undertook a clear-cut measure of easing by setting the key interest rate below the zero mark to spur borrowing and lending. Beginning at the middle of this month, the Bank of Japan is expected to impose a negative 0.1% interest rate on a section of yen deposits that are parked by commercial banks at the central bank.
  According to Richard Koo, negative rates are an act of desperation that are born out of despair The negative interest rate policy formulated by the Bank of Japan will not solve the problems of Japan.
The Nomura Research Institute’s chief economist, Richard Koo, says that adoption of negative interest rates by the BOJ is a sign of despair because of the inability of inflation and quantitative easing measures to produce desired results. Lowering the bank’s interest rates is expected to have little effect in the country because many Japanese companies are trying to minimize the level of debt despite them having great balance sheets as a result of dearth of the domestic investment opportunities and debt trauma.
Mr. Koo also points out the fact that the private sector has managed to save a GDP net of 6.7% in 12 months through 2015’s third quarter despite the zero interest rates. Mr. Koo adds that major incentives for driving capital investment will be required to encourage the companies to spend again.

The USD/JPY shows a muted reaction  The USD/JPY is currently showing a somewhat muted reaction to the speech made by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan.
Before the event, the currency was 119.66 but it has since dropped to 119.62. On Friday, the BOJ decided to adopt a negative interest rate to push the reserve rate into the negative territory. The steps taken by the BOJ appear helpless due to pressure from the Chinese economy’s slowdown and the tumble of commodity prices.

Mizuho Bank’s chief economist, Daisuke Karakama, said that they don’t want to welcome extra easing as had been previously experienced in October 2014. This was attributed to the confusion of using negative rates on a section of the yen deposits of commercial banks to the central bank.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2016 01:21PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector cooling; jobs market resilient,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activity in the vast U.S. services sector slowed to a near two-year low in January, suggesting that economic growth weakened further at the start of the first quarter even as the labor market remains resilient.
The economy has been undermined by a strong dollar, softening global demand and an inventory destocking, which have pressured manufacturing and export industries. Spending cuts by energy firms, reeling from a collapse in oil prices, have also dragged on growth.
Until recently, services sector strength had offered hope that the economy would weather both the domestic and global headwinds, which held gross domestic product growth to a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.
""The slowdown in the services sector indicators may go a long way in fanning fears of a more pronounced slowdown to U.S. growth momentum heading into 2016,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 53.5 last month, the lowest level since February 2014, from 55.8 in December.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Service industries reported growth in new orders continued to slow, with export orders contracting last month.
The ISM noted that while the majority of the respondents' comments were positive about business conditions, there were concerns about the global environment, stock market volatility and their impact on commercial and consumer confidence.
Food industries complained about the dollar's strength and wholesalers said the plunge in oil prices was putting ""extreme pressure"" on exchange rates in key export markets. As a result, companies were forced to cut prices to beat competition, which was compressing margins.
Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, hit by a growing glut and cooling economic growth in China and other emerging markets. The dollar has gained 22.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
WEAKNESS SPREADING
A separate survey from data firm Markit also showed moderating services sector activity last month. Markit's U.S. services business activity index fell to 53.2, the lowest level since October 2013, from 54.3 in December. Though still above the key 50 mark, January's reading was also below the average recorded since the survey began in October 2009.
The reports join a raft a weak data ranging from inflation to manufacturing and consumer spending in suggesting the Federal Reserve will probably not hike interest rates in March. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight lending rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar fell to a more than seven-week low against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks were trading lower. Prices for U.S. government debt fell marginally.
""There are more uncertainties out there and that is likely to cause the Fed to be cautious in their drive to normalize,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
With business activity cooling, the ISM survey's employment index fell to a one-year low in January. While this raises the possibility that employment growth slowed in January after non-farm payrolls surged 292,000 in December, there are signs that the labor market remains fairly strong.
In a separate report, payrolls processor ADP said private employment increased 205,000 in January. December's private payroll gains were revised up to 267,000 from 257,000.
The ADP National Employment Report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for total non-farm payrolls to increase by 190,000 in January and the unemployment rate to remain at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent.

Private hiring fell below December's brisk pace because of a slowdown at the largest companies, which more sensitive to current economic conditions than small and mid-sized firms, ADP said.

Xu Shaoshi, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission, unexpectedly disclosed the number at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. He didn't elaborate and and didn't say if this will be the growth target set in the Premier's work report that will be published at the start of the annual meeting of the National People's Congress on March 5.
Li set a growth target of ""around 7%"" for 2015, and the government struggled to meet that even after a series of interest-rate and reserve-ratio cuts last year, along with faster spending on infrastructure and a range of tax cuts and other policies, expansion came in at 6.9%.

He repeated the official view that the underlying price trend has been ""improving steadily"" despite some soft data, Kuroda said in a speech that recent surveys and the outlook based on inflation-indexed bonds is causing him to think ""it is slightly concerning"" due mainly to falling crude oil prices.
The BOJ's aggressive easing since April 2013 has failed to boost inflation from zero to stable 2% as falling energy prices sent the year-on-year change in the core CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, back to zero from a recent peak of 1.5% and wage growth remains slow. Earlier this month in an attempt to jar policy along, the BoJ introduced negative interest rates, surprising markets.
""The commitment by the bank to achieve the price stability target of 2% is firm and unshaken. Given that the central bank is firmly committed to the price stability target and is taking necessary measures as appropriate, the goal will surely be achieve,"" Kuroda said.
""Let me conclude my speech by reiterating what I have repeatedly stated since I took the governorship of the Bank of Japan: The Bank of Japan will do whatever we can to achieve the price stability target of 2%.""

""Members noted that, in pursuing QQE, the bank would examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate,"" the minutes said from at its Dec. 17-18 meeting, referring to the quantitative and qualitative easing launched in April 2013 which so far has failed to boost inflation to the bank's target of stable 2%.
""They then concurred that such adjustments were not necessary at this point, as QQE had been exerting its effects and the underlying trend ininflation continued to improve steadily.""
Only about a month later, the BOJ board decided in a tight 5 to 4 vote to ease policy by adopting negative interest rates to counter unstable stock markets and increased uncertainty over China and other emerging economies. The bank left its target for the monetary base and asset purchases unchanged, however.
""Some members - noting that there was concern among some market participants as to whether it was feasible for the bank to continue purchasing assets - expressed the recognition that the bank should facilitate smoother asset purchases under QQE and dispel such concern by taking measures that would allow it to prepare for the technical obstacle that was anticipated by market participants,"" the minutes said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales fared better than expected in January as the industry continued to benefit from low gasoline prices, easy credit and moderate economic growth, major automakers said on Tuesday.
Sales were down 0.3 percent at 1.15 million vehicles, Autodata Corp said, better than the expected decline of between 0.5 percent to 5 percent forecast by analysts polled by Reuters before Tuesday.
January U.S. sales were 17.58 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, Autodata said. WardsAuto, which the U.S. government uses for economic analysis, said the annualized rate was 17.46 million and that monthly sales fell 0.4 percent from a year ago.
The same trends that boosted sales in 2015 helped blunt the challenges of two fewer selling days and a massive East Coast snowstorm.
General Motors Co (N:GM), the top-seller in the U.S. market, said its sales were up 0.5 percent, while it increased its share of the retail market, which does not include fleet sales to rental agencies.
 Ford Motor Co  's (N:F) sales fell 2.6 percent.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), No. 3 in the U.S. market, showed sales down 4.7 percent.
Results of all of the 10 top-selling automakers in the U.S. market except for Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) topped expectations of forecasters.
 Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) showed sales up 7 percent. Honda Motor Co (T:7267) sales fell 1.7 percent, and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) reported sales up 1.6 percent.  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) sales rose 1 percent.
The month shows a strong start of what is expected to be a second straight record year.
Still, auto company shares remain pressured as many Wall Street investors say the cyclical industry will soon plateau, ahead of a decline in several years.
Ford reported sales of its F-series pickup trucks were down 5 percent, and its shares fell nearly 5 percent. Fiat Chrysler shares traded in New York were down 4.1 percent on Tuesday afternoon and GM shares were down 2.1 percent. The wider S&P 500 index was down 2.1 percent.
WardsAuto said U.S. sales hit a record 17.39 million vehicles in 2015. Some forecasters say 2016 sales will reach 18 million vehicles.
Sales of GM's Chevy Silverado and Fiat Chrysler's Ram both rose 5 percent. Each truck is its manufacturer's best-selling model for the U.S. market.

Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) VW brand sales fell 14.6 percent as it continues to be affected by its diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen AG sales including the VW, Audi and Porsche brands fell 7 percent.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 55.0 last month from a reading of 57.8 in December. Economists had expected the index to decline to 57.5 in January.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
A number of survey respondents noted that softer new business growth had acted as a brake on output growth and staff hiring at the start of 2016.
Civil engineering was again the weakest performing area of activity overall, despite rebounding slightly from December’s eight-month low.
Mirroring the trend for business activity, latest data signalled a slowdown in new order growth at the start of 2016. The latest increase in incoming new work was the slowest for four months.
Survey respondents cited greater caution among clients and less favourable underlying demand conditions.
Commenting on the report, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author the report, said, “U.K. construction firms struggled for momentum at the start of this year, with heightened economic uncertainty acting as a brake on new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since the summer of 2013.”

237,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2016 10:33PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of Australia holds cash rate at 2% as expected,"Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate at a record low 2% Tuesday as expected on Tuesday, signalling scope for easier policy if future economic data warrants such a move.
For the full text release, see below:
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
Recent information suggests the global economy is continuing to grow, though at a slightly lower pace than earlier expected. While several advanced economies have recorded improved growth over the past year, conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate has continued to moderate.
Commodity prices have declined further, especially oil prices. This partly reflects slower growth in demand but also very substantial increases in supply over recent years. The decline in Australia's terms of trade, which began more than four years ago, has therefore continued.
Financial markets have once again exhibited heightened volatility recently, as participants grapple with uncertainty about the global economic outlook and diverging policy settings among the major jurisdictions. Appetite for risk has diminished somewhat and funding conditions for emerging market sovereigns and lesser-rated corporates have tightened. But funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that the expansion in the non-mining parts of the economy strengthened during 2015 even as the contraction in spending in mining investment continued. Surveys of business conditions moved to above average levels, employment growth picked up and the unemployment rate declined in the second half of the year, even though measured GDP growth was below average. The pace of lending to businesses also picked up.
Inflation continues to be quite low, with the CPI rising by 1.7 per cent over 2015. This was partly caused by declining prices for oil and some utilities, but underlying measures of inflation are also low at about 2 per cent. With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world, consumer price inflation is likely to remain low over the next year or two.
Given these conditions, it is appropriate for monetary policy to be accommodative. Low interest rates are supporting demand, while regulatory measures are working to emphasise prudent lending standards and so to contain risks in the housing market. Credit growth to households continues at a moderate pace, albeit with a changed composition between investors and owner-occupiers. The pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney over recent months and has remained mostly subdued in other cities. The exchange rate has continued its adjustment to the evolving economic outlook.
At today's meeting, the Board judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore decided that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate.
Over the period ahead, new information should allow the Board to judge whether the recent improvement in labour market conditions is continuing and whether the recent financial turbulence portends weaker global and domestic demand. Continued low inflation may provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity appeared to stabilize a bit in January, but a recovery is unlikely in the near term as factories grapple with a strong dollar and lower oil prices force energy firms to further cut spending.
Other data on Monday showed consumer spending was flat in December as households reduced their purchases of automobiles and unseasonably mild weather hurt heating demand. However, a jump in savings to a three-year high suggested consumption could rebound in the months ahead.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity increased 0.2 percentage point to a reading of 48.2 last month, the fourth straight month of contraction.
A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing. However, the index remains above the 43.1 threshold which is associated with a recession. 
The buoyant dollar has combined with tepid global demand to undermine U.S. exports. At the same time, businesses are working to reduce a huge pile of unsold merchandise clogging warehouses, which has left little scope to place new orders with factories. Manufacturing accounts for 12 percent of the economy. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending was unchanged in December after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in November. Spending on long-lasting manufactured goods such as autos dropped 0.9 percent. Purchases of nondurable goods also declined 0.9 percent. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was previously reported to have increased 0.3 percent in November. Spending increased 3.4 percent in 2015 after advancing 4.2 percent in 2014.
That data was included in last Friday's fourth-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending growth slowed to a 2.2 percent annual rate from the third quarter's brisk 3 percent pace. 
Moderate consumer spending, weak export growth and the ongoing inventory bloat helped restrict economic growth to a 0.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter. More cutbacks in investment by energy firms struggling with lower oil prices also hurt GDP growth.
But with the labor market strengthening and some of the impediments to growth largely seen as temporary, economists expect output to pick up in the first quarter of 2016. First-quarter growth estimates are for now mostly above a 2 percent rate. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower and the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt also were lower.
ROBUST SAVINGS
In December, income rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in November. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in November. Income in 2015 was up 4.5 percent, the largest increase since 2012, after rising 4.4 percent in 2014. 
Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation in 2015 recorded its biggest increase since 2006.
With income outpacing spending in December, savings surged to $753.3 billion, the highest level since December 2012, from $717.8 billion in November. 
Higher savings and rising house prices should help to soften the blow to household wealth from a recent stock market sell-off and drive spending in early 2016.
With consumption soft, inflation retreated in December.
A price index for consumer spending slipped 0.1 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, however, rose 0.6 percent after increasing 0.4 percent in November. 
That was the largest increase since December 2014. Year-over-year inflation rates are rising as the weak readings during the year drop out of the calculation. 
Excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged after rising 0.2 percent in November. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in November. 
Core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and remains well below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.

249,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2016 04:36AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI rises to 3-month high of 52.9 in January,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the U.K. expanded at the fastest rate in three months in January, due mostly to improved domestic demand, industry data showed on Monday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI  rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.9 last month from a reading of 52.1 in December. Analysts had expected the index to inch down to 51.8 in January.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Manufacturing production increased again during January, reflecting improved inflows of new work from the domestic market. Moreover, the rate of expansion in output accelerated to a 19-month high. The trend in new export orders, however, fell back into decline.
Companies linked lower overseas sales to stronger competition and tough market conditions. Some firms also noted that, despite recent easing, the sterling-euro exchange rate remained an issue impacting on trade flows with the euro zone.
Meanwhile, the ongoing weakness in global commodity prices led to a further substantial reduction in manufacturers’ average purchasing costs during January.
Commenting on the report, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said, “Subdued growth, rising global headwinds and a lack of inflationary pressure provide further cause for the Bank of England to push its first rate increase into the back and beyond of 2016.”
GBP/USD was trading at 1.4305 from around 1.4304 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7580 from 0.7588 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were modestly lower. London’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%, the EURO STOXX 50 declined 0.1%, France's CAC 40 slumped 0.5%, while Germany's DAX slipped 0.45%.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.4 in January, compared to the previous month's reading of 49.7 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters predicted a reading of 49.6, suggesting the sixth consecutive month of contraction.

China's economic growth cooled to 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years, adding pressure to policymakers who are already struggling to restore the confidence of investors after a renewed plunge in stock markets and the yuan currency.

The move was aimed at ensuring that consumers move away from a ""deflation mindset"" and included a statement that lower interest rates on excess reserves would be considered if needed.
The BoJ cited unstable global financial markets and depressed crude oil prices to delay the estimated timing of achieving 2% sustained inflation by six months, the third delay in the past 10 months.
Board member Sayuri Shirai told the two-day board meeting that ended Friday that ""introducing a negative interest rate immediately after the introduction of supplementary measures for QQE (last month) might be misunderstood as reaching a limit to the bank's asset purchases.""
Soon after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda took office, the bank in April 2013 changed its policy framework from targeting zero interest rates to targeting the total sum of money in circulation and deposited at the central bank.
Last month Kuroda said the central bank had no plans to adopt a negative deposit rate policy as a means of enticing lenders to make more loans and push down the yield curve.
""From the BoJ point of view, our QQE is having its intended effects on the economy and financial markets,"" he said during the question and answer session at a seminar on investment.
Banks in Japan have been increasing loans to the real economy and the yield curve, which indicates borrowing costs, has been declining generally, he said.
Despite growing near-term downside risk, the BoJ maintained its view that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2016 12:09AM ET</span>",U.S. economy likely hit a speed bump in fourth quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth likely braked sharply in the fourth quarter as businesses doubled down on efforts to reduce an inventory glut and unseasonably mild weather cut into consumer spending on utilities and apparel. 
Gross domestic product probably rose at a 0.8 percent annual rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists, also as a strong dollar and tepid global demand hurt exports, and lower oil prices continued to undercut investment by energy firms.
The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter. Risks to the fourth-quarter GDP forecast are tilted to the downside after a report on Thursday showed a collapse in new orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in December.
But some of the impediments to growth - inventories and mild temperatures - are temporary and the economy is expected to snap back in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the U.S. Commerce Department's advance fourth-quarter GDP report, to be released on Friday at 08:30 a.m. could spark a fresh wave of selling on the stock market, which has been roiled by fears of anemic growth in both the United States and China.
""Given the state of financial markets, fourth-quarter GDP could fuel fears that the expansion is unraveling. This would be misguided as inventories will be a significant weight and trade will also be drag,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged that growth ""slowed late last year,"" but also noted that ""labor market conditions improved further."" The Fed, the U.S. central bank, raised interest rates in December for the first time since June 2006.
Though the Fed has not ruled another hike in March, financial markets volatility could see that delayed until June. 
""We remain unconvinced that (the slowdown) will develop into a more serious economic downturn,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
""We have already seen a number of temporary dips in GDP growth during this expansion. Nevertheless, each time GDP growth accelerated again in the following quarter and there is no reason to believe this time will be any different.""
SMALL INVENTORY BUILD 
In the fourth quarter, businesses are forecast to have accumulated between $55 billion and $65.9 billion worth of inventory, down from $85.5 billion in the third quarter. Economists estimate the small inventory build will slice off at least one percentage point from the first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is forecast to have increased at around a 1.7 percent rate. That would be a big step-down from the 3.0 percent pace notched in the third quarter.
Unusually mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel in December and undermined demand for heating through the quarter.
With gasoline prices around $2 per gallon, a tightening labor market gradually lifting wages and house prices boosting household wealth, economists believe the slowdown in consumer spending will be short-lived.
""The U.S. consumer is still in a good position to accelerate spending in the quarters ahead,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The dollar, which has gained 11 percent against the currencies of the United States' trading partners since last January, likely remained a drag on exports, leading to a trade deficit that probably subtracted about half a percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
The downturn in energy sector investment probably put more pressure on business spending on nonresidential structures. Oil prices have dropped more than 60 percent since mid-2014, forcing oil field companies such as Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) to slash their capital spending budgets.

With consumer spending softening, inflation likely retreated in the fourth quarter. A price index in the GDP report that strips out food and energy costs is expected to have increased at a 0.7 percent rate, slowing from a 1.3 percent pace in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in December recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, the latest indication that U.S. economic growth braked sharply at the end of 2015.
Despite the slowdown in growth, which was acknowledged by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, the labor market remains on solid ground. Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits retreated from a six-month high last week.
The economy has been blindsided by a strong dollar, spending cuts by energy firms bruised by the slump in oil prices and anemic demand overseas. Business efforts to trim an inventory overhang have also weighed on growth and the outlook has been dimmed by the recent stock market selloff.
The Commerce Department said durable goods orders plunged 5.1 percent last month, the biggest drop since August 2014, after slipping 0.5 percent in November. The decline was generally broad-based, with orders for transportation equipment plunging 12.4 percent and bookings for non-defense aircraft plummeting 29.4 percent.
The drop in aircraft orders is surprising as Boeing (N:BA) received orders for 223 aircraft in December, up from 89 planes the prior month, according to information posted on its website.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders falling 0.6 percent last month.
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, decreased 4.3 percent in December. These so-called core capital goods orders fell 1.1 percent in November.
The decline in orders for both durable and capital goods adds to weak data on retail sales, industrial production, exports and business inventories, suggesting the economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is expected to report on Friday that fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 0.8 percent annual rate after notching a 2 percent pace in the third quarter. There is, however, a risk that output contracted in the fourth quarter.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data on Thursday as traders followed the gyrations in crude oil prices.
WEAK BUSINESS SPENDING
The Fed said on Wednesday ""economic growth slowed late last year"" and noted that business fixed investment has been increasing at a ""moderate"" pace in recent months.
The U.S. central bank left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it was ""closely monitoring global economic and financial developments"" to assess their impact on the labor market and inflation.
The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
While cheap oil has been a boon to consumers, it has eroded the profits of energy companies, forcing oilfield services firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) to cut capital spending budgets.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat, which has undercut growth in new orders. The dollar has weighed on exports.
Pointing to weak business spending, shipments of core capital goods – used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP report – dipped 0.2 percent last month after falling 1.1 percent in November.
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 during the week ended Jan. 23.
The drop, which exceeded economists' expectations for a fall of 282,000, almost reversed the prior two weeks' increases.

It was the 47th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 mark, which is associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest stretch since the early 1970s.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>",Pending home sales almost flat in December,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes barely rose in December, an indication that the housing market remains mixed going into the first quarter of 2016.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its pending home sales index inched up 0.1 percent to 106.8. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8 percent increase in December.
The trade group also said the index declined slightly more in November than initially estimated. Pending home sales were still up 4.2 percent from the same month a year earlier.
In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in mid December, the first time in almost a decade. Mortgage rates initially rose too, but have since dropped below December's levels.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two.
Milder-than-usual temperatures were seen having boosted sales in the northeast of the country, where the index increased 6.1 percent. Contracts fell in the other three main regions.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 0.8%. Pending home sales in November fell by 1.1%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported decline of 0.9%.
The modest uptick was fueled by a large increase in the Northeast that outpaced declines in the other three major regions.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 3.1%, below forecasts for an increase of 4.8% and following a gain of 4.9% in the prior month.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says contract activity closed out the year on stable footing but lost some momentum, except for in the Northeast.
""Warmer than average weather and more favorable inventory conditions compared to other parts of the country encouraged more households in the Northeast to make the decision to buy last month,"" he said.

319,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2016 05:39PM ET</span>",FOMC Monetary Policy Statement - Text,"Investing.com - The following is the complete text of the FOMC statement issued Wednesday.
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.
Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.
Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L. George; Loretta J. Mester; Jerome H. Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2016 05:18PM ET</span>","Fed keeps rates unchanged, wary eye on global markets","By Jason Lange and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it was ""closely monitoring"" global economic and financial developments, signaling it had accounted for a stock market selloff but wasn't ready to abandon a plan to tighten monetary policy this year.
The decision by the central bank's rate-setting committee was widely expected after a month-long plunge in U.S. and world equities raised concerns an abrupt global slowdown could drag on U.S. growth.
Fed policymakers said the economy was still on track for moderate growth and a stronger labor market even with ""gradual"" rate increases, suggesting its concern about global events had diminished but not squashed chances of a rate hike in March.
""The committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation,"" the Fed said in its policy statement following a two-day meeting.
(Statement comparison:
Wall Street fell after the statement, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index closing down more than 1 percent. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were mixed, while the dollar extended losses against a basket of currencies.
In an indication the Fed was taking global risks seriously, a prior reference to the risks to the economic outlook being ""balanced"" was removed from its statement. Instead, it said it was weighing how the global economy and financial markets could affect the outlook.
""It is clear that several FOMC members have become more worried,"" said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit (MI:CRDI) in New York, referring to the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Shrugging off economic weakness in China, Japan and Europe, the Fed last month raised its key overnight lending rate by a quarter point to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent and issued upbeat economic forecasts that suggested four additional hikes this year.
Wall Street's top banks, however, expect only three rate increases before the end of the year, according to a Reuters poll released after the Fed's statement on Wednesday. That was in line with expectations earlier in January.
Investors are betting on one quarter-point rate increase in 2016.
Prices for Fed funds futures on Wednesday showed traders had pushed back bets for the next rate hike to July from June and modestly trimmed bets on a March hike.
""The Fed has maintained its composure in the face of global pressures,"" said Joe Manimbo, an analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.
JOB GAINS
U.S. exports took a hit last year, largely due to the impact of a strong dollar, but consumer spending accelerated and overall employment surged by 292,000 jobs in December.
The Fed said on Wednesday that a range of recent labor market indicators, including ""strong"" job gains, pointed to some additional firming in the job market.
Oil prices have also plummeted this year, which could keep U.S. inflation below the Fed's 2 percent target for longer, but the central bank said it still expects the downward inflationary pressure from lower energy and import prices to prove temporary.

Policymakers will be able to sift through the January and February U.S. employment reports before their next policy meeting in March."
321,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2016 04:52PM ET</span>","Reserve Bank of New Zealand holds steady at 2.5%, moves to easing bias","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left the official cash rate unchanged as widely expected but reverted to an easing bias just one meeting after it changed stance for steady interest rates.
In a statement Thursday, the RBNZ said headline inflation is expected to increase over 2016 but it will now take longer to reach the target range than previously expected, indicating an easing may be required to achieve this earlier.
""Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative. Some further policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range,"" the RBNZ said.
""We will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data,"" the RBNZ said.
Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 2.5 percent.
Uncertainty about the strength of the global economy has increased due to weaker growth in the developing world and concerns about China and other emerging markets. Prices for a range of commodities, particularly oil, remain weak. Financial market volatility has increased, and global inflation remains low.
The domestic economy softened during the first half of 2015 driven by the lower terms of trade. However, growth is expected to increase in 2016 as a result of continued strong net immigration, tourism, a solid pipeline of construction activity, and the lift in business and consumer confidence.
In recent weeks there has been some easing in financial conditions, as the New Zealand dollar exchange rate and market interest rates have declined. A further depreciation in the exchange rate is appropriate given the ongoing weakness in export prices.
House price inflation in Auckland remains a financial stability risk. There are signs that the rate of increase may be moderating, but it is too early to tell. House price pressures have been building in some other regions.
There are many risks around the outlook. These relate to the prospects for global growth, particularly around China, global financial market conditions, dairy prices, net immigration, and pressures in the housing market.
Headline CPI inflation remains low, mainly due to falling fuel prices. However, annual core inflation, which excludes temporary price movements, is consistent with the target range at 1.6 percent. Inflation expectations remain stable.
Headline inflation is expected to increase over 2016, but take longer to reach the target range than previously expected. Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative. Some further policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range. We will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data.

323,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2016 02:07PM ET</span>","FOMC leaves interest rates unchanged, one month after historic rate hike","Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve, as expected, left short-term interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, reaffirming their plan to tighten monetary policy gradually after approving their first rate hike in nearly a decade last month.
Citing weaker global and domestic growth, as well as high volatility in financial markets, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50%. On December 16, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy, aimed at lifting the U.S. economy out of the Great Recession, by implementing a modest hike of 25 basis points.
Since the historic meeting, many analysts have downgraded their global macroeconomic outlook, as the continual downturn in oil prices and the weakest annual GDP growth in China in a quarter century has stoked fears of a worldwide slowdown. Although the U.S. labor market has grown at a steady pace over the last three months, long-term inflation, the second leg of the Fed's dual mandate, remains far below its objective. Last month, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that its Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items declined 0.1%, slightly below forecasts for a flat reading. Meanwhile, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index, hovered at 1.3% in November, sharply under the Fed's targeted goal of 2%. The Core PCE index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation.
In one notable change, the FOMC removed a phrase that it is ""reasonably confident"" inflation will move toward its 2% objective from the statement. The minutes from the December FOMC meeting showed that the Fed does not expect long-term inflation to reach the target until 2018.
Also in December, the Fed projected that the upper range of the Fed Funds Rate will reach 1.4% by the end of 2016, suggesting the possibility of up to four rate hikes this year. On Wednesday, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the implied probability of a 25 basis point hike by the FOMC in March at 26.7%, when the U.S. central bank is scheduled to meet next. Heading into the release, the odds of a March rate hike, according to the CME Group, were fairly higher at 30.3%.
Over the last month, the FOMC has employed two instruments, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Operations or reverse repo's and interest payments on excessive reserves held at the New York Fed, to help stabilize the Fed Funds Rate. Minutes before the statement was issued, the Fed Funds Rate stood at 0.38%, up considerably from an average rate of 0.13% one year ago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 100 points in the minutes following the release to 16,069, down 98.20 or 0.61% on the session, while the S&P 500 Composite index fell slightly to 1,898.91, down 4.30 or 0.20% on the day. Both indices extended the losses in the final hour of trading, closing the session down 223 and 20 points respectively.
The relatively dovish statement had little impact on the U.S. Dollar Index, which fell by percentage points to 99.06, down 0.05%. EUR/USD inched up to 1.0880, up 0.10%, extending modest gains from earlier in the session.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell mildly to 2.011%. Minutes before the release, bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries stood at 2.043%, up four basis points on the day."

There are, however, signs the malaise from manufacturing and export-oriented industries is starting to filter into the services sector, with data on Tuesday showing activity in that vast sector hit a one-year low in January.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 98.1 this month from 96.3 in December as households shrugged off January's stock market sell-off and focused instead on a strengthening labor market.
""Households remain quite upbeat about the economic prospects and, given the importance of consumer spending to overall domestic activity, the resiliency in household sentiment will be seen by the Federal Reserve as good news,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy U.S. chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumers remained optimistic about the labor market this month. The share of households anticipating more jobs in the months ahead increased 13.2 percent from 12.4 percent in December, while the proportion of those anticipating fewer jobs fell slightly.
Though the share of consumers expecting an increase in incomes rose to 18.1 percent from 16.3 percent last month, there was a slight increase in those expecting an income reduction.
Other details of the report showed the proportion of consumers claiming jobs are 'plentiful' fell to 22.8 percent from 24.2 percent in December. However, fewer households believed jobs were 'hard to get,' a sign the labor market continued to tighten.
Labor market strength, marked by a 5 percent unemployment rate, prompted the Fed to raise interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. The U.S. central bank is due to announce its latest rate decision at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) on Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting.
While stock market volatility has diminished the chances of another rate hike in March, economists expect the Fed will increase borrowing costs in June.
A separate report showed the S&P/Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.8 percent in the year to November, adding to a 5.5 percent increase in October.
House prices rose 0.9 percent in November from October on a seasonally adjusted basis. Home prices in Dallas, Denver and Portland, Oregon are now at record levels, the report showed.
Still, home prices nationally remain 4.8 percent below their record level from July 2006, before the housing market crash, although they have climbed 29.2 percent from their post-recession bottom in January 2012.
""While continued price increases will begin to impact affordability, they are necessary to encourage sellers to list their homes for sale,"" said Kristin Reynolds, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""Improving demographics and higher incomes, in combination with moderate price appreciation and inventory expansion, are consistent with our expectation for continued balanced improvement in the housing market.""
SOFT PATCH
U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, buoyed by a recovery in oil prices and better-than-expected quarterly profits from 3M Co (N:MMM) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG). The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government debt fell.
The economy has hit a soft patch as dollar strength, spending cuts in the energy sector and faltering global demand undercut manufacturing, mining and export-oriented sectors. Efforts by businesses to reduce an excessive inventory build has also put pressure on economic activity.
The drag from these sectors appears to be spilling over to the services industries. In a third report, financial data firm Markit said its flash U.S. services PMI business activity index slipped to 53.7 this month in January, the weakest reading since December 2014, from 54.3 in December.
While service sector firms continued to report improving domestic economic conditions and rising client demand this month, some suggested that spending cutbacks across the energy sector had a negative impact on their business activity.
The survey also showed some firms complained the buoyant dollar remained a headwind to growth at the start of 2016.
""Up until a few months ago, it had seemed that the weakness in the economy was isolated in certain areas, mainly energy, manufacturing, and exports. The recent deterioration in the services PMI is an unfavorable development,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.

In a fourth report, the Philadelphia Fed said its non-manufacturing business conditions index fell three points to 21.4 in January. Firms reported a decline in new orders received, shrinking order books and sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rebounded strongly in December from a 19-month low and prices surged, indicating the housing market recovery remained intact despite signs of a sharp deceleration in economic growth in recent months.
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales jumped a record 14.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.46 million units, after being temporarily held back by the introduction of new mortgage disclosure rules, which had caused delays in the closing of contracts in November.
Sales were also boosted by unseasonably warm weather. November's sales pace was unrevised at 4.76 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales rebounding 8.9 percent to a 5.20-million rate.
Sales rose 6.5 percent to 5.26 million units in 2015, the strongest since 2006. Last month's snap-back suggests that
November's slump was a blip and should offer some assurance that domestic demand remains fairly healthy, even as growth appears to have braked sharply at the end of 2015 because of a downturn in manufacturing and mining activity.
""While the carryover of November's delayed transactions into December contributed to the sharp increase, the overall pace taken together indicates sales these last two months maintained the healthy level of activity seen in most of 2015,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.
Housing is being supported by a strengthening labor market, which has resulted in an acceleration in household formation. Sales, however, remain constrained by a dearth of homes available for sale, which is limiting choice for buyers.
The economy has been hammered by a strong dollar, slowing global demand and deep spending cuts in the energy sector. Businesses are also placing fewer orders with factories while trying to reduce piles of unsold merchandise, which also is putting pressure on the economy.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The housing index rallied 3.6 percent, outperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc surged 4.16 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) advanced 3.9 percent.
A separate report hinted at some stabilization for the downtrodden manufacturing sector. Data firm Markit said its Purchasing Managers Index bounced back in early January from December's 38-month low as output and new business volumes increase at faster rates.
Weak reports on retail sales, inventories, exports and industrial production have left economists estimating that gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 2 percent pace in the July-September quarter.
A massive stock market sell-off, which has seen a sharp drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 index since Dec. 31, is also adding to gloom over the economy.
In December, the number of unsold homes on the market tumbled 12.3 percent from November to 1.79 million units, the lowest level since January 2013. Supply was down 3.8 percent from a year ago. At December's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, the fewest since January 2005. That was down from 5.1 months in November.
A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. With inventories still tight, the median house price jumped 7.6 percent from a year ago to $224,100. House prices increased 6.7 percent in 2015.
Although higher prices could sideline potential buyers, especially those wanting to purchase a home for the first time, they are boosting equity for homeowners, which could encourage them to put their homes on the market.

Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories. Last month, the share of first-time buyers was 32 percent, up from 30 percent in November and the highest share since August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose to a six-month high last week, suggesting some loss of momentum in the labor market amid a sharp economic slowdown and major stock market selloff.
Another report on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region improved in January as shipments rebounded, but it was still contracting.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Jan. 16, the highest reading since early July, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 278,000 in the latest week. 
While layoffs appear to have picked up a bit in recent weeks, the increases might not suggest a material weakening in labor market conditions as claims data is difficult to adjust around this time of the year.
Claims have now been below the 300,000 mark, which is associated with strong labor market conditions, for 46 straight weeks. That is the longest streak since the early 1970s.
U.S. stock index futures extended gains after the data and remarks by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were flat. The dollar was stronger against a basket of currencies.
ECONOMIC HEADWINDS 
Outside the energy, mining and manufacturing sectors, which have been devastated by a slump in crude oil prices and a robust dollar, layoffs have been generally low as the labor market approaches full employment.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the data and only claims for Puerto Rico and Wyoming had been estimated. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,500 to 285,000 last week, the highest reading since mid-April.
The claims data covered the survey period for January nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims rose 14,250 between the December and January survey periods. 
While that suggests a drop in payroll gains from December's robust 292,000 jobs, employment growth in January is expected to top 200,000.
The economy is struggling with the headwinds of the strong dollar, slowing global demand and relentless spending cuts in the energy sector, which have pressured manufacturing. 
An inventory overhang has also left businesses placing fewer new orders with factories, leading to predictions that fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of less than 1 percent after expanding at a 2 percent pace in the July-September quarter. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 56,000 to 2.21 million in the week ended Jan. 9. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims rose 3,250 to 2.23 million.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its general activity index rose to -3.5 this month from a reading of -10.2 in December. The index has now been negative for five consecutive months. 

The new orders index remained negative, but increased 10 points to -1.4, while the shipments index increased 12 points, its first positive reading in four months. Inventories at factories in the region continued to decline and firms also reported a drop in the backlog of unfilled orders and shorter delivery times.

On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
Shipments increased this month, but new orders and employment declined modestly. The survey’s price indexes suggest continued downward pressure on manufacturing prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December as the cost of gasoline dropped and rents rose moderately, signs of weak inflation that further diminish expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in March.
Other data on Wednesday showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month, adding to weak reports on retail sales, industrial production, exports, inventory and manufacturing surveys that have suggested a significant slowdown in economic growth at the end of 2015. 
Against the backdrop of renewed weakness in oil prices, which touched new lows on Wednesday, economists say the expected reversion to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target is slowing.
""The broad-based nature of the decline in inflation will hardly be encouraging news at the Fed, and if anything it is likely to temper their confidence in the outlook for inflation,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.  
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in November. Despite that drop, the CPI increased 0.7 percent in the 12 months through December, the biggest rise in a year. That followed a 0.5 percent gain in November. 
Economists had forecast the CPI remaining unchanged last month and rising 0.8 percent from a year ago. 
The year-over-year inflation rate is rising as oil price-driven weak readings in 2015 drop out of the calculation. The boost from the so-called base effects could, however, be limited by lower oil prices, which are near 12-year lows.
Consumer prices increased 0.7 percent in 2015, the second smallest December-December gain in the last 50 years, after rising 0.8 percent in 2014. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in December after advancing 0.2 percent in each of the prior three months.
In the 12 months through December, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July 2012, after climbing 2.0 percent in November. The Fed tracks a price measure that is running well below the core CPI.
FALLING FOOD PRICES
U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell, tracking lower oil prices.
Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations assigned a probability of 29 percent to the central bank's raising rates at the March 15-16 meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch program. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first hike in almost a decade.
Last month, gasoline tumbled 3.9 percent after falling 2.4 percent in November. Food prices fell for a second straight month, with meat, poultry, fish and eggs prices posting their biggest decline since August 1979.
The gain in the core CPI was kept in check by moderate increases in rents and medical care costs. Rents rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in November.
""Faltering rent inflation ... signals the loss of economic momentum. That momentum moved millennials off of their parent's couch and onto their own, but momentum may no longer be strong enough to put the same upward pressure on rents,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in new York.
Medical care costs edged up 0.1 percent, slowing from a 0.4 percent rise in November. The costs of doctor visits were unchanged after jumping 1.1 percent the prior month. 
A strong dollar as well as an inventory bloat is dampening prices for some core goods. Apparel prices declined for a fourth straight month, while prices for new motor vehicles dipped 0.1 percent.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.15 million units as groundbreaking on both single- and multi-family projects fell. 
The impact of unseasonably warm weather was likely offset by heavy rains in some parts of the country. Starts rose 10.3 percent last year to their highest level since 2007.
Building permits declined 3.9 percent to a 1.23 million-unit rate in December, pulled down by an 11.4 percent plunge in permits for multi-family buildings. Permits for the construction of single-family homes rose 1.8 percent last month.
Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York, said fundamentals are still giving muscle to the housing market. 

""Slowly strengthening wage growth, solid employment gains, the gradual release of pent-up demand, and still-low mortgage rates all underpin our expectation of a continued strengthening in housing activity over the course of 2016,"" he said.

390,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2016 10:05AM ET</span>",Bank of Canada leaves interest rate unchanged at 0.50%,"Investing.com - The Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate on hold in January, saying that risks to the inflation profile are balanced, it announced on Wednesday.
The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, broadly in line with market expectations. Some market analysts expected the BoC to cut rates by 25 basis points to 0.25% in response to fresh falls in oil prices.
Inflation in Canada is evolving broadly as expected. Total CPI remains near the bottom of the Bank’s target range as the disinflationary effects of economic slack and low consumer energy prices are only partially offset by the inflationary impact of the lower Canadian dollar on the prices of imported goods.
Prices for oil and other commodities have declined further and this represents a setback for the Canadian economy. GDP growth likely stalled in the fourth quarter of 2015, pulled down by temporary softness in the U.S. economy, weaker business investment and several other temporary factors.
The Bank now expects the economy’s return to above-potential growth to be delayed until the second quarter of 2016. The protracted process of reorientation towards non-resource activity is underway, helped by stronger U.S. demand, the lower Canadian dollar, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions.
The BoC judges that the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher, as expected.
Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.
BoC Governor Stephen Poloz was to comment on the decision at a press conference later in the day.
USD/CAD was trading at 1.4506 from around 1.4630 ahead of the announcement.

Despite the drop last month, consumer prices rose 0.7% in the 12 months to December, the biggest increase in a year.
Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, ticked up 0.1%, missing forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and were up 2.1% from a year earlier.

394,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2016 08:33AM ET</span>",U.S. inflation falls 0.1% in December; core prices up 0.1%,"Investing.com - Consumer price inflation in the U.S. unexpectedly declined in December, while prices excluding food and energy costs inched up less than forecast, official data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% from a month earlier in December, compared to expectations for a flat reading.
Year-over-year, consumer prices were 0.7% higher from the same month a year earlier, below expectations for a 0.8% increase and after rising 0.5% in November.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1%, missing forecasts for a gain of 0.2%. Core consumer prices rose 0.2% in November.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.1% last month, in line with expectations and up from 2.0% the prior month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.1% in December, matching forecasts and following a flat reading in the prior month.
Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will now have to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, as inflation is more than a percentage point below the central bank's target of 2.0%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy grew 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching expectations and the slowest since the global financial crisis, putting pressure on Beijing to roll out more support measures as fears of a sharper slowdown panic investors.
Chinese leaders have been struggling to put a floor under cooling activity, even as a renewed plunge in the country's stock markets and the yuan currency have stoked worries that conditions in the world's second-largest economy may be rapidly deteriorating.
After being a major locomotive of global growth in recent years, China is locked in the midst of a protracted slowdown, weighed down by weak exports, factory overcapacity, slowing investment, a soft property market and high debt levels.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted Oct-Dec gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.8 percent, easing from 6.9 percent in the third quarter. It is the weakest pace of expansion since the first quarter of 2009, when growth tumbled to 6.2 percent.
Full-year growth was 6.9 percent, roughly in line with the government's target of around 7 percent but the slowest pace of expansion for China in a quarter of a century. Economists had expected 6.9 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the economy will lose more momentum this year, forecasting growth will cool to 6.5 percent even if Beijing ramps up fiscal spending and cuts interest rates again, as widely expected.
Tuesday's data suggest no material change in what most economists have been telling the world for years: China's economy is cooling gradually from sizzling double-digit growth rates to a hopefully more sustainable pace in the mid-single digits, with no signs yet of a hard landing which investors fear.
But some market watchers believe real growth levels may be much weaker than official data suggest, jeopardizing the fragile global economy.
WEAK END TO 2015
Other data on Tuesday suggested China's economy continued to lose steam late in the year, dashing hopes that a year-long flurry of government measures were finally beginning to take effect.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, economic growth eased to 1.6 percent in the fourth-quarter, versus expectations of 1.7 percent and down from 1.8 percent in the third quarter.
Industrial output rose 5.9 percent in December from a year earlier, missing forecasts of 6.0 percent, and slowing from November's 6.2 percent.
Retail sales climbed 11.1 percent in December from a year earlier, but less than an 11.3 percent rise expected by the market and November's 11.2 percent.
Fixed-asset investment growth, a crucial driver of the economy, grew 10.0 percent in 2015 from the previous year, also missing market expectations.
Economists had expected investment growth would come in at 10.2 percent - the same rate as in the first 11 months of 2015.

Data on Monday showed China's home prices continued to rise in December 2015, adding to signs of improvements in the housing market, which accounts for about 13 percent of GDP. But a huge overhang of unsold homes means the property sector remains uneven across the country and a full-blown recovery is not seen this year.

Industrial output dropped 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.9 percent decline in November, the U.S. Federal
Reserve said on Friday. The Fed had previously reported a 0.6 percent drop for November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production declining 0.2 percent last month.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent.
The industrial sector measured by the U.S. central bank comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
A strong dollar, less inventory investment and cuts by energy firms due to sustained low oil prices have hurt industrial production.
The slump in output primarily reflected cutbacks for utilities and mining, the Fed said. The utilities sector has
suffered due to warmer-than-usual temperatures across much of the country, which has reduced demand for heating.
Manufacturing output slipped 0.1 percent in December and by a downwardly revised 0.1 percent in the prior month.
With overall output declining, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell 0.4 percentage points to 76.5 percent in December, from a downwardly revised 76.9 percent in November.

The Fed views capacity use as a leading indicator in deciding how much further the economy can grow before sparking higher inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell in December as unseasonably warm weather undercut purchases of winter apparel and cheaper gasoline weighed on receipts at service stations, the latest indication that economic growth braked sharply in the fourth quarter.
Other data on Friday showed producer prices fell last month on weak energy costs and modest gains in the price of services, suggesting that inflation could struggle to reach the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target this year.
The Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.4 percent in November. For all of 2015, retail sales rose 2.1 percent, the weakest reading since 2009, after rising 3.9 percent in 2014.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services fell 0.3 percent after advancing 0.5 percent the prior month. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
The retail sales report joined weak data on construction, manufacturing and export growth that have suggested growth cooled significantly in the final three months of 2015.
The economy has been hammered by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have undermined manufacturing and export-oriented industries. Business efforts to cut an inventory overhang and energy sector spending cuts have also been a drag.
In a separate report the Labor Department said its producer price index slipped 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the PPI declined 1.0 percent after falling 1.1 percent in November. December
marked the 11th straight 12-month decrease in the index.
Producer prices fell 1.0 percent in 2015, the weakest since the series started in 2010, after rising 0.9 percent in 2014.
Coming on the heels of a report on Thursday showing a steep drop in import prices in December, weak producer prices suggest that an anticipated rise in inflation will probably fall short of the Fed's 2 percent target.
Inflation, which has been tamed by dollar strength, tepid wage growth and cheaper oil, is expected to rise this year as 2015's weak figures fall out of the calculation. However, persistently low readings could limit the boost from the favorable so-called base effects.
The inflation outlook will likely determine the timing of further interest rate increases after the Fed last month raised its key overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, the first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose on the data, while the dollar fell against the yen. U.S. stock index futures extended losses.
The core retail sales drop last month could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter GDP estimates, which currently range between a 0.5 percent and a 1.4 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.
Auto sales were flat after rising the prior month. Receipts at service stations fell 1.1 percent after decreasing 1.3 percent in November. Sales at clothing stores dropped 0.9 percent. Receipts at electronics and appliance outlets fell further last month.

But there were pockets of strength. Sales at online retailers and sporting goods and hobby stores rose. Receipts at building materials and garden equipment stores increased solidly, likely boosted by warm temperatures. Furniture store sales rose last month.

The Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales slipped 0.1 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales unchanged after a previously reported 0.2 percent rise in November. For all of 2015, retail sales rose 2.1 percent, the weakest reading since 2009, after rising 3.9 percent in 2014.

Core retail sales previously were reported to have advanced 0.6 percent in November. Economists had forecast them rising 0.3 percent last month.
The mixed retail sales report joins weak data on construction, manufacturing and export growth in suggesting that economic activity cooled significantly in the final three months of last year.
It could raise concerns that the manufacturing and export-oriented sector malaise was filtering to other parts of the economy. Manufacturing has been bruised by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand. Business efforts to cut an inventory overhang and energy sector spending cuts have also been a drag.
The core retail sales drop last month and the downward revision to the November figure could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter GDP estimates, which currently range between a 0.5 percent and a 1.4 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but remained below levels associated with a healthy labor market.
Other data on Thursday showed import prices tumbled in December for a sixth straight month as the cost of petroleum and a range of other goods fell further, suggesting a tame inflation environment could persist in the near term. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 284,000 for the week ended Jan. 9, the Labor Department said. Still, it was the 45th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 mark, which is associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest such stretch since the early 1970s. 
Economists had forecast claims slipping to 275,000 last week. The increase likely reflects volatility rather than a change in labor market conditions, as the data is difficult to adjust during holidays. Claims also tend to increase at the start of each quarter.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 278,750 last week.
U.S. stock index futures were trading higher after the data, while the dollar was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
The labor market has largely shrugged off weakness in the economy, with nonfarm payrolls surging in December. Economic growth has been hit by a strong dollar, slowing global demand, efforts by businesses to slim an inventory bloat, and spending cuts by energy companies.
BENIGN INFLATION 
In another report, the Labor Department said import prices decreased 1.2 percent last month after dropping 0.5 percent in November. Import prices have now declined in 16 of the last 18 months, a sign they will continue to weigh on consumer goods prices. For all of 2015, import prices fell 8.2 percent, the largest calendar-year decrease since 2008.
The strong dollar and a sharp drop in oil prices are keeping imported inflation subdued, leaving overall inflation well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. 
With the dollar continuing to rise against major currencies and oil prices hovering at 12-year lows, inflation will probably remain benign for a while. 
Economists say weak inflation together with slowing domestic and global growth could make the Fed cautious about increasing interest rates at its March policy meeting, despite tightening labor market conditions. 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first rate hike in nearly a decade.
In November, imported petroleum prices plunged 10 percent after sliding 3.6 percent in November. Excluding petroleum, import prices slipped 0.4 percent after falling 0.3 percent in November.
The dollar's 21.7 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners over the last 20 months has made imported goods cheaper. Prices for industrial supplies excluding petroleum fell 1.4 percent, while the cost of imported capital goods slipped 0.3 percent. 

The report also showed export prices dropping 1.1 percentlast month after sliding 0.7 percent in November. Export prices fell 6.5 percent in 2015, the largest calendar-year drop since the index was first published in 1983.

The four-week moving average was 278,750, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's 275,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The BOE said it was holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.50%, in a widely expected move. The rate has been held at that level since March 2009. The central bank also said it was to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion.
Minutes from the central bank's policy meeting showed that eight members were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5%, in line with expectations and unchanged from the previous meeting. Dissenting member Ian McCafferty voted for a 0.25% hike in the benchmark rate to 0.75% for the fifth consecutive month.
All nine members were in favor of making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.
According to the minutes, rates are expected to rise gradually but to lower levels than previous cycles. The majority of policymakers said the expected pickup in inflation would be “a little more modest than previously assumed.”
Expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of England have been pushed back to late-2016 due to a recent spate of weaker than expected data and amid uncertainty over a referendum on whether or not Britain should stay in the European Union.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rose in November and employers appeared to have trouble finding qualified workers, a trend that could trigger a pick-up in wage growth this year.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 82,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.43 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Tuesday.
The rise lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent in October. Hiring rose to 5.20 million from 5.17 million the prior month, continuing to lag job openings. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.6 percent.
Job openings are high relative to the unemployment rate, which is currently at a 7-1/2 year low of 5 percent.
""We interpret this as a sign of a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills of job seekers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""Since firms appear unable to fill job openings with unemployed labor resources, we expect there will be competition for already-employed workers, which should lead to stronger wage growth.""
Even as the labor market tightens, wage growth has been frustratingly slow. Average hourly earnings have failed to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Fed officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation. 
The Fed last month raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, in a vote of confidence in the economy. Further hikes will likely depend on the inflation outlook and financial market conditions, economists say.
Tightening labor market conditions were also corroborated by the National Federation of Independent Business survey on Tuesday, which showed the share of small businesses reporting they could not find qualified workers in December was the highest in six years.
According to the NFIB, finding qualified workers now ranks as one of the main challenges for small businesses. The share of businesses reporting wage increases remained relatively high in December. 
""The high proportion of firms with hard-to-fill positions is a sign that the labor market has tightened up to the point that wages are being pulled higher,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) Securities in New York.
But for now, wage growth will likely remain gradual. The JOLTS report showed the quit rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, was unchanged at 2.0 percent in November. The number of unemployed job seekers per open job fell to a ratio of 1.46 from 1.48 in October.
There were big increases in job openings in leisure and hospitality, and construction sectors. Job openings fell in professional and business services, and trade, transportation, and utilities sectors.

""The JOLTS report is consistent with our view that the labor market will continue to improve, but that we will see some moderation in job growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. payrolls surged in December and the job count for the prior two months was revised sharply higher, showing the economy on solid ground despite a troubling international backdrop.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 292,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, as hiring got a boost from unseasonably warm weather. The unemployment rate held steady at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent even as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the job market.
The robust employment data helped soothe fears about the economy's health, and suggested recent weakness would largely be contained to the manufacturing and export-oriented sectors, which have been hit by a strong dollar and anemic global demand. Efforts by businesses to whittle down an inventory glut and spending cuts by energy companies have also inflicted pain.
""It gives us a short-term shot in the arm and pushes back the idea that we are headed for a global recession or that weakness in China will sink our economy,"" says David Donabedian, chief investment officer at Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management in Baltimore.
Slumping oil prices and slowing growth in China have cast a pall on the outlook for the global economy.
The upbeat employment report briefly helped staunch the bleeding on Wall Street, but was offset by further declines in oil prices. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies as traders ramped up bets the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in March. Prices for U.S. government debt rose on safe-haven bids.
Concerns about a slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, have spooked investors worldwide. But signs of stability emerged overnight after China ditched a stock market circuit breaker and guided its currency higher.
U.S. payrolls for October and November were revised to show 50,000 more jobs created than previously reported, adding to the report's upbeat tone. The only wrinkle was a one cent drop in average hourly earnings.
Economists, who slashed fourth-quarter U.S. growth forecasts on recent soft economic data, had expected payrolls to increase by only 200,000 last month. Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates currently range from as low as a 0.4 percent annual rate to as high as a 1.1 percent pace.
Though payroll growth was softer last year than in 2014, with 2.65 million jobs created compared with 3.1 million in the prior year, the job gains in 2015 were still the second largest since 1999.
FOCUS ON WAGE GROWTH
While the labor market's resilience could spur Fed policymakers to hike rates in March, some economists said low inflation and the recent turmoil in financial markets could stay their hand.
""These figures obviously support a March rate hike from the Fed, but ... it is developments in inflation rather than the labor market that will determine the pace of future rate hikes,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Markets in New York. ""With oil prices close to $30 a barrel now, this latest labor market improvement doesn't necessarily guarantee a March rate hike.""
The U.S. central bank last month raised overnight rates by a quarter percentage point to between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade, and a subsequent move at its next meeting this month was already seen as off the table.
With the Fed focused on inflation, wage growth is under scrutiny. Economists said December's decline in earnings could simply be due to a calendar-related quirk.
Despite that drop, the year-on-year gain moved up to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent in November, although that reflected an unusually weak December 2014.
Also being watched closely is the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job. While the rate increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.6 percent in December, it remains near four-decade lows.
There are concerns persistently low participation could hamper job growth as the supply pool of workers shrinks, unless a pick-up in earnings entices more Americans to return to the labor force. The employment-to-population ratio increased to 59.5 percent last month, its highest level since May 2009, from 59.4 percent in November.
Employment gains in December were concentrated in the services sector, with mining shedding a further 8,000 jobs. Employment in the mining sector declined by 129,000 in 2015 and more losses are likely with oil prices at an 11-year low.
Oilfield services provider Schlumberger last month announced another round of job cuts in addition to 20,000 layoffs already reported in 2015. The company said it expected the slowdown in drilling activity to continue this year.
Manufacturing added 8,000 jobs last month and warm weather boosted construction payrolls, which increased by 45,000. Retail payrolls rose only 4,300 as mild temperatures hurt sales of winter apparel.

The weather also limited job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, with employment rising 29,000 after increasing by 47,000 the prior month. Temporary help had a gain of 34,400 jobs last month and government payrolls rose 17,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in December and employment for the prior two months was revised sharply higher, suggesting that a recent manufacturing-led slowdown in economic growth would be temporary.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 292,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate held steady at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent even as more people entered the labour force, a sign of confidence in the job market.
Payrolls for October and November were revised to show 50,000 more jobs created than previously reported, adding to the report's upbeat tone. The only wrinkle was a one cent drop in average hourly earnings, but that was most likely because of calendar effects which should reverse in the January report.
The robust employment data should soothe fears about the economy's health and suggests the recent weakness in activity is mostly limited to the manufacturing and export-oriented sectors, which have been hit by a strong dollar (DXY) and anaemic global demand. Efforts by businesses to whittle down an inventory glut and spending cuts by energy companies have also inflicted pain.
""It is one more sign the domestic economy continues to chug along,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri. ""It is not a game changer in terms of faster economic growth, but it offsets some of the other indicators that recently have suggested the economy might be slowing down.""
In the wake of soft reports on manufacturing, construction spending and export growth, economists this week slashed their fourth-quarter growth estimates by as much a full percentage point to as low as a 0.4 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2 percent rate in the third quarter of last year.
Friday's jobs report offered a respite to global stock markets after heavy selling this week sparked by signs of slowing growth in China. U.S. stock index futures added to gains and the dollar rallied after the data, while prices of U.S. Treasuries pared losses. U.S. short-term interest rate futures fell.
Economists had expected payrolls to increase only 200,000 last month and the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 5 percent. The U.S. economy added 2.65 million jobs in 2015, compared to 3.1 million in 2014.

While labour market resilience would favour another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in March, economists say recent financial market turmoil and concerns among policymakers over low inflation suggest the U.S. central bank may stay on the sidelines a bit longer.
The Fed last month raised overnight interest rates by a quarter percentage point to between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade, and a subsequent move at its next meeting this month was already seen as off the table.
Wage growth will come under scrutiny this year. Despite the drop in average hourly earnings in December, the year-on-year gain in earnings was 2.5 percent in December compared to 2.3 percent in November. That was mostly because wages were unusually weak in December 2014.
Wage growth is expected to accelerate by the middle of the year as the labour market settles into full employment.
Also being watched closely this year is the labour force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job. While the rate increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.6 percent in December, it remains near four-decade lows.
There are concerns that persistently low participation could hamper job growth as the supply pool of workers shrinks, unless a pick-up in earnings entices more Americans to return to the labour force.
The employment-to-population ratio increased to 59.5 percent, the highest since May 2009, from 59.4 percent in November.
Employment gains in December were concentrated in the services sector, with mining shedding 8,000 jobs. Employment in the mining sector declined by 129,000 in 2015 and more losses are likely after the price of oil (CLc1) this week tumbled to an 11-year low.
Oilfield services provider Schlumberger (N:SLB) last month announced another round of job cuts in addition to 20,000 layoffs already reported in 2015. The company said it expected the slowdown in drilling activity to continue this year.
Manufacturing added 8,000 jobs last month. Unusually warm weather boosted construction payrolls, which increased by 45,000. There were also gains in the leisure and hospitality sector.

Retail payrolls rose only 4,300 as mild temperatures hurt sales of winter apparel. Temporary help increased 34,400 last month and government payrolls rose 17,000. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2016 09:09AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims fall; planned layoffs smallest in 15-1/2 years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell last week and layoffs in December were the smallest in 15-1/2 years, pointing to a firmer labor market even as economic growth appears to have slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.
Coming on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing private payrolls in December notched their biggest increase in a year, the data on Thursday suggest the economy's fundamentals remain healthy as it struggles against the headwinds of a strong dollar, bloated inventories and energy sector investment cuts. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended Jan. 2, the Labor Department said. The decline partially unwound the prior week's jump, which had lifted claims to their highest level since early July. 
Claims were volatile in December, reflecting the challenges of adjusting the data around holidays. Last week was the 44th straight week that claims held below the 300,000 mark, which is associated with a healthy labor market.
That is the longest run since the early 1970s.
""Unemployment claims tend to exhibit heightened volatility throughout the holiday season, even after seasonal adjustment; however, the current data continue to indicate that U.S. labor markets are fundamentally healthy,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 1,250 to 275,750 last week.
In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to cut 23,622 jobs in December, the fewest since June 2000. That was down 24 percent from November and the lowest December job-cut total on record.
The good news on the labor market comes ahead of the release on Friday of the government's closely watched employment report for December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 200,000 in December, on top of the 211,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent.
""The apparent improvement in job security around the end of the year is good news for the nation's workers,"" said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending January 1 decreased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 from the previous week’s total of 287,000, which was the highest since mid-July. Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 12,000 to 275,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 43 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended December 25 rose to 2.230 million from 2.205 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to fall to 2.193 million.
The four-week moving average was 275,750, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week's 270,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2016 09:31AM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls rise; trade deficit narrows ,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private companies added workers at a brisk clip in December, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite signs that growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.
Other data on Wednesday showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in November likely as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang pushed imports of goods to their lowest level in nearly five years, outpacing a drop in exports.
Payrolls processor ADP said private-sector employment rose by 257,000 last month, the largest gain since December 2014, after increasing by 211,000 in November. However, the ADP data tends to overstate job gains in December because of a year-end accounting quirk.
""The labor markets are finishing the year with a bang, that's for sure. December was also extraordinarily warm as well, which means the number may exaggerate the labor market strength,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The ADP report, which was jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive December employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased 200,000 last month, on top of the 211,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent.
Labor market strength suggests the economy's fundamentals remain healthy, and some economists say that could keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in March.
The U.S. central bank last month raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first rate increase in nearly a decade.
U.S. stock index futures were trading sharply lower on Wednesday, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
TRADE DEFICIT SHRINKS
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit fell 5.0 percent to $42.4 billion in November.
Despite the shrinking trade gap, declining exports are the latest indication that economic growth braked sharply in the fourth quarter. While inventories likely accounted for much of the drop in imports, the weakness could also be pointing to a slowdown in domestic demand, which was flagged by weak December automobile sales.
Trade, which subtracted 0.26 percentage point from gross domestic product in the third quarter, is likely to have remained a drag on growth in the fourth quarter.
A strong dollar and the inventory bloat, which has left businesses with little appetite to order more merchandise, have combined with spending cuts in the energy sector to take some steam out of the economy in recent months.
Economists this week slashed their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as one percentage point to as low as a 0.5 percent annual pace, which also accounted for the impact of unseasonably warm weather on sales of winter apparel and other merchandise.
The economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Businesses accumulated a record pile of inventory in the first half of 2015, which was unmatched by demand, leaving warehouses bulging with unsold goods.
Imports of goods dropped 2.0 percent to $183.5 billion in November, the lowest level since February 2011. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the weakest since May 2009. There were also declines in imports of capital and consumer goods.
Lower oil prices as well as increased domestic energy production also helped to curb the import bill. The price of petroleum averaged $39.24 per barrel in November. That was the lowest level since February 2009 and down from $40.12 in October and $82.92 in November 2014.
The dollar gained almost 10 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners last year, eroding the appeal of U.S.-made goods overseas.
Goods exports slipped 1.1 percent to $122.2 billion in November, the lowest level since June 2011.
Exports of industrial supplies and materials hit their lowest level in five years, while petroleum exports were the weakest since December 2010. Exports of non-petroleum products dropped to their lowest level since June 2011.
The decline in exports to the United States' main trading partners was nearly broad-based in November. But the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.2 percent to $31.3 billion in November.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted further in December, as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar undermined export profitability, while U.S. construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November, suggesting only moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 48.2 from 48.6 in November and is now at its lowest level since June 2009.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The reading was just below expectations of 49 from a Reuters poll of 80 economists.
The employment index fell to 48.1 from 51.3 a month earlier. Expectations called for a reading of 50. 
An alternative reading from private data vendor Markit showed continued expansion in manufacturing but at a slower pace.
Markit's purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.2 from 52.8 in November, the lowest since October 2012.
The new orders subcomponent fell to 50.2 from 53.1, the lowest since Sept 2009.
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING FALLS
U.S. construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November as a drop in nonresidential investment offset an increase in housing activity.
Construction spending slipped 0.4 percent, the first and also biggest drop since June 2014, after a downwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in October, the Commerce Department said on Monday.
The government revised construction data from January 2005 through October 2015 because of a ""processing error in the tabulation of data."" The revisions, which showed construction spending was not as strong as previously reported for much of 2015, could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates.
Growth estimates are currently hovering below a 2.0 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 2.0 percent rate in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6 percent in November after a previously reported 1.0 percent increase in October.
Construction outlays were up 10.5 percent compared to November of last year. Construction spending in November was held down by a 0.8 percent drop in nonresidential construction. Outlays on residential construction rose 0.2 percent.
Private construction spending slipped 0.2 percent, but spending on private residential construction rose 0.3 percent.
Public construction outlays declined 1.0 percent. Spending on state and local government construction projects, which is the largest portion of the public sector segment, slipped 0.4 percent. Federal government outlays tumbled 7.2 percent.

BENGALURU/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The global economy finished last year on a fragile footing, with factory activity in China shrinking for the 10th month running in December while a pick-up in the euro zone was tepid, suggesting more policy stimulus may be in the pipeline.
Coming on a day of turmoil in Asian stock markets after China's central bank fixed the yuan at a 4-1/2 year low, the data point to a further dose of the sluggish growth and inflation, weak demand and jittery financial markets that characterized 2015.
Mainland Chinese shares sank over 7 percent on the lower yuan fixing and shrinking factory activity.
European stock markets fell too, though the declines were less sharp as investors took note of the brighter data from the euro zone.
Manufacturing activity in the single currency area improved last month in all the countries covered by a business survey, suggesting factories performed better over last year as a whole compared to the previous three.
Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a 20-month high of 53.2, just above a flash reading of 53.1 and of 52.8 in November. The PMIs suggest a pickup in activity, but in most countries still a mild pace of growth.
This year ""is going to be a rerun of 2015 with added risks,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""The global economic story is based on weak fundamentals with China slowing further and policy uncertainties existing in developed economies.""
While the PMIs point to improving activity in the euro zone, the European Central Bank would have to beef up its policy arsenal to get inflation back up to its target, he added.
EURO STIMULUS
The ECB has already cut its deposit rate well below zero and is buying 60 billion euros a month of mostly government bonds to try and boost inflation. Price pressures are still subdued in the region, but a December Reuters poll suggests market expectations of bigger asset purchase program also remain low.
The euro zone output index - which feeds into the composite PMI due on Wednesday and is seen as a good guide to growth - rose to a 20-month high of 54.5, above 54.0 in November.
But firms cut prices for the fourth straight month, leaving the ECB's inflation target of just below 2 percent a distant prospect.
Data on Tuesday is expected to show euro zone inflation rose to 0.3 percent in December from 0.2 percent in November.
A regional bright spot was Italy, where manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace in almost five years, auguring well for growth in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
British factory growth slipped however as new orders came in at the slowest pace in five months.
A similar survey due later on Monday will probably show the downturn in U.S. factories continued in December, despite evidence of a very strong services economy and an interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve a few weeks ago.
The Institute of Supply Managers' manufacturing PMI is forecast to rise to 49.0 from 48.6.
CHINA SLUMP
The Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 48.2, below a Reuters poll consensus of 49.0 and down from 48.6 in November.
That was the lowest since September and well below the 50-point level that separates contraction from expansion. It followed a fractional increase in the official PMI to 49.7.
PMIs in South Korea and Taiwan edged above the 50 mark, though more thanks to a pick-up in domestic demand than any revival in exports.
Weighed down by weak demand at home and abroad, factory overcapacity and cooling investment, China will likely post its weakest economic growth in 25 years in 2015, with the rate of expansion slipping to around 7 percent from 7.3 percent in 2014.
Growth is forecast to slow to 6.5 percent this year and next, according to the latest Reuters poll.
The drag from industry comes as China makes gradual progress in its transformation to a more service-driven economy. An official survey on the services sector showed activity quickened in December, with its main index rising to 54.4, from 53.6 in November.

China has room to ease reserve requirements for banks and loosen government purse strings. It has also been steadily nudging its currency lower.

Japan's economy dodged recession in the third quarter with the initial estimate of a contraction revised to an annualized expansion of 1.0 percent due to gains in capital expenditure, data showed last month.

An unexpected rise in machinery orders also suggests that business investment could help underpin growth due to improving corporate activity and domestic demand.

While China's services sector ended 2015 on a strong note, the economy still looked set to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century despite a raft of policy easing steps, including repeated interest rate cuts, in the past year or so.
The world's second-largest economy faces persistent risks this year as leaders have pledged to push so-called ""supply-side reform"" to reduce excess factory capacity and high debt levels.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.7 in December, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters and up only fractionally from November. A reading below 50 suggests a contraction in activity, while a higher one indicates an expansion.
Still, economists seemed to find some comfort that there were no signs of a sharper deterioration which has been feared by global investors.
The slight pick up in the manufacturing PMI ""suggests that (economic) growth momentum is stabilising somewhat ... however, the sector is still facing strong headwinds, said Zhou Hao, China economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
""In order to facilitate the destocking and deleveraging process, monetary policy will remain accommodative and the fiscal policy will be more proactive.""
Weak demand from at home and abroad has weighed on China's factories, exacerbating the problem of excess capacity and forcing them to cut prices of their goods, eating into their profits and adding to deflationary pressures in the economy.
Total new orders - a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand - rose to 50.2 in December from November's 49.8, the PMI survey showed.
But export orders shrank for the 15th straight month, albeit at a less severe pace. The sub-index inched up to 47.5 from November's 46.4.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that although oil prices were very low at present, cash at the end of the year was tight for factories, putting relatively large pressure on manufacturers.
A CHALLENGING 2016
China's economic growth is expected to cool from 7.3 percent in 2014 to 6.9 percent in 2015, the central bank said in a recent work paper, its slowest pace in 25 years. It said growth could ease further to 6.8 percent in 2016.
Some China watchers, however, believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest.
Leaders at the annual Central Economic Work Conference last month pledged to make monetary policy more flexible and expand the budget deficit in 2016 to help underpin growth and reforms.
Indeed, China could run its biggest budget deficit in half a century this year as leaders turn to more government spending to arrest the slowdown in the economy, policy advisers say, after disappointing returns from a year of policy easing.
The PBOC has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 and reduced banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR), or the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves.
The government has also stepped up spending on infrastructure projects and eased restrictions on home buying to boost the sluggish property market.
The central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratios further this year.
A similar official survey on the services sector showed activity there quickened in December, again helping to ease fears of a hard landing for the economy this year.
The services sector has been the lone bright spot in the economy in the last few years, helping to offset prolonged weakness in the vast manufacturing sector, though financial markets tend to focus more closely on factory readings.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 54.4, from November's 53.6, according to the NBS.
The services sector has accounted for the bigger part of China's economic output for at least two years.
A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing Caixin/Markit PMI, which focuses more on small-to-medium-sized private firms, will be released on Jan.4.

China is set to release fourth quarter and full-year GDP data on Jan. 19.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 for the week ended Dec.26, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

That was the highest level since July, although in recent months the weekly readings for claims have held near a 42-year low.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending December 25 increased by 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 from the previous week’s total of 267,000.

The four-week moving average was 277,000, an increase of 4,500 from the previous week\'s 270,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Wednesday its pending home sales index slipped 0.9 percent to 106.9. The NAR said the index rose slightly more in October than initially estimated. 
Economists had expected a 0.5 percent increase in November.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and the declines in recent months could point slower growth in homebuying in 2016, when interest rates are expected to rise. Mortgage rates have only inched higher since the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate by a quarter point on Dec. 16, but Fed policymakers expect to continue hiking next year. 
Pending home sales had been posting strong gains earlier in the year and were still up 2.7 percent from a year ago. 

But contracts fell 3 percent in the Northeast in November from a month earlier and were down 5.5 percent in the West. They rose 1.3 percent in the South and gained 1.0 percent in the Midwest.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index inched down by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 0.5%. Pending home sales in October rose by 0.4%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported gain of 0.2%.
Pending home sales in November slightly declined for the third time in four months as buyers continue to battle both rising home prices and limited homes available for sale.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 5.1% in November, above forecasts for an increase of 4.0% and following a gain of 2.3% in the prior month.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says November's dip in contract activity continues the modestly slowing trend seen ever since pending sales peaked to an over nine year high back in May

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, nearing a 42-year low as labor market conditions continued to tighten in a boost to the economy. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended Dec.19, not far from levels last seen in late 1973, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 270,000 in the latest week. Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a buoyant labor market, for 42 consecutive weeks. That is the longest stretch since the early 1970s. 
However, some of the decline last week could be attributed to difficulties adjusting the figures during the holidays.
Still, labor market strength is helping to underpin consumer spending, supporting the economy as it deals with the headwinds of a strong dollar, slowing global growth, spending cuts by energy firms and an inventory overhang.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,750 to 272,500 last week.
Prices of longer-dated U.S. government debt rose after the data, while the dollar pared some losses. U.S. stock index futures were slightly higher.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the data and that no states had been estimated. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 47,000to 2.20 million in the week ended Dec. 12. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 10,000 to 2.21 million. 
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for December's unemployment rate. Continuing claims rose 42,250 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting little change in the jobless rate, which was at a 7-1/2-year low of 5.0 percent last month.
The unemployment rate is in a range many Federal Reserve officials see as consistent with full employment. It has dropped seven-tenths of a percentage point this year.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2015 01:13PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing struggles; rising income brightens outlook,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods fell in November and the prior month's increase was revised sharply lower as the drag on manufacturing from a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector showed little sign of abating. 
But the outlook for the economy remains encouraging, with other data on Wednesday showing consumer sentiment at a five-month high in December and personal income rising for an eighth straight month in November. That should support consumer spending and generate enough economic growth for the Federal Reserve to steadily raise interest rates next year.
""The economy is not too cold, and not too hot, it is just right. The Fed can stay the course ... no need to depart from a gradual pace given what we know currently about the economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.4 percent last month. October's increase in orders for these so-called core capital goods was revised down to 0.6 percent from 1.3 percent.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy,is also buckling under businesses' efforts to reduce an inventory bloat and sluggish global demand, which has curtailed new orders growth. The dollar has gained almost 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners over the last 18 months. 
At the same time, plunging crude oil prices, which on Monday plumbed their lowest levels since 2004, have put pressure on oilfield services firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), forcing them to slash capital spending budgets. 
A survey early this month showed manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years. 
Core capital goods shipments fell 0.5 percent last month after declining 1.0 percent in October. Shipments of these goods are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
""Unless we see a big rebound in December or upward revisions, it appears that investment in equipment contracted in the fourth quarter,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
A separate report showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased to 92.6 this month, the highest reading since July, from 91.3 in November. Low inflation, characterized by deep discounts at shopping malls, accounted for the rise in sentiment this month.
The report also showed that consumers' attitudes towards purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles and other big-ticket items hit their highest level since 2005.
WAGES RISING
Prospects for consumer spending next year also got a boost from another report from the Commerce Department showing income increased 0.3 percent last month after gaining 0.4 percent in October. Wages and salaries advanced 0.5 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent gain in October.
U.S. stocks rose on the mixed data, with sentiment also buoyed by a rebound in oil prices. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasuries fell.
A tightening labor market, marked by an unemployment rate that is in a range some Fed officials consider consistent with full employment, is starting to lift wages. 
While that could generate price pressures, inflation will likely remain below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target because of the oil price rout.
""The Fed understands that the competing factors will be with us for a while and that is why it is easy for the members to say that rates will be increased gradually,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate last week by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first increase since mid-2006.
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.4 percent in the 12 months through November, the largest increase since December, after increasing 0.2 percent in October. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November, for the 11th straight month. It is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis inadvertently released part of the consumption portion of its report late on Tuesday.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday sales increased 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000 units. October's sales pace was revised down to 470,000 units from the previously reported 495,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.3 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 505,000 units last month. Sales were up 9.1 percent compared to November of last year.
Despite the signs of some loss of momentum, last month's increase in new home sales should help allay concerns of an abrupt slowdown in activity after a report on Tuesday showed a surprising plunge in homes resales.
Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 10.5 percent in November, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Realtors and economists blamed the large drop on new regulations that were delaying contract closings.
New home sales are counted when contracts are signed, meaning they likely were unaffected by the new mortgage disclosure rules, which have lengthened the closing time for home purchase contracts.
A rebound in sales of existing home sales is expected in December as the housing market remains supported by a tightening jobs market, which is gradually lifting wages.
New home sales tumbled 28.6 percent in the Northeast, but retained the bulk of October's 84.2 percent surge. Sales rose 4.5 percent in the populous South and jumped 20.5 percent in the Midwest. They fell 8.6 percent in the West.
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 2.2 percent to 232,000 last month, the highest since January 2010.
While builders have ramped up construction, in part encouraged by high prices, the supply of new homes remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom.
At November's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.8 months in October. The median price of a new home increased 0.8 percent from a year ago to $305,000.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2015 08:52AM ET</span>",U.S. personal income rises in boost to consumer spending,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. personal income in November rose for an eighth straight month on solid wage gains, which should support consumer spending and bolster economic growth next year.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday income increased 0.3 percent last month after an unrevised 0.4 percent rise in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast income advancing 0.2 percent last month.
Wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent gain in October. A tightening labor market, marked by an unemployment rate that is in a range some Federal Reserve officials consider consistent with full employment, is starting to lift wages.
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis inadvertently released part of the consumption portion of its report late on Tuesday. It showed consumer spending increased 0.3 percent last month after being unchanged in October. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent when adjusted for inflation after holding steady in October.
While consumer spending is likely running below the third-quarter's annualized brisk pace of 3.0 percent, November's increase could prompt economists to modestly lift their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates.
GDP growth estimates for the final three months of the year have been hovering around a 2 percent rate, the same pace of growth in the third quarter.
With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $747.6 billion. Still, they remain at lofty levels. 
Inflation continued to run below the Fed's 2 percent medium-term target last month. A price index for consumer spending was unchanged after nudging up 0.1 percent in October. 
In the 12 months through November, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was up 0.4 percent after rising 0.2 percent in October. 

Excluding food and energy, prices nudged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in October. The so-called core PCE price index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November, for the 11th straight month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a fairly healthy clip in the third quarter as strong consumer and business spending offset efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut, underscoring its resilience despite a raft of headwinds.
Gross domestic product grew at a 2.0 percent annual pace, instead of the 2.1 percent rate reported last month, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate on Tuesday.
While that was a sharp deceleration from the brisk 3.9 percent pace logged in the April-June period, growth remained around the economy's long-run potential.
The Federal Reserve last week raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade.
The rate hike was a vote of confidence in the economy, which has been buffeted by slower global demand, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
""This is not an economy that is just muddling along. The GDP data today back up the Fed's decision to liftoff this month and paves the way for more rate hikes early in 2016,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
While other data on Tuesday showed a surprise 10.5 percent plunge in home resales last month, economists cautioned against reading too much into the drop, noting that new mortgage disclosure rules had caused delays in closing contracts.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales tumbled to an annual rate of 4.76 million units, the lowest level since April 2014. The drop is in stark contrast to robust housing starts, new home sales and bullish homebuilder sentiment.
""Demand didn't change, the processing rules did,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Look for a big-time rebound in December, as housing market fundamentals remain constructive, including falling joblessness, still-low mortgage rates, easing loan standards and plenty of pent-up demand from millennials.""U.S. stocks were trading higher, also bolstered by crude oil prices, which eased off multi-year lows. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell and the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.7 percent pace, not the 3.1 percent rate reported last month, to account for a modest downward revision to corporate profits.
INVENTORIES STILL HIGH
Businesses accumulated $85.5 billion worth of inventory in the third quarter, instead of the $90.2 billion reported in November. That meant the change in inventories sliced off 0.71 percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth, instead of the 0.59 percentage point the government estimated last month.
A record increase in inventories in the first half of the years left warehouses bulging with unsold merchandise and businesses with little appetite to restock.
Despite efforts to whittle down the stockpiles of unsold goods, inventories remain relatively high and will probably weigh on growth in the fourth quarter. Estimates for fourth-quarter growth are currently around a 2 percent rate.
""The pace of stockbuilding is still quite rapid and implies a continued drag on output going forward as firms clear their shelves,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York. ""There is some evidence that this process is well under way in the fourth quarter, though it could conceivably restrain activity on into the first quarter.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.0 percent rate in the third quarter as previously estimated. Spending is being supported by a strengthening labor market and rising home values. Savings, which are near three-year highs, and low inflation are also helping to underpin consumption.
Growth in business spending on equipment was raised to a 9.9 percent rate from a 9.5 percent pace. There were upward revisions to investment in residential construction and government spending.
The drag from trade was slightly larger than previously reported. A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government spending, was revised up one-tenth of a percentage point to a 3.2 percent pace.

There was a modest downward revision to investment in nonresidential structures, to account for ongoing spending cuts by energy firms following a collapse in oil prices.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales tumbled 10.5% to a seasonally adjusted 4.76 million units last month from 5.32 million in October. Analysts had expected existing home sales to rise to 5.35 million units in November.
All four major regions saw sales declines in November.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says multiple factors led to November's sales decline, but the primary reason could be an anomaly as the industry adjusts to the new Know Before You Owe rule.
""Sparse inventory and affordability issues continue to impede a large pool of buyers' ability to buy, which is holding back sales,"" he said.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2015 11:41AM ET</span>","U.S. labor market strengthening, factories struggling","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell from a five-month high, suggesting sustained labor market healing that could lead to further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes next year.
The sign of underlying economic strength came a day after the U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade.
""The labor market continues to stay tight with demand for workers strong and pockets of actual shortages in many industries. The Fed has achieved the employment part of its dual mandate and this is what triggered the rates liftoff yesterday,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Dec.12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
It was the 41st straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest such run since the early 1970s.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered abetter measure of labor market trends as it strips outweek-to-week volatility, slipped 250 to 270,500 last week.
The Fed said in its policy statement on Wednesday that there had been ""further improvement"" in the labor market and that ""underutilization of labor resources"" had diminished appreciably since the beginning of the year.
Despite the labor market momentum, there remains no respite for the manufacturing sector, which has been slammed by a robust dollar, deep spending cuts by energy firms, weak global demand and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.
A separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its gauge of manufacturing activity in the region fell to -5.9 this month from 1.9 in November. It was the third negative reading in the past four months.
Factories in the mid-Atlantic region reported that new orders continued to decline this month, though there was an increase in shipments. Order books shrunk, while inventories increased for the first time in four months.
""The intense headwinds facing the U.S. manufacturing sector continue to linger,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
A survey early this month showed manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, contracted in November for the first time in three years. The weak Philadelphia Fed survey brought it in line with other regional surveys that have been mired in contractionary territory.  
U.S. stocks fell, while the dollar jumped to a fresh two-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. government debt prices rose.
JOBS MARKET STRENGTH
The claims data covered the survey period for December nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims dipped 500 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting another strong month of job gains. Payrolls increased by 211,000 in November. 
""We expect a 200,000 December nonfarm payroll increase, with limited upside risk from a tight claims path,"" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.
Dollar strength, which has eroded exports and the profits of multinational corporations, helped to push the current account deficit in the third quarter to its highest level in nearly seven years, another report from the Commerce Department showed.
The current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 11.7 percent to $124.1 billion, the largest shortfall since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The current account was also pressured by an increase in remittances, government grants and pensions, and dividend payments to foreign individuals and entities. 
The deficit represented 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest share since the second quarter of 2012, up from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. The current account shortfall, however, is not a problem as the United States continues to attract ample income from overseas.

""With rates of return in foreign economies likely to remain depressed for the foreseeable future, we look for the dollar to strengthen further in the coming quarters,"" said Jay Bryson, global economist at  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts in November rebounded from a seven-month low and permits surged to a five-month high, signs of strength in the housing market as the Federal Reserve starts hiking interest rates after years of easy monetary policy.
Other data on Wednesday showed the industrial sector continuing to struggle under the weight of a strong dollar, cutbacks in inventory investment as well as spending cuts by energy firms in response to persistently low oil prices.
Groundbreaking jumped 10.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. Building permits vaulted 11 percent to a 1.29 million-unit rate, the highest since June.
With permits running ahead of starts, home building is likely to remain supported in the months ahead.
The Fed on Wednesday raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points from near zero, the first rate hike in nearly a decade. The U.S. central bank gave an upbeat assessment of the economy and noted that ""the housing sector has improved further.""
With the Fed making it clear that the tightening cycle is likely to be gradual, the increase in borrowing costs is not expected to derail the housing recovery.
""The interest rate is still low compared to historical standards,"" said Kevin Young, an analyst at IBISWorld in Los Angeles.
In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.6 percent in November as unusually warm weather caused a sharp drop in demand for utilities.
The third straight monthly decline in industrial output also reflected another sharp fall in mining production, driven by a plunge in oil and gas well drilling. Manufacturing output was unchanged. However, motor vehicle production fell for the first time since August, a worrying signal for manufacturing.
""We expect the auto sector to remain a drag on total production in coming months. On balance, manufacturing activity is likely to remain weak as the U.S. economy is still adjusting to the shocks of lower energy prices and weaker foreign demand,"" said Laura Rosner, an economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York. U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P homebuilding index rallying 1.98 percent. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, rose more than 2 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, advanced 1.62 percent. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies (DXY), while prices for U.S. Treasury debt (US10YT=RR) fell.
STRONG HOUSING FUNDAMENTALS
November marked the eighth straight month that housing starts remained above a 1-million unit annual pace, the longest stretch since 2007. Economists expect starts to average around 1.1 million units for 2015, which would be the highest since 2007 and up from 1.0 million in 2014.
Robust household formation as labor market strength encourages young adults to leave their childhood homes is underpinning the housing market recovery.
But the sector remains constrained by a persistent shortage of houses for sale. This has resulted in home prices rising faster than salaries, pushing more people towards renting.
""Tight inventories and high prices will provide the incentives for builders to continue ramping up activity,"" said Greg Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.
Single-family housing starts, the largest segment of the market, increased 7.6 percent to a 768,000-unit pace. That was the highest reading since January 2008. Activity was probably also boosted by mild weather. Groundbreaking on single-family projects rose in the South, Northeast and West, but fell in the Midwest.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment surged 16.4 percent to a 405,000-unit pace. That segment has been the driver of residential construction but a shift towards single-family homes is expected in 2016.
""Homebuilders are making progress addressing the shortage of newer vintage single-family homes we see in many markets, especially affordable housing products with a price of under $200,000,"" said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Permits to build single-family homes increased 1.1 percent last month to the highest since December 2007. Multi-family building permits soared 26.9 percent.

Markit said that its seasonally adjusted Flash France Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors declined from 51.0 in November to 50.3 in December, the weakest in four months and missing forecasts for 50.9.
The preliminary services purchasing managers’ index fell to a seasonally adjusted 50.0 this month, an 11-month low. The reading came in below expectations for 50.8 and down from 51.0 in November.
Service providers indicated the slowest rise in new work since August, with some panelists citing an adverse impact following the recent terrorist attacks.
In contrast, the French manufacturing purchasing managers’ index inched up to a seasonally adjusted 51.6 this month, a 21-month high, beating expectations for 50.5 and up from 50.6 a month earlier.
Manufacturers noted the fastest increase in new orders for 21 months. New export orders received by manufacturers rose fractionally, following a decrease in the previous survey period.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Commenting on the report, Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit said, ""PMI data for the fourth quarter as a whole suggest that GDP growth is likely to have remained at a similar moderate pace to the 0.3% rise seen in the previous quarter.""
EUR/USD fell to 1.0932 from around 1.0940 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7268 from 0.7272 earlier.
The Investing.com euro index, which tracks the single currency against a basket of six major rivals, dipped to 87.92, compared to 87.97 ahead of the report.

Guy Debelle said Wednesday.
The data show two-thirds of borrowing is covered by a repayment buffer of at least one month's required mortgage payment, Debelle said in a speech to the 28th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference at Sydney. For half of this borrowing the buffer is more than a year.
""As the time series on this loan feature accumulates it has the potential to be useful information for monetary policy as well as financial-stability considerations,"" he said.
""It will also allow an assessment of the correlations between the various drivers of risk that may lead to credit deterioration.

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index improved to -4.6 this month from a reading of -10.7 in November. Analysts had expected the index to rise to -6.0 in December.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
New orders continued to drop, but shipments increased for the first time since the summer.
Price indexes suggested that input prices increased slightly, while selling prices remained slightly lower.
Labor market conditions deteriorated noticeably, with survey indicators pointing to a sharp decline in both employment levels and hours worked.
Nonetheless, indexes for the six-month outlook increased markedly, suggesting more widespread optimism about future business conditions.
The Empire State index is of interest to traders primarily because it is seen as an early forecast of the national Institute for Supply management factory survey.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices were unchanged from a month earlier, meeting expectations and following a gain of 0.2% in October.
Year-over-year, consumer prices were 0.5% higher from the same month a year earlier, compared to expectations for a 0.4% increase and after rising 0.2% in October.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, meeting expectations. Core consumer prices rose 0.2% in October.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.0% last month, in line with expectations and up from 1.9% the prior month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, in line with expectations and up from -0.1% in October.
The main upward push on inflation came from price movements for transport costs, and alcohol and tobacco.These upward pressures were partially offset by price falls for clothing and footwear, influenced by an increase in the number of items on sale.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation was flat in November, compared to forecasts for a 0.1% decline and following a gain of 0.1% in the prior month.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will now have to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, as inflation is more than a percentage point below the central bank's target of 2.0%.
Bank of England officials have said recently they expect inflation to hover around zero for much of this year, before accelerating back to target during 2016 and 2017.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.2% last month, matching forecasts and up from 1.1% in October.
The retail price index increased 1.1% in November, beating expectations for 0.9% and up from 0.7% a month earlier.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 7.0% in October, above forecasts for a gain of 6.4% and following a 6.1% increase in September.
GBP/USD fell to 1.5149 from around 1.5163 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7271 from 0.7265 earlier.

The Riksbank said it was holding the benchmark repo rate at -0.35%, as widely expected. In addition, the bank left its bond buying target at SEK200 billion by the end of June 2016.

International Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the global economy with the observation that growth in Australia's major trading partners had picked up in the September quarter, driven by an increase in growth in some Asian economies following weakness in the previous quarter. Overall, however, conditions across the Asian region, including in China and Japan, had been weaker than expected this year. Growth in the United States and the recovery in the euro area had continued. Core inflation had generally edged higher in both the advanced and emerging economies, but remained below most central banks' targets. Globally, monetary conditions remained very accommodative.Commodity prices, notably those for iron ore and base metals, had declined further over the previous month, consistent with ongoing indications that growth in global industrial production and trade volumes had remained subdued. There had also been a significant decline in oil prices following a further increase in oil production. Weak investment growth across the major economic regions may have partly explained the relatively subdued growth in world merchandise exports over the previous few years or so.Conditions in the manufacturing and construction sectors in China had remained subdued and the output of many industrial products remained below levels recorded in 2014. There was overcapacity in some parts of the Chinese economy and conditions were likely to become more difficult over time for a range of unprofitable firms in these sectors. Export and import volumes were lower than they had been in 2014, although iron ore imports from Australia appeared to have been steady over 2015. Residential property prices overall had increased a little in recent months, but the stock of unsold housing was substantial in many cities and real estate investment had remained weak. This implied that it could be some time before there was a pick-up in construction activity. In contrast, the rate of retail sales growth had been maintained over 2015. Nonetheless, consumer price inflation had remained low and producer prices had fallen at a faster rate recently, which was consistent with spare productive capacity in the industrial sector and lower commodity prices. In recent months, the Chinese authorities had eased monetary policy further and growth in government expenditure had increased. These policy actions were expected to provide further support for economic activity.GDP in Japan had contracted for two consecutive quarters. Despite that, labour market conditions had remained tight and nominal wage growth had picked up over the past year. Core inflation had continued to edge higher, but remained below the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target. In the rest of east Asia, GDP growth picked up in the September quarter after a soft June quarter outcome. Members noted that this stronger growth could reflect temporary factors and that weak external demand was likely to have negative effects on many economies in the region for some time. India was acknowledged to be a notable exception; domestic demand had continued to grow strongly and inflation had been contained at around 5 per cent, which was a little below the Reserve Bank of India's target.Recent data confirmed that GDP in the United States had grown at a slightly slower pace in the September quarter, following strong growth in the previous quarter, although domestic demand had continued to grow at an above-average rate. There had been a further improvement in labour market conditions, including some signs that wage growth had picked up a little more recently, while unit labour costs (namely, wages adjusted for productivity) had grown at a rate over the past year that was close to their long-run average. Members noted, however, that core inflation had remained stable at a rate below the Federal Reserve's target.The recovery in the euro area economy had continued, aided by further growth in consumption. The unemployment rate had declined further, although there was still significant spare capacity in much of the region. Core inflation was a little higher than it had been earlier in the year, but still well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. GDP growth looked to have picked up in the quarter, but was likely to have remained below average over the year. Resource exports and dwelling investment were expected to have made positive contributions to growth in the September quarter, following declines in the June quarter. Based on partial indicators, household consumption growth was likely to have increased in the September quarter but business investment was expected to have declined.Growth in retail sales volumes had been a bit below average in the September quarter. Information from liaison contacts suggested that retail conditions had been more favourable recently and a range of other indicators pointed to some strengthening in the pace of household consumption growth since the middle of the year. Measures of consumer sentiment showed that perceptions of personal finances relative to a year earlier had been above average, consistent with low interest rates, lower oil prices and stronger employment growth. Motor vehicle sales to households had been on a steeper upward trend since the beginning of 2015.The available data suggested that dwelling investment had increased in the September quarter. Building approvals remained at high levels, despite having eased somewhat since the start of the year. This was consistent with the expectation of further increases in dwelling investment in coming quarters, albeit at a gradually declining rate.In the established housing market, auction clearance rates and housing price growth had declined over recent months in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Prices were declining in Perth and rising moderately in much of the rest of the country. Members observed that the growth of total housing credit had been little changed. The easing in housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne and apparently lower growth in lending for the purpose of investor housing had followed an earlier tightening in lending terms, partly in response to supervisory measures announced by the Australian  Prudential  (L:PRU) Regulation Authority. It was still too early to assess the effect of the modest increase in lenders' mortgage rates in November (for both investors and owner-occupiers) on the housing market.Mining investment was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter and further declines were expected in the period ahead, with the largest subtraction from growth expected to occur in the current financial year. Non-mining investment was estimated to have been little changed over the year to the September quarter. Investment intentions reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey – which covers only around half of non-mining investment – continued to point to a decline in non-mining investment in 2015/16, and non-residential building approvals had remained at relatively low levels. In contrast, survey measures of business conditions continued to improve and were clearly above average, in particular for the household services and business services sectors, whose output was generally less capital intensive than other sectors. Business credit had increased further in October.Conditions in the non-mining sector had also been supported by further growth in net service exports, consistent with the depreciation of the exchange rate. Resource exports had rebounded in the September quarter, following earlier disruptions to bulk commodity exports owing to unfavourable weather and unanticipated shutdowns of some liquefied natural gas facilities.Employment growth had been strong in October and the unemployment rate had declined to 5.9 per cent, although in trend terms it remained in the 6–6¼ per cent range it had been in since the middle of 2014. Members observed that unemployment rates for most states were in the range of 5½–6½ per cent. Measures of job vacancies and advertisements pointed to continued growth in employment over the coming months. Wage inflation had remained subdued in the September quarter, consistent with spare capacity in the labour market and the forecast for a prolonged period of weak wage growth. The latest data suggested that wage growth had been little changed in the household services sector, where employment growth had been strongest.
Financial Markets
Members' discussion of financial markets commenced with Australian developments. Although questions remained over the quality of housing credit data disaggregated by the categories of investors and owner-occupiers, there were signs that lending for housing to investors had eased and lending to owner-occupiers had picked up a little. Significant reclassifications of loans to investors to loans to owner-occupiers in recent months, reversing some of the reclassifications earlier in the year, made determining the current rate of growth of the two categories difficult. Most mid-sized housing lenders in Australia had increased their standard variable lending rates by 15–20 basis points in November, despite not being subject to the same capital increases on housing loans as the major banks. Overall, by the end of November, housing loan rates for owner-occupiers had risen to their levels around the middle of the year, while those for investors had risen by more, to be back to their levels at the beginning of the year. Members noted that strong competition in the banking sector meant that business lending rates had remained at historic lows for both small and large businesses.Yields on money market instruments in Australia at the end of November implied only a small probability of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting.Internationally, the divergent outlooks for monetary policy in the United States and Europe continued to be the main driver of financial market developments. In the United States, market expectations of a rise in the federal funds rate in December had increased over the past month following stronger-than-expected labour force data, such that pricing implied at least a three-in-four chance of a rate rise at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. In Europe, further stimulus was thought likely at the ECB's next policy meeting in December. In Japan, expectations remained that further stimulus would be provided by the Bank of Japan, even though that had not been signalled at the most recent policy meetings.The differing expectations for monetary policy in the major economies had been reflected in higher US Treasury yields over the past month and German short-end yields declining to a historically low level of −0.4 per cent. Members noted that around half of outstanding German sovereign bonds were trading with negative yields, as was a significant share of other European sovereigns.The differing outlooks for monetary policies among the major jurisdictions were also apparent in exchange rates, with the US dollar appreciating over the past month while the euro and yen had both depreciated. The Chinese renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar. Members noted that the International Monetary Fund had approved the inclusion of the renminbi in the Special Drawing Right currency basket from 1 October 2016. In contrast to most other currencies, the Australian dollar had appreciated against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the past month to be a little above its recent lows.Global equity prices were little changed over November, but remained higher over the year. The Chinese market in particular had moved sharply in both directions, but showed little net change over the year to date. Australian equity prices had underperformed other developed equity markets over the course of 2015, weighed down by resources stocks, whose prices had fallen along with broad-based falls in commodity prices.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the available data suggested that the global economy continued to record moderate growth. Continued softness in demand growth in Asia had been associated with a further fall in commodity prices. At the same time, there had been further growth in the United States and a continued recovery in Europe. Monetary policy was accommodative in most economies, which, combined with the low level of oil prices, was expected to support growth in Australia's major trading partners over the next couple of years. Core inflation rates remained stable, but generally below central banks' targets.Members noted that recent domestic data had generally been positive. There continued to be evidence that very low interest rates were supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment, and the exchange rate was adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices and boosting demand for domestic production. This had translated into stronger employment growth and was consistent with surveys suggesting that business conditions were above average. Resource exports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth.Overall, the forecasts for the Australian economy were for output growth to strengthen gradually over the next two years as the drag on GDP growth from falling mining investment gradually diminished and activity progressively shifted to non-mining sectors of the economy. Business surveys suggested that there had been an improvement in conditions in non-mining sectors over the past year, which had been accompanied by stronger growth in employment and a steady rate of unemployment. Even so, members recognised that there was still evidence of spare capacity in the economy, including in the labour market. Wage growth remained low and underlying inflation was expected to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years.Credit growth had increased a little over recent months, as a result of business credit growth increasing. Growth in lending to investors in the housing market appeared to have eased, with a moderation in the pace of growth in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne over recent months. Housing price growth had mostly remained subdued in other cities. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing would reduce demand slightly, overall conditions remained quite accommodative. Members observed that supervisory measures had been helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market.Based on the available data and the forecasts, the Board decided that leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting was appropriate. Members judged that the outlook for inflation may afford some scope for a further easing of monetary policy should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. The Board would continue to assess the outlook, and hence whether the current stance of policy would most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in November, suggesting enough momentum in the economy for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week for the first time in nearly a decade.
Other data on Friday showed consumer sentiment nudged up in early December, an encouraging sign for future spending.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
""It dismisses any concerns of a potential slump in household spending after a couple of weaker months in August and September. Not that there is much doubt any more, but this supports the case for a rate hike by the Fed next week,"" said Steve Murphy, U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surprisingly slowed in the last few months. The moderation came despite a tightening labor market, which has started to lift household income.
Separately, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 91.8 early this month from a reading of 91.3 in November. 
The latest signs of strength in consumption prompted economists at  Barclays  (L:BARC) to bump up their fourth-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the third quarter.
In another report, the Commerce Department said retail inventories excluding autos increased 0.4 percent in October, suggesting inventories could be less of a drag on fourth-quarter growth than previously thought. That, however, implies inventories could weigh on output in early 2016.
Solid domestic demand in November supports expectations that the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting next Wednesday, despite weak inflation.
The U.S. central bank has not raised rates since June 2006. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt yields hit session lows.
PRODUCER PRICES RISE
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index advanced 0.3 percent last month after falling 0.4 percent in October. But the PPI declined 1.1 percent in the 12 months through November after sliding 1.6 percent in October.
November marked the 10th straight 12-month decrease in the index. Dollar strength and continued declines in oil prices amid a glut and slowing global growth have dampened price pressures, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed's 2 percent target.
""We maintain our conviction that dollar appreciation will weigh on the prices of core goods through the middle of next year,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays in New York. 
Last month, overall retail sales increased only 0.2 percent as automobile sales fell and cheaper gasoline weighed on receipts at service stations. Retail sales edged up 0.1 percent in October. 
Auto sales slipped 0.4 percent last month, the largest decline since June, after falling 0.3 percent in October. Though automakers reported strong sales in November, the units sold were slightly below October's levels. 
Receipts at service stations fell 0.8 percent after decreasing 1.0 percent in October. 
Elsewhere, sales at clothing stores shot up 0.8 percent, the largest increase since May. Sales at online retailers rose 0.6 percent and receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores increased 0.8 percent. Sales at electronics and appliance outlets advanced 0.6 percent.

The increase last month in discretionary spending suggested a fairly busy start to the holiday shopping season. However, receipts at building materials and garden equipment stores slipped 0.3 percent as did sales at furniture stores.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2015 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. retail inventories excluding autos rise in October,"WASHINGTON - U.S. retail inventories excluding automobiles rose in October, suggesting inventories
could be less of a drag on fourth-quarter growth than previously thought.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent in October after an unrevised 0.5 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Overall business inventories were unchanged in October after ticking up 0.1 percent the prior month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories edging up 0.1 percent in October after a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in September.
October's increase in retail inventories excluding autos could see economists raise their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates, currently around a 1.9 percent annual pace.
A record back-to-back increase in inventories in the first two quarters of this year left warehouses bulging with unsold merchandise and businesses with little appetite to restock.
Inventories subtracted 0.56 percentage point from GDP in the third quarter, holding the economy to a 2.1 percent growth pace.
However, data earlier this month showed downward revisions to September manufacturing and wholesale inventories, suggesting the third-quarter GDP growth estimate could be lowered when the government publishes its second revision later this month.
A report on Thursday also showed less spending on services
and software than the government had assumed in its second estimate for third-quarter GDP.
In October, business sales fell 0.2 percent after being flat in September.
At October's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.37 months in September.
That was the highest ratio since June 2009 and suggested that the so-called inventory correction could persist beyond the fourth quarter.

The Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index advanced 0.3 percent after falling 0.4 percent in October.
In the 12 months through November, the PPI declined 1.1 percent after sliding 1.6 percent in October. November marked the 10th straight 12-month decrease in the index.
Economists had forecast the PPI unchanged last month and sliding 1.4 percent from a year ago.
Dollar strength and continued declines in oil prices amid a glut and slowing global growth have dampened price pressures, leaving inflation running persistently below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
But given a tightening labor market, economists expect the U.S. central bank to raise its short-term interest rate next Wednesday for the first time in nearly a decade.
Producer inflation is likely to remain weak after a report
on Thursday showed import prices fell in November for the ninth time this year.
In November, services increased 0.5 percent after falling 0.3 percent the prior month. Nearly 80 percent of the increase was attributed to margins received by wholesalers and retailers, which jumped 1.2 percent.
Within services, more than 40 percent of the increase was due to a 6.2 percent increase in margins for apparel, jewelry, footwear, and accessories retailing. There were also gains in machinery and equipment wholesaling, loan services, fuels and lubricant retailing, and portfolio management.
However, prices for securities brokerage, dealing, investment advice, and related services fell 3.9 percent.
Energy prices fell 0.6 percent after being unchanged in October. Wholesale food prices rose 0.3 percent in November
after slipping 0.8 percent the prior month.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that
excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in October. The so-called

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose to a five-month high last week, but likely does not signal a deterioration in the labor market as the underlying trend remained consistent with tightening conditions.
Other data on Thursday showed cheaper crude oil and a strong dollar keeping imported inflation pressures subdued in November. The reports will probably do little to change views the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in nearly a decade.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ended Dec. 5, the highest level since early July, the Labor Department said.
Claims data tend to be volatile around this time of the year. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,500 to 270,750 last week.
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 40 straight weeks. This is the longest since the early 1970s.
As the labor market approaches full employment there is probably little room for further declines. The labor market remains resilient, despite slowing consumer spending and housing market activity.
Labor market tightness is expected to spur faster wage growth and gradually push inflation toward its target. The government reported last week that the economy added 211,000 jobs last month, keeping the unemployment rate at a 7-1/2-year low of 5.0 percent.
The claims report showed the number of people still
receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 82,000 to 2.24 million in the week ended Nov. 28. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 16,500 to 2.18 million.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.4 percent last month after decreasing 0.3 percent in October. Import prices have declined in 15 of the last 17months.
In the 12 months through November, prices tumbled 9.4percent. Dollar strength and a sharp decline in oil prices have dampened inflation, leaving it running well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Last month, imported petroleum prices fell 2.5 percent after rising 0.4 percent in October. Further weakness is likely following a recent slump in oil prices to seven-year lows. Import prices excluding petroleum slipped 0.3 percent after falling 0.4 percent in October. The dollar has gained 18 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, making imports less expensive. In November, imported food prices fell 0.5 percent, declining for a third straight month. Prices for industrial supplies, excluding petroleum fell 1.0 percent after a similar drop in October. Prices for imported capital goods dipped 0.1 percent and prices for imported automobiles also fell by the same margin.

The report also showed export prices decreased 0.6 percent last month after slipping 0.2 percent in October. They were down 6.3 percent in the 12 months through November.

The minutes showed eight members were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5%, in line with expectations and unchanged from the previous meeting.
Dissenting member Ian McCafferty voted for a 0.25% hike in the benchmark rate to 0.75% for the fourth consecutive month.
All nine members were in favor of making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.
According to the minutes, the majority of policymakers said low oil prices and subdued wage growth will keep a lid on inflation.
“There would need to be a sustained firming in domestic cost pressures, compared with current rates,” to push inflation back to the 2% target, officials said.
Inflation may turn positive in November, officials said, however “core inflation remains subdued.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories fell in October as businesses stepped up efforts to reduce stockpiles of unsold merchandise, suggesting inventories would again be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday wholesale inventories slipped 0.1 percent as stocks of both durable and nondurable goods fell. September inventories were revised down to show them increasing only 0.2 percent instead of rising 0.5 percent as previously reported.
Inventories help drive changes in gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP, wholesale stocks excluding autos, also dipped 0.1 percent. 
A record back-to-back increase in inventories in the first two quarters of this year left warehouses bulging with unsold merchandise and businesses with little appetite to restock. 
Inventories subtracted 0.56 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter. That restricted GDP growth to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent. 
The drop in wholesale inventories in October prompted economists to trim their fourth-quarter growth estimates by as much as two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.7 percent rate.
""We think that the drag from inventories in the fourth quarter will be more severe than we had previously believed,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York. 
Given downward revisions to September data, economists said they expected the third quarter GDP estimated would be lowered to a 1.9 percent pace when the government publishes its second revision later this month.
Data last week showed manufacturing inventories fell for a fourth straight month in October. Retail inventory data on Friday could shed more light on the magnitude of the anticipated inventory drag in the final three months of the year. 

Sales at wholesalers were unchanged in October after increasing 0.5 percent in September. Sales have been soft since last August, in part due to the negative impact of lower oil prices on the value of petroleum products sales At October's sales pace it would take 1.31 months to clearshelves, unchanged from September. This is a relatively high ratio and suggests that businesses are unlikely to ramp up their pace of inventory accumulation any time soon.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2015 01:11PM ET</span>",Sturdy U.S. employment report a green light for December rate hike,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased strongly in November in a show of the economy's resilience, which most likely paves the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month for the first time in nearly a decade.
Nonfarm payrolls rose 211,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. September and October data was revised to show 35,000 more jobs than previously reported.
The unemployment rate held at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent, even as people returned to the labor force in a sign of confidence in the jobs market. The jobless rate is in a range many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment and has dropped seven-tenths of a percentage point this year.
""The employment report should remove the final doubts about a rate hike at the December meeting. The clear message from the labor market to the Fed is: 'Just do it!'"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
The closely watched employment report came a day after Fed Chair Janet Yellen struck an upbeat note on the economy when she testified before lawmakers, describing how it had largely met the criteria the U.S. central bank has set for the Fed's first rate hike since June 2006.
Yellen said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population.
The Fed's policy-setting committee will meet on Dec. 15-16. Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations assign a probability of 79.1 percent to the central bank's raising interest rates at that meeting, according to the CME Group's (O:CME) FedWatch site.
U.S. Treasury debt prices initially fell on the data, but later reversed losses on news OPEC was raising its output ceiling despite lower oil prices. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks were trading higher.
BROAD GAINS
The second month of strong job gains should allay fears the economy has hit a soft patch, after reports showing tepid consumer spending in October and a slowdown in services industry growth in November. Manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years.
A strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies have taken some steam out of the economy. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit widened in October as exports hit a three-year low.
""Payroll gains were despite continued weakness in manufacturing and energy sectors, suggesting little spillover into the rest of the economy,"" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
Though wage growth slowed last month, economists say that was mostly payback for October's outsized gains, which were driven by a calendar quirk. Anecdotal evidence, as well as data on labor-related costs, suggest that tightening job market conditions are starting to put upward pressure on wages.
Average hourly earnings increased four cents, or 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent in October. That lowered the year-on-year reading to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent in October. The average workweek, however, dipped to 34.5 hours from 34.6.
Other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they consider lifting the benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero were mixed.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose to 62.5 percent from a near 38-year low of 62.4 percent.
But a broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 9.9 percent. That reflected an increase in part-time workers.
Employment gains in November were broad-based, though manufacturing shed 1,000 positions. Factory employment has declined in three of the last four months.
Manufacturing has been crippled by a strong dollar, efforts by businesses to reduce bloated inventory and spending cuts by energy companies scaling back well drilling and exploration in response to sharply lower oil prices.
Mining purged 11,000 jobs, with oil and gas extraction losing 2,400 positions. Mining employment has dropped by 123,000 since reaching a peak in December 2014. Three quarters of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining.
Oilfield services provider Schlumberger (N:SLB) this week announced another round of job cuts in addition to 20,000 layoffs already reported this year. The company said it expected the slowdown in drilling activity to continue in 2016.
Construction payrolls increased 46,000 last month, the largest gain since January 2014. Retail jobs rose 30,700 and transportation and warehousing employment rebounded after two straight months of declines.
Professional services added 27,000 jobs and government payrolls increased 14,000 last month.
""It's hard not to like today's reading on the labor market. We can anticipate further improvement ... next year,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

816,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 04, 2015 09:01AM ET</span>",US Adds More Jobs Than Expected,"By Angelo Young -

U.S. employers added a greater-than-expected 211,000 jobs in November while the employment rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 5 percent, its lowest level since March 2008, the Labor Department said Friday. November’s gain follows the best job-creation month of the year in October, whose number was revised upward Friday, from 271,000 to 298,000.
November’s robust reading means a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike later this month looks certain, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at New York-based ITG Investment Research, Inc.
“There’s isn’t a mystery about the possible Fed hike anymore. It’s a done deal,” Blitz said. “You would need a number like 100 to 125 thousand for the Fed to react at this point. August and September were down, but October pulled the moving average up again.”

Economists forecasted that Friday's report would show 200,000 more jobs were added last month and that the unemployment rate would hold steady at 5 percent, according to data firm FactSet.
The U.S. economy added 3.1 million jobs last year, or an average of about 258,000 a month, but with one months left to go, the 2015 number is about 2.3 million, or about 210,000 per month. The U.S. needs to create an average of 200,000 jobs a month to meet the demands of the U.S. workforce.

But the labor force participation rate -- a measure of the number of people who are employed, or are seeking employment – remains at a 38-year low. The figure ticked up only slightly, from 62.4 percent in October to 62.5 percent last month.
“We’ve been trying to figure out how much of the labor participation rate has to do with people entering retirement, but that doesn’t explain all of it,” said Tim Dreiling, senior portfolio manager for the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “It would be a good thing to see the unemployment rate begin to rise if it were in concert with more of these people finding work or starting to look for work.”"

818,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2015 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit widens as exports hit three-year low,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - - The U.S. trade deficit widened unexpectedly in October as exports fell to a three-year low, suggesting that trade could again weigh on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap rose 3.4 percent to $43.9 billion, a sign that the worst of the drag from a stronger dollar was far from over. September's trade deficit was revised up to $42.5 billion from the previously reported $40.8 billion. The government revised trade figures going back to April to incorporate more comprehensive and updated quarterly and monthly data.
Economists had forecast the trade gap shrinking to $40.5 billion in October. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit increased to $60.33 billion from $57.37 billion in September.
Trade subtracted 0.22 percentage point from gross domestic product in the third quarter, which expanded at a 2.1 percent annual rate. The dollar's 18.6 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014 has eroded export growth.
Exports fell 1.4 percent to $184.1 billion, the lowest level since October 2012. Exports of goods were the lowest since June 2011. Food exports were the lowest since March 2012, while exports of industrial supplies and materials were the weakest in five years. Petroleum exports hit their lowest level since December 2010.
Imports dipped 0.6 percent to $228.0 billion in October. Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell to the lowest level since May 2009. Petroleum imports were the lowest since November 2003, reflecting increased domestic energy production and lower oil prices.

The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 9.1 percent to $33.0 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed in November but remained at levels consistent with a steady pace of economic growth for the fourth quarter, a business survey showed on Thursday. 
Other data reported a small increase in first-time applications for unemployment benefits last week, but planned job cuts announced by companies in November were the fewest in 14 months.
With the labor market showing resilience, economists say it is almost certain the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at the Dec. 15-16 meeting for the first time in nearly a decade.
""It will take some pretty bad economic numbers for the Fed to pull back from the brink,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Thursday that the U.S. central bank was close to lifting its key overnight interest rate from near zero. Yellen gave an upbeat view of the economy, saying ""growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market."" 
The U.S. Institute for Supply Management on Thursday said its index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 55.9 last month from a reading of 59.1 in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector.
The new orders index dropped fell 4.5 points to 57.5 last month. There were also declines in measures of services sector employment, backlogs and export orders. Deliveries are slowing and inventories are still considered high which could constrain order growth in the months ahead. 
Twelve services industries, including real estate, retail, transportation and warehousing, finance and insurance, and public administration reported growth last month. The six industries reporting contraction included wholesale trade, utilities and agriculture.
The report came after news this week from ISM that the manufacturing sector contracted in November for the first time in three years. Still, economists said the soft services sector survey did not signal a slowdown in gross domestic product growth from the third quarter's 2.1 percent annual rate.
""Even after this drop off, the latest figure was still consistent with real GDP growth of around 2.25 percent,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
There was little market reaction to the U.S. economic data, but the U.S. dollar dropped to a near one-month low against the euro after the European Central Bank unveiled a smaller interest rate cut and bond purchases than investors had anticipated. U.S. stocks and Treasury debt prices were trading lower.
LABOR MARKET RESILIENCE
In second report, the U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 269,000 in the week ended Nov. 28. It was the 39th straight week that claims held below 300,000, which is normally associated with a healthy labor market. Claims are near levels last seen in 1973 and there is little room for further declines as the labor market normalizes. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a bettermeasure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-weekvolatility, fell 1,750 to 269,250 last week. 
In a third report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. said U.S.-based firms announced 30,953 job cuts in November, the smallest amount since September 2014 and down 39 percent from October. There were 1,355 oil-related job cuts, the fewest since June. 
Last week's jobless claims have no bearing on Friday's U.S. Labor Department employment report for November as they fall outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 200,000 last month after rising 271,000 in October. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent.
""The claims data suggest that the trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

In a fourth report, the U.S. Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.5 percent after two straight months of declines, on rising demand for transportation equipment and a range of other goods.[nLNN3NEBJ0]

839,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2015 10:10AM ET</span>",Transportation buoys U.S. factory orders in October,"WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - - New orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded in October after two straight months of declines, but manufacturing remains crippled by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.5 percent on rising demand for transportation equipment and a range of other goods. Orders in September were revised to show them falling 0.8 percent instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent drop.
Despite the increase in orders last month, manufacturing remains mired in weakness, with a survey this week showing the sector contracting last month for the first time in three years.
Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is also being undermined by business efforts to reduce an inventory overhang and tepid global demand.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 1.4 percent in October. The dollar has gained 18.6 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, which has eroded export growth and undercut the profits of multinationals.
In October, orders for transportation equipment increased 7.9 percent, largely reflecting a rise in aircraft orders. They had declined 2.2 percent in September. Motor vehicle orders fell 2.0 percent.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – rose 1.3 percent as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.5 percent in October instead of the 0.4 percent drop reported last month.
Inventories of factory goods dipped 0.1 percent, dropping for a fourth straight month. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio unchanged at a still lofty 1.35, a sign that the inventory drawdown could extend through the fourth quarter.

Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.3 percent, after two consecutive months of declines. Shipments fell 0.5 percent. They have dropped in six of the last seven months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers boosted hiring in November and wage growth appeared to pick up in the third quarter, signs of labor market strength that could support the first Federal Reserve interest rate increase in nearly a decade later this month.
The reports on Wednesday overshadowed slumping manufacturing activity and underscored the economy's solid fundamentals.
""The data indicate a steady improvement in the labor market that should support the Fed's confidence that now is the right time to hike rates,"" said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Bank in New York.
Private payrolls increased 217,000 last month on top of the 196,000 jobs added in October, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Employment gains were fairly healthy across the board, with manufacturing rebounding from two straight months of shedding jobs. The sector added 6,000 positions in November.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday. 
Though the ADP report is not considered a reliable predictor of nonfarm payrolls, economists said it was broadly in line with their expectations for solid job gains in November. According to a Reuters survey, nonfarm payrolls increased 200,000 in November after surging 271,000 in October. Job growth is more than enough to keep up with population growth.
The Federal Reserve has signaled its intention to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero at its Dec. 15-16 meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen could offer more clues on the near-term monetary policy outlook when she addresses the Economic Club of Washington at 12:25 p.m. ET (1725 GMT).
The U.S. central bank last raised interest rates in June 2006. Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations assign a probability of 75 percent to the central bank raising interest rates this month, according to the CME Group's FedWatch site. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. government bond yields rose, with the 2-year Treasury note (US2YT=RR), the most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, hitting a session high above 0.94 percent. U.S. stocks were little changed.
Labor strength should help ease concerns about the economy after a report on Tuesday showed manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years.
WAGES ACCELERATING
A separate report from the Labor Department suggested wage growth, which has been frustratingly slow even as labor market conditions tighten, could be finally accelerating. 
Compensation per hour in the third quarter rose at a 4.0 percent annual rate, and not the 3.0 percent pace the department had reported last month. Compensation was up a solid 3.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, was also revised higher to show it increasing at a 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.4 percent pace. 
""The figures in today's report support the idea that wage inflation has picked up lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
While productivity growth, which measures hourly output per worker, was revised up to a 2.2 percent rate in the third quarter, the trend remained weak. Productivity was previously reported to have expanded at a 1.6 percent pace.
It increased only 0.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014, the slowest rise in nearly a year.

Economists blame softer productivity on lack of investment, which they say has led to an unprecedented decline in capital intensity. They say persistently tepid productivity has lowered the economy's speed limit.

The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, in line with expectations.
Global economic growth is evolving essentially as the Bank had anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report.
In Canada, the dynamics of growth have been broadly in line with the Bank’s MPR outlook. The economy continues to undergo a complex and lengthy adjustment to the decline in Canada’s terms of trade.
The resource sector is still contending with lower prices for commodities. In non-resource sectors, exports are picking up, particularly in exchange rate-sensitive categories. However, business investment continues to be weighed down by cuts in resource-sector spending.
The Bank expects GDP growth to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2015 before moving to a rate above potential in 2016.
In the midst of all of these adjustments, inflation is in line with the Bank’s October outlook. Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the Bank’s target range, owing to declines in consumer energy prices. Core inflation is close to 2% as the effects of the lower dollar and the output gap continue to offset each other.
The Bank judges that the risks around the inflation profile remain roughly balanced over the projection horizon. Vulnerabilities in the household sector continue to edge higher while overall risks to financial stability are evolving as expected.
Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 190,000 jobs.
Private payroll gains in October were revised up to 196,000from an originally reported 182,000 increase.
The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics. The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. 
Economists polled by Reuters are projecting the Labor Department's report to show U.S. employers hired 200,000 workers in November. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold at 5.0 percent. 
""The current pace of job creation is twice that needed to absorb growth in the working age population,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. ""The economy is fast approaching full employment and will be there no later than next summer.""
Employment gains were relatively healthy also across businesses when measured by size, with small employers adding 81,000 jobs, medium-sized companies adding 62,000 and large businesses adding 74,000 workers. Within the large business segment, companies with between 500 and 999 workers hired a record 57,000 people in November, according to the report.
The services sector added 204,000 jobs, while goods-producing companies hired 13,000 new workers.
The strength of the report contributed to a push higher in bond yields as traders positioned for an ever-more-likely rate hike by the Fed on Dec. 16. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US2YT=RR), the most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, rose to a session high above 0.94 percent.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday that productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.2 percent annual rate and not the 1.6 percent pace it had reported last month. Productivity expanded at a 3.5 percent rate in the second quarter.
The revision to third-quarter productivity was in line with economists' expectations and reflected upward adjustments to the
third-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last week. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the July-September period.
Productivity increased only 0.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014, underscoring the weakness in the trend. While that was marginally up from the 0.4 percent reported in November, it was the slowest rise in nearly a year.
Economists blame softer productivity on lack of investment, which they say has led to an unprecedented decline in capital
intensity. While weak productivity has boosted employment growth as companies hired more workers to increase output, economists
say it has contributed to stagnant wages and lowered the economy's speed limit. 
Economists say persistently tepid productivity could continue to limit wage growth even as the labor market approaches full employment.
In the third quarter, hours worked fell at a 0.3 percent rate, rather than the 0.5 percent decline reported in November. It was still the first drop since the third quarter of 2009 and reflected a decline in self-employment. 
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.4 percent pace. Unit labor costs rose at a 2.0 percent rate in the second quarter.

They were up 3.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. Compensation per hour rose at a 4.0 percent rate in the third quarter, revised up from the 3.0 percent pace reported last month. Compensation was up 3.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014.

869,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 02, 2015 06:31AM ET</span>",Weak Eurozone Inflation Bolsters Case For Further Policy Easing,"By Avaneesh Pandey -

Consumer prices in the 19-nation eurozone rose 0.1 percent year-on-year in November, according to data released Wednesday by Eurostat -- the European Union's statistics agency. The figure, which is the same as October's and slightly below analysts’ expectations of a 0.2 percent hike, raises chances that the European Central Bank (ECB) will ease monetary policy further during its meeting Thursday.
The weaker-than-expected rise in consumer prices were, once again, largely due to a slump in energy prices, which dropped 7.3 percent year-on-year in November. Core inflation -- which excludes energy, food and tobacco -- rose an estimated 0.9 percent in November, down from a 1.1 percent hike in October.
Wednesday’s inflation figures are the latest in a series of data that have underscored the region’s gradually improving, albeit delicate, economy. The recent run of tepid economic data has increased pressure on the ECB to unveil further measures to boost growth and raise inflation, either by stepping up its bond-buying program, or by further reducing its already negative interest rates.
“Regardless of the data, the ECB cannot afford to disappoint on Thursday,” Marco Valli, chief euro-area economist at UniCredit SpA in Milan, told Bloomberg. “The stage has been set for [ECB chief] Draghi to take action.
In a bid to bring consumer prices closer to the 2 percent goal and to boost the bloc’s economy, the ECB in March embarked on a 1.1 trillion euro ($1.2 trillion) asset-purchase program. The bond purchases are slated to run at least through September 2016. However, in recent weeks, Draghi has primed the markets and investors for further actions, reiterating that the bank will do whatever it must to boost inflation.
Meanwhile, the euro -- which recently hit a seven-month low of $1.0566 -- continued to perform weakly against the dollar. The euro area currency was last at $1.059 at 6:11 a.m. EST.
European equities, on the other hand, began trading higher Wednesday after a flat open, as investors reacted to the weak inflation figures.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 was trading up 0.5 percent, while London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.5 percent. France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX index were both up 0.3 percent."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years as the sector buckled under the weight of a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms, but robust automobile sales suggested the economy remained on solid ground.
Other data released on Tuesday showed a sturdy increase in construction spending in October, which should help offset the drag from manufacturing on fourth-quarter economic growth. With manufacturing accounting for only 12 percent of the economy, analysts say it is unlikely the persistent weakness will deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this month.
""Manufacturing is being pummeled by the stronger dollar and the weakness of global demand, but the other 88 percent of the economy continues to perform well. This won't prevent the Fed from raising interest rates at the mid-December meeting,"" said Steve Murphy, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Institute for Supply Management said its national factory index fell to 48.6 last month, the weakest reading since June 2009 when the recession ended, from 50.1 in October. While a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, the index remains above 43.1, which is associated with a recession. 
Factory activity has also been undercut by business efforts to reduce an excessive inventory build, which is putting pressure on new orders. The ISM said a gauge of new orders tumbled 4 percentage points to 48.9 last month.
Inventories at manufacturers continued to shrink and their customers reported stocks of unsold goods were too high for a fourth consecutive month. 
Ten out of 18 manufacturing industries, including apparel, machinery, primary metals, electrical equipment, appliances and components and computer and electronic products reported contraction in November. Five industries reported growth. 
Manufacturers cited dollar strength, slower Chinese and European growth and lower oil prices as headwinds. Recent data on business capital spending plans and factory output had offered hope that the worst of the sector's woes were over. 
But with auto sales and construction spending remaining robust early in the fourth quarter, economists still expect U.S. gross domestic product to expand at around a 2 percent annual pace, almost matching the third-quarter pace.
Though November auto sales dipped to a seasonally adjusted annualized 18.19 million-unit pace from October's brisk 18.24 million rate, according to Autodata Corp, they kept the industry on track for record sales this year.
STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND
""The good news is that the much more important services sector continues to do very well, benefiting from solid domestic demand. In that environment, the Fed will begin to raise interest rates at the upcoming meeting,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
Fed officials meet on Dec. 15-16 and are expected to raise benchmark rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks ended higher.
In a separate report the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 1.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.11 trillion rate, the highest since December 2007, after rising 0.6 percent in September.
Construction outlays were up 13 percent compared to October of last year. Spending in October was buoyed by a 0.8 percent rise in private spending, which touched its highest level since January 2008. Outlays on private residential construction hit their highest since December 2007.
Investment in private non-residential construction projects rose 0.6 percent to a near seven-year high, with spending on manufacturing plants rising a robust 3 percent. 
Public construction outlays jumped 1.4 percent to a five-year high as a surge in federal government spending offset a dip in investment by state and local governments. 

""Despite the free fall in oil patch activity, total construction in the rest of the economy is doing quite well,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose last month on strength in sport utility vehicles and marketing promotions, while industry sales were forecast topping 18 million vehicles on an annualized basis, which would be the strongest November ever.
General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday the U.S. auto industry will sell 18.2 million vehicles for the month at an annualized rate. Most analysts predicted 2015 sales will top the record of 17.35 million vehicles in 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
End-of-year holiday promotions were pushed into November as automakers emphasized Black Friday deals tied to the Thanksgiving U.S. holiday, said Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds.com.
Consumers were attracted by such promotions as zero percent financing, even as incentives were not greatly increased.
""Incentives were strong for the Black Friday weekend but I think it was more of the messaging than substance. Still, it looks like consumers took the deals,"" said Jeff Schuster, forecaster for LMC Automotive.
GM's sales rose 1.5 percent. GM, like most automakers, showed gains for SUVs but losses for sedan sales.

 Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said its Ram pickup sales were up 2 percent.
Ford ended a sales promotion offering employee pricing, but analysts said the deal confused consumers who wanted more traditional promotions. Ford introduced a new holiday program offering $1,000 cash and zero-percent financing for five years. Ford sales rose 0.4 percent for the month.
Ford said it expects continued strong pickup sales overall despite a drop in the Dallas area, compared to increases in other major metropolitan areas.
Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) U.S. sales in November fell 25 percent as it coped with a scandal over diesel emissions cheating.

Construction spending increased 1.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.11 trillion rate, the highest level since December 2007, after an unrevised 0.6 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.

Brazil’s economy shrank 1.7 percent in the third quarter following a 1.9 percent decrease in the April to June quarter, according to media reports. This is the third straight quarter of economic downturn for the largest economy in the Latin America region.
Economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted Brazil’s GDP would contract by 1.2 percent. It's reportedly the first time that the country has suffered three consecutive quarters of negative growth since the 1990s. Rising unemployment and higher inflation reportedly sapped domestic demand during the third quarter.
""While a sharp drop in volatile agricultural output slightly exaggerates the third quarter's contraction, Brazil's economy is as bad as the headline numbers look,"" Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group (N:PNC), said, in an emailed statement.
In recent months a nationwide corruption investigation, including at state-backed oil company Petrobras, has reportedly caused political gridlock, delaying President Dilma Rousseff's efforts to pass measures to fortify fiscal accounts and revive confidence.
Brazil's currency, the real, was reportedly steady in early trading Tuesday, after suffering a series of losses following as a result of the Petrobras corruption scandal.
""A stabilization in inflation could create room for the central bank to cut interest rates by mid 2016, potentially laying groundwork for a return to growth next year,"" Adams said, adding that ""the weak competitiveness of Brazil's non-commodity sectors and the persistence of low global commodity prices"" could make a recovery tougher."

SHANGHAI -- Latest official data from China show a further contraction in manufacturing activity among major companies in November, in another sign of the impact of the global slowdown on the world’s second largest economy. China’s official Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which measures activity at larger companies, many of them state-owned, fell to its lowest point since August 2012, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.
The figure of 49.6 marked a further fall from October’s 49.8, and the fourth month the PMI index had been in negative territory, state media reported. Any reading below 50 suggests a contraction. Analysts said the figure was worse than expected, suggesting continuing pressure on China’s manufacturers, which have been hit as the country’s exports have fallen in recent months. China's GDP growth dipped below 7 percent in the last quarter for the first time since 2009. And despite more positive PMI figures for China’s service industries, several economists predicted that the Chinese government would have to take further stimulus measures to boost the economy.
Significantly, the latest manufacturing data also suggests that domestic demand, which the government hopes will rise to offset China's export slowdown, may also be declining. The sub-index tracking new orders for China’s manufacturing companies showed that while export demand remained weakest, at 46.4, overall orders, from both home and abroad, also fell back into negative territory in November, down to 49.8 from 50.3 in October.
There was slightly better news, however, from the separate Caixin China PMI, which mainly measures smaller and private companies. It has fallen even lower than the official index in recent months, and remained in negative territory for the ninth straight month, at 48.6, in November. However the figure marked an improvement from October's 48.3, confounding predictions that it would remain unchanged. It was the second monthly improvement in a row.
Caixin Insight Group, which compiles the index, said demand for exports from the surveyed companies -- usually seen as the most flexible sector of China’s economy, but often vulnerable to falls in export demand -- actually grew in November, at the fastest rate in more than a year. And it said factories’ output had stabilized for the first time in six months. However, it also said that domestic demand was weak, with companies still laying off workers -- though at their slowest pace since May.
He Fan, chief economist of Caixin Insight Group, said the figures suggested that “pressure on economic growth has eased and fiscal policy has had a strong effect,” a reference to the government increasing spending on infrastructure projects in recent months. And he said China’s economy was “on track to become more stable.”
However, He also noted that the prices for both the inputs and outputs of China’s factories fell in November, adding to concern about deflationary pressure on the economy. China’s consumer price index rose just 1.3 percent year-on-year in October, while the producer price index was down 5.9 percent. And Li-gang Liu and Louis Lam, Greater China economists at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong, said in a report that falling prices would hit companies' profits.
They noted that China's industrial profits fell sharply, by 4.6 percent year-on-year in October. And they predicted that the authorities would “further ease monetary policy and continue to implement an expansionary fiscal policy in order to prevent further slowdown of the economy in 2016."" Some observers expect further cuts in interest rates and bank's reserve requirement ratio -- which has been cut several times in the past year -- to encourage lending to businesses.
Liu and Lam said there were a few bright spots in China's economy, with profits for high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing up significantly in October. And the official PMI survey also showed signs of continuing improvement in China's non-manufacturing economy, with sectors such as services and construction expanding faster compared to October, at 52.8 and 58.1 respectively. Sectors such as delivery received a particular boost in November from China’s Singles’ Day, the world’s largest online retail festival, while financial services and software continue to grow, according to official reports, and the PMI for new orders in the non-manufacturing sector also continued to rise. 
It’s further evidence of what leading economist Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM), recently described as China’s ""two-track economy."" Speaking at a recent conference of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Zhu predicted that China's service sector, which has continued to see double-digit growth this year, would carry on growing healthily, while manufacturing slowed.
China's house prices also rose again in November, up nearly 3 percent year-on-year in 100 major cities, and 7.6 percent in China’s 10 biggest cities, according to a new survey. And some experts continue to predict a possible rebound in GDP growth to about 7 percent in the final quarter of the year.
However, many economists at home and abroad agree that further measures need to be taken if China is to avoid a ""hard landing"" as its economy slows, and more infrastructure spending is likely to be announced in the coming months -- though the government has suggested it will try to fund some of this by public-private partnerships."

The Australian and Indian central banks on Tuesday kept their benchmark interest rates unchanged ahead of an impending rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this month. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept interest rates at its all-time low of 2 percent as an improvement in non-mining sectors and a robust labor market helped offset a decline in its vast mining sector. The move was widely anticipated by economists, according to a Bloomberg poll that interviewed 29 economists on the subject.
“The board again judged that the prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months and that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate,” RBA governor Glenn Stevens said. “Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending.”
Earlier in November, the RBA governor had reportedly told traders to ""chill out"" until February, when policy makers will look at the data again. Australia cut its interest rates twice this year in a bid to shift the economy’s dependence on mining and commodities.
Interest rates are kept low by central banks when a nation’s economy is in a lull to encourage consumer borrowing and spending through lower interest rates charged on personal, auto or mortgage loans. In Australia, last week's weak third-quarter capital expenditure data suggested that economic activity has been sluggish, even as the jobs market continues to improve, according to reports.
 The bank also indicated that inflation was expected to remain low and stable in 2016. “The outlook for inflation may afford scope for further easing of policy,” the bank said in a statement.
Australia will report GDP growth data for the third quarter Wednesday. Economists are now reportedly expecting a robust result underpinned by a strong export performance. Still, the economy faces stiff headwinds in the form of falling business investment and falling prices of iron ore -- Australia’s biggest export.
""We remain optimistic about local growth, but pessimistic about the global inflation outlook,"" Paul Bloxham, chief Australia economist at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA)., told the Financial Review. 
In a separate announcement Tuesday, India’s central bank also kept its monetary policy steady amid uncertainty over inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had cut its interest rates by a sharp 50-basis points at its last meet. The RBI held off on a rate cut after GDP data announced Monday showed a 7.4 percent growth during the second quarter helped by a surging manufacturing sector.
The Indian central bank is expected to maintain an ""accommodative"" policy stance, according to various estimates, and a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) research report also predicted a 25-basis point cut in February."

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some softening in conditions in the Asian region, continuing US growth and a recovery in Europe. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, reflecting increased supply, including from Australia, as well as weaker demand. Australia's terms of trade are falling.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease monetary policy. Volatility in financial markets has abated somewhat for the moment. While credit costs for some emerging market countries remain higher than a year ago, global financial conditions overall remain very accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues in the face of a large decline in capital spending in the mining sector. While GDP growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, business surveys suggest a gradual improvement in conditions in non-mining sectors over the past year. This has been accompanied by stronger growth in employment and a steady rate of unemployment.
Inflation is low and should remain so, with the economy likely to have a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. Inflation is forecast to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing will reduce this support slightly, overall conditions are still quite accommodative. Credit growth has increased a little over recent months, with credit provided by intermediaries to businesses picking up. Growth in lending to investors in the housing market has eased. Supervisory measures are helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market.
The pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney over recent months and has remained mostly subdued in other cities. In other asset markets, prices for commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices have moved in parallel with developments in global markets. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
At today's meeting the Board again judged that the prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months and that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate. Members also observed that the outlook for inflation may afford scope for further easing of policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. The Board will continue to assess the outlook, and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2015 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales rise modestly in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose far less than expected in October, the latest sign that the housing market recovery was losing momentum after strong gains early this year. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its pending home sales index edged up 0.2 percent to 107.7. While the increase ended two straight months of declines, it was far below economists' expectations for a 1.0 percent rebound. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's small gain suggested home resales will probably not bounce back after falling 3.4 percent in October. 
Also coming on the heels of weak housing starts in October and a dip in homebuilders confidence in November, the report suggested a moderation in housing activity. Home sales are being constrained by tight inventories, which are pushing up prices.

Pending home sales are up 3.9 percent from a year ago. Contracts increased 4.5 percent in the Northeast and rose 1.7percent in the West. They dropped 1.7 percent in the South and fell 1.0 percent in the Midwest.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.5%.
Pending home sales in September fell by 1.6%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 2.3%.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 2.1% in October, below forecasts for an increase of 4.5% and following a gain of 3.2% in the prior month.
Gains in the Northeast and West were offset by declines in the Midwest and South.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says pending sales have plateaued this fall as buyers struggle to overcome a scant number of available homes for sale and prices that are rising too fast in some markets.
""Contract signings in October made the most strides in the Northeast, which hasn't seen much of the drastic price appreciation and supply constraints that are occurring in other parts of the country,"" he said.

Japan’s economy showed initial signs of a recovery as the production of electronic devices and cars boosted industrial output in October, according to preliminary trade ministry data released Monday. Industrial output rose for the second consecutive month while monthly retail sales in the island nation also showed a modest uptick.
The data showed October factory output rose 1.4 percent from September, driven by a higher demand for Japanese cars and electronics, and underlining analysts’ expectations that the economy is reportedly headed for a minor rebound in the October-December quarter.
Japan’s economy slid into a technical recession after its GDP shrank for a second straight quarter in September -- the country’s second in as many years. According to data released last week, household spending and consumer inflation also weakened, piling pressure on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to ramp up its already massive stimulus.
While the growth in industrial production indicated that Japan’s recession may be temporary, the trade ministry was cautious in its forecast for the rest of the year. Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 0.2 percent in November and decrease 0.9 percent in December.
Retail sales proved to be another bright spot in October, separate data released Monday showed. Retail sales were up 1.8 percent in the year to October as sales of clothes, food and drink, cars and home appliances drove growth.
""Fine weather and a rise in Chinese tourists helped spur retail sales, which have held firm since summer despite some weakness in items such as home appliances,"" Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Reuters.
Government data released Friday showed that while unemployment in the country fell to a two-decade low in October, tight labor markets restricted wage growth -- a key influencer of consumer spending and inflation. The data on wages cast doubts over the BoJ’s inflation target of 2 percent by early 2017. It has also raised questions over the viability of the “Abenomics” approach to recovery -- named after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’s policies -- which involves pumping large quantities of cash into the economy to boost spending."

Growth in the United Kingdom slowed to 0.5 percent in the quarter ending Sept. 30, down from a 0.7 percent expansion seen in the previous quarter, data released Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed.
On a yearly basis, the country’s economy grew 2.3 percent in the third quarter of the year, the second estimate of GDP growth showed, in line with an initial estimate released late last month. The data marks 11 consecutive months of positive growth in the U.K., and its longest stretch of growth since the 2009 financial crisis, ONS said, in a statement accompanying the GDP figures.
Net trade wiped 1.5 percentage points off GDP -- the biggest negative impact on record, which dates back to 1997. Gains from exports, which rose 0.9 percent, were overshadowed by a 5.5 percent rise in imports -- as a strong currency reduced export volumes and cooled foreign demand.
While output in the three main sectors -- services, manufacturing and agriculture -- increased in the third quarter, industrial output was weaker than expected, growing by just 0.2 percent and down from the previous estimate of 0.3 percent. Growth in the construction sector dropped by 2.2 percent after a 1.4 percent increase in the previous quarter.
A rise in household spending in the third quarter -- which rose 0.8 percent on a quarterly basis and 3.1 percent over the same quarter last year -- helped offset a massive trade deficit, government data showed.
Earlier this month, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of risks to the economy from weaknesses in emerging markets and said that record-low interest rates in the U.K. are likely to continue “for some time.” However, he also said that domestic demand remained robust -- buoyed, in part, by low inflation and a pickup in wage growth."

MANILA -- The Philippine economy grew less than expected in the third quarter, dragged by industry and agriculture and the first drop in remittances from overseas Filipinos in years. It was still the third-fastest growing economy in Asia after China and Vietnam.
Gross domestic product expanded 6 percent, compared with 5 percent and 5.8 percent in the first two quarters, respectively, the Philippine Statistics Authority said. Economists had expected 6.2 percent, according to various surveys.
With nine-month growth at 5.6 percent, the government said it could still hit 6 percent for the full year. Its 7 percent target, however, is out of reach.
Strength came from government spending, which shot up 17 percent. Services gained 7.3 percent and consumer spending grew 6.3 percent. The drags were industry and exports, both up 5.4 percent, and agriculture, up just 0.4 percent. Exports were damped by the weak global economy. Farms were hurt by the combination of the El Nino dry spell and several strong typhoons.
""Weak global demand will drag on GDP growth even as the domestic economy remains pretty solid,"" said  Credit Suisse  (VX:CSGN) economist Michael Wan, according to Bloomberg. ""Services, consumption are still very strong and the growth recovery momentum is intact.""
While consumer spending grew at the fastest pace in at least seven quarters, it could have been stronger. Remittances from overseas Filipinos fell in August for the first time since at least 2010. That resulted in a decline for the whole quarter. Remittances, which at $27 billion last year were about a tenth of the $285 billion economy, are estimated to have an outsize effect on the economy because the families that receive it spent much of it immediately."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in October as households took advantage of rising incomes to boost savings to their highest level in nearly three years, pointing to moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Anemic consumer spending will probably do little do change expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month as other data on Wednesday showed a surge in business spending plans in October and a drop in new applications for unemployment benefits last week.
""As far as fourth-quarter GDP goes, that is likely to keep estimates close to 2 percent. That's enough to justify a rate hike as long as next Friday's employment report is not a disaster,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after a similar increase in September. That suggests consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has slowed from the third quarter's brisk 3.0 percent annual pace. 
The tepid rise in consumer spending could combine with an anticipated drag from an ongoing inventory reduction to hold the economy to around a 2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.
But the economy, which expanded at a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter, could get support from business spending. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.3 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in September.
Coming on the heels of data this month showing a solid increase in manufacturing output in October, it suggested the worst of the drag from a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms was over. 
Fed officials had held off raising rates at their last two meetings as they assessed the degree to which dollar strength and a slowing in economies overseas would weigh on the United States. 
""The surge in core capital goods orders could be a crucial signal that this important sector of the economy may be at a turning point, further bolstering the Fed's confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector. The dollar has appreciated 18.1 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
The pace of appreciation, however, is gradually slowing. Economists also believe that the bulk of spending cuts by oil field firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) in response to lower crude prices have already been implemented. 
U.S. Treasury debt prices pared gains after the reports, while the dollar hit an eight-month high against a basket of currencies.
WAGES RISING
Economists speculate that rising rents are diverting money from discretionary spending. While consumer sentiment increased in November from October, households continued to fret over their financial prospects, another report showed.
But as the labor market continues to tighten, there is optimism that wage growth will pick up and encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings and boost spending.
A fourth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Nov. 21. Claims have now held below the 300,000 threshold for 38consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and remain close to levels last seen in the early 1970s.
Strengthening labor market conditions are gradually lifting income. The Commerce Department said personal income increased 0.4 percent last month, accelerating after a 0.2 percent gain in September. Wages and salaries shot up 0.6 percent, the largest increase since May. 
Savings increased to $761.9 billion last month, the highest level since December 2012, from $722.9 billion in September. Higher savings could over time buoy consumer spending. 
There was still no sign of inflation, which has persistently run below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. 
A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in the 12 months through October after a similar rise in September. 
Excluding food and energy, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 1.3 percent for the 10th straight month.

In another report, the Commerce Department said new homes sales jumped 10.7 percent in October, which could allay concerns of a significant slowdown in housing.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Nov. 21, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. 
The prior week's claims were revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Claims have now held below the 300,000 threshold for 38 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and remain close to levels last seen in the early 1970s. Claims below this level are usually associated with a healthy jobs market.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 270,000 last week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no
special factors influencing the data and only claims for Louisiana had been estimated. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 271,000 last week.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 34,000
to 2.21 million in the week ended Nov. 14. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 15,250 to 2.18 million. The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for November's unemployment rate.
The four-week average of continuing claims rose 8,750 between the October and November survey periods, suggesting the
unemployment rate will likely hold at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a healthier clip in the third quarter than initially thought, but strong inventory accumulation by businesses could temper expectations of an acceleration in growth in the final three months of the year.
    The Commerce Department on Tuesday said the nation's gross domestic product grew at a 2.1 percent annual pace, not the 1.5 percent rate it reported last month, as businesses reduced an inventory bloat less aggressively than previously believed.
The pace of economic growth, which was also boosted by upward revisions to business spending on equipment, suggests a resilience that could help give the Federal Reserve confidence to raise interest rates next month. 
While consumer spending was revised down a bit, its pace remained brisk, suggesting consumers were cash-flush. 
""The economy continues to move along at a good clip relative to its potential. With growth like this, the Fed has the data it needs to light the candle finally and lift off on December 16,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a sturdy 3.1 percent clip, the fastest in a year and an acceleration from the second quarter's upwardly 2.2 percent pace. Wages and salaries increased $109.3 billion, $61.6 billion more than initially estimated.
    The third-quarter's respectable expansion should set up the economy to achieve at least 2 percent growth in the second half of the year, around its long-run potential. In the wake of robust job growth in October and strong domestic demand, the Fed is expected to raise rates at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.
Other data on Tuesday showed consumer confidence fell further in November, hitting a 14-month low, as sentiment towards the labor market surprisingly soured. Economists suspected the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and rising tensions in the Middle East had weighed on consumer confidence.
Despite the drop, more consumers say they plan to buy homes, automobiles and other big-ticket items over the next six months. 
""The bigger picture suggests that domestic demand is still firm, spending plans are evolving positively and the housing market continues to post gains,"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
A third report showed house prices rose solidly in August.
U.S. financial markers were little moved by the data as investors worried about global security after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane.
LARGE INVENTORY ACCUMULATION
In the third quarter, businesses accumulated $90.2 billion worth of inventories, instead of the $56.8 billion reported last month. That followed more than $100 billion worth of inventories accumulated in each of the prior two quarters.
As a result, the change in inventories chopped off only 0.59 percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth, rather than the 1.44 percentage points the government reported in October. 
    That, however, suggests inventories could be a drag on fourth-quarter growth. 
""The bigger inventory overhang helps explain why manufacturing sentiment remains cautious early in the fourth quarter, and does present downside risk to our 2.5 percent estimate for current-quarter GDP growth,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a still strong 3.0 percent rate in the third quarter, down from the 3.2 percent rate estimated last month. The downward revisions mostly reflected weak outlays on communication services and utilities.
A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government spending, was revised down to a still sturdy 3.1 percent pace from the previously 3.2 percent rate. Though there are signs consumer spending slowed early in the fourth quarter, it should continue to be supported by strong income gains. Income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose at a robust 3.9 percent pace in the third quarter.
A trade deficit that was larger than previously estimated subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter. Data on Tuesday showing a smaller goods trade deficit suggested trade would contribute to fourth-quarter growth.
Deep spending cuts by energy firms following a collapse in oil prices continued to weigh on growth. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts tumbled at a 47.1 percent rate, rather than the 46.9 percent pace reported last month. 
However, business spending on equipment was revised up to a 9.5 percent rate from a 5.3 percent pace.

The Commerce Department also reported that corporate profits after tax fell at a 1.6 percent rate in the third quarter after rising at a 2.6 percent pace in the second quarter.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence sank to 90.4 this month from a reading of 99.1 in October, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 97.6. Analysts expected the index to rise to 99.5 in November.
The Present Situation Index decreased from 114.6 last month to 108.1 in November, while the Expectations Index declined to 78.6 from 88.7 in October.
Commenting on the report, director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center Lynn Franco said, “The decline was mainly due to a less favorable view of the job market.""
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was October 15.

The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 5.5 percent in September on a year-over-year basis compared with 5.1 percent in the year to August. It was above the 5.1 percent estimate from a Reuters poll of economists.
""The general economy appeared to slow slightly earlier in the fall, but is now showing renewed strength. With unemployment at 5 percent and hints of higher inflation in the CPI, most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise its fed funds target range to 25 to 50 basis points, the first increase since 2006,"" said David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

""While this will make news, it is not likely to push mortgage rates far above the recent level of 4 percent on 30 year conventional loans. In the last year, mortgage rates have moved in a narrow range as home prices have risen; it will take much more from the Fed to slow home price gains.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell in October as a persistent shortage of properties limited choice for potential buyers and pushed up prices, suggesting some softening in the pace of the housing market recovery after strong gains early this year.
Still, housing remains on solid footing, with sales for the full year on track to be the best in eight years. That should see housing take up some of the slack from a chronically weak manufacturing sector.
""The housing market is in decent shape but could be a lot better if people decided they were ready to move and listed their homes,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The National Association of Realtors said on Mondayexisting home sales declined 3.4 percent to an annual rate of5.36 million units. September's sales pace was unrevised at 5.55 million units and was the second highest since 2007.
The drop in sales was expected after contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell for two straight months. But with a tightening labor market, marked by a 5.0 percent unemployment rate, housing fundamentals are fairly healthy. 
In addition, the government has taken steps to ease lending standards for young adults. However, an anticipated interest rate hike next month by the Federal Reserve could make housing a bit expensive, especially if there is no significant pick-up in wage growth.
""There is every reason to expect that the demand for homes will grind higher in the coming months. While interest rates are set to rise, so are incomes, and that will keep housing affordability historically favorable,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The weak sales come on the heels of reports last week showing a drop in housing starts in October and a dip in confidence among home builders. Economists had forecast sales falling to a rate of 5.40 million units last month. 
The dollar rose to an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt were up marginally. The housing index rose 0.32 percent as the shortage of houses for sale was seen boosting homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN).
A separate report showed Markit's Purchasing Managers Index hit a 25-month low in early November, highlighting continued weakness in the factory sector. The decline, however, brought the PMI in line with the Institute for Supply Management survey, which has a longer history of tracking the manufacturing sector.
PAIN IN THE WEST
October home sales were up 3.9 percent from a year ago and held above their average for the year. Sales dropped 8.7 percent in the West from the prior month and fell 3.2 percent in the South. These two regions, which are experiencing strong population growth, have seen large price increases due to tight inventory.
The supply squeeze is mostly hurting the lower end of the market, where sales have dropped sharply from a year ago.
Last month, the number of unsold homes on the market fell 2.3 percent from September to 2.14 million units. Supply was down 4.5 percent from a year ago, a worrying sign as housing heads into a quiet season, the NAR said.
At October's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.7 months in September. A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
With inventories tight, the median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $219,600. October's price increase marked the 44th straight month of year-on-year gains.
Although higher prices could sideline potential buyers, especially those wanting to purchase a home for the first time, they are boosting equity for homeowners, which could encourage them to put their homes on the market. 
Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories. Last month, the share of first-time buyers crept up from September to almost a third. But the share was still the second lowest since 1981 on an annual basis.

""First-time home buyers continue to be crowded out by competition from investor sales. Price pressures from low inventory present another headwind to first-time buyers,"" said Derek Lindsey, an economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York.

1013,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 23, 2015 07:01AM ET</span>",'Uncertain' Impact Of Paris Attacks Hurts French Businesses,"By Avaneesh Pandey -

Initial signs that the deadly Paris attacks have caused economic damage in the country emerged Monday, with the release of the financial information company Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for France. While data for the 19-nation eurozone showed a faster-than-expected growth in the region’s private sector -- which reached its highest level in four-and-a-half years -- growth across France’s private sector hit its lowest level in three months.
Markit’s Flash France Composite Output Index , which measures the overall activity in the manufacturing and services sector, dropped to a three-month low of 51.3 in November, from 52.6 in the previous month. Any reading over 50 indicates growth.
“Both manufacturers and service providers signaled weaker increases in activity during November. In each case, growth was modest and the slowest in three months. Some service providers reported that the terrorist attacks in Paris had negatively impacted on activity,” Markit said, in a statement released Monday.
Business expectations in the French service sector also remain subdued. According to Markit, “while some firms cited the securing of major contracts and launch of new services as factors likely to support activity growth over the next 12 months, others pointed to a drop in confidence following the Paris attacks.”
""Longer-term economic impact following the attacks remains uncertain,"" Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, added.
The survey was conducted from Nov. 12 to Nov. 20, with most of the responses received after the attacks on Nov. 13, which killed 130 people.
The slowdown in eurozone’s second largest member contrasted sharply with the economic indicators of the eurozone as a whole, which recorded its strongest expansion since May 2011.
The Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index rose to 54.4 in November, from 53.9 in October, suggesting that the eurozone economy has gathered fresh momentum after its third-quarter slowdown. However, heightened insecurity following the Paris attacks, as well as tighter border controls that are now being mulled across Europe, could still slow trade in the region in the coming months.
“With recent comments from ECB [European Central Bank] chief Mario Draghi highlighting how the central bank remains disappointed with the strength of the upturn at this stage of the recovery, November’s slightly improved PMI reading will no doubt do little to dissuade policymakers that more needs to be done at their December meeting to ensure stronger and more sustainable growth,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said, in a statement.
Last week, the ECB chief declared that “we will do what we must” to aid recovery in the region and boost inflation, which, despite a massive stimulus program, has stubbornly persisted at levels way below the 2 percent target. Investors and analysts are now all but certain that the ECB will, during its December meeting, announce an expansion or extension of the 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) quantitative easing plan."

The strongest growth was seen in the euro zone periphery, rather than its two largest economies.

Meanwhile, the flash services purchasing managers’ index improved to 54.6 this month from 54.1 in October, a 54-month high and above expectations for a reading of 54.1.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The recovery continued to be led by the service sector, where business activity and new business rose at the fastest rates since May 2011 and employment showed the biggest monthly gain for five years.
Moreover, the survey’s employment, new orders and backlogs of work indicators all signaled the strongest monthly expansions in four-and-a-half years.
One area of weakness was France, where business activity rose at the slowest rate for three months, largely reflecting weaker service sector growth.
Growth meanwhile accelerated to a three-month high in Germany, fueled by the biggest monthly improvement in new business for two years.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, “The data are signaling GDP growth of 0.4% in the closing quarter of the year, with 0.5% in sight if we get even just a modest uptick in December.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell last week while a gauge of U.S. economic activity rebounded in October, signs of a healthy labor market and economy that could give the Federal Reserve confidence to raise interest rates next month.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region picked up slightly in November after two straight months of declines, another indication that the worst of the manufacturing rout was probably over. 
Outside manufacturing, the economy has remained resilient despite faltering global growth. 
""Business rolls on unperturbed by the China slowdown, sclerotic European growth or the commodity bust weighing on many emerging market nations, so it is time for the Fed to up the anchor on these very low interest rates,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Nov. 14, the Labor Department said. Claims have now held below the 300,000 mark for 37 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and are not too far from levels last seen in the early 1970s. 
Claims below this level are usually associated with a healthy jobs market. Economists say there is little scope for claims to drop further as the labor market approaches full employment. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 270,750 last week.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls portion of the November employment report. The four- week average of claims rose 7,500 between the October and November surveys, suggesting a pullback in job growth from October's robust 271,000 gain.
""We view U.S. labor market strength as very much intact and expect another month of solid job gains to pave the way for the Fed to raise rates in December,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York.
Minutes of the Fed policy-setting committee's Oct. 27-28 meeting published on Wednesday showed officials rallied behind a possible December increase in the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate.
U.S. stocks were slightly weaker, while Treasury prices rose. The dollar declined against a basket of currencies after four days of gains. 
TIGHTENING JOBS MARKET 
At 5 percent, the unemployment rate is in territory that many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment and the share of job seekers per open position is the lowest since 2007. Diminishing labor market slack is also highlighted by the shrinking ranks of the long-term unemployed. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 2,000 to 2.18 million in the week ended Nov. 7. 
The fairly robust labor market underscores the economy's stamina in the face a strong dollar, energy spending cuts, an inventory overhang and slowing global growth, which have undercut factory activity. 
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index increased 0.6 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in both September and August. That suggests economic growth will accelerate from the third-quarter's anemic 1.5 percent annualized pace. 
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its general activity index rose to 1.9 this month from -4.5 in October. It was the first positive reading in three months for the regional survey. The report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a healthy increase in U.S. manufacturing output in October.
""The big contraction in manufacturing activity is probably done for now,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.
Measures for new orders and shipments in the Philadelphia Fed survey increased seven points and four points, respectively.

The Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy unchanged Thursday even as the country’s exports -- hit by a weakening demand in China -- fell for the first time in over a year. The soft trade figures, coupled with Monday’s economic data that showed that the world’s third-largest economy is now in recession, are likely to build pressure on the central bank to further loosen its purse strings.
As widely expected, the central bank maintained its pledge to increase the purchase of Japanese government bonds at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen ($650 billion).
In a statement outlining its decision, the BoJ said that despite exports and production being hit by a slowdown in emerging economies, “Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately” -- reiterating its earlier assessment.
“Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy,” the BoJ said, in the statement.
Data released earlier this week showed that Japan's GDP shrank for the second consecutive quarter in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, marking the fourth time the country has entered recession since the global financial crisis. The data also cast doubts over the efficacy of the ambitious stimulus package championed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the government’s 2 percent inflation target.
“The BoJ places a lot of importance on inflation expectations, so they would have to consider more easing if inflation expectations weaken further,” Norio Miyagawa, a senior economist at Mizuho Securities, told Reuters. “If it's just oil prices remaining weak, the BoJ can afford to wait. But if oil price moves start to bring down inflation expectations, the BoJ would have to move.”
Earlier Thursday, data released by the Japanese ministry of finance showed that exports slid 2.1 percent from a year earlier to 6.544 trillion yen ($52.9 billion) in October -- the first decline since August 2014. Japanese manufacturers were mainly hit by slowdown in China, and, as the data showed, exports to the world’s second-largest economy fell 3.6 percent year-on-year in October, marking the third straight month of decline.
However, over the previous month, overall exports rose 0.6 percent in October -- the first increase in four months.
“The data probably came as neutral to the BoJ's outlook,” Hidenobu Tokuda, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, told Reuters. “Exports show signs of bottoming out, but given declining export volume, they are unlikely to become a driver of growth in the current quarter as effects of China’s slowdown and falling commodity prices are spreading to other countries.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts in October fell to a seven-month low, weighed down by a steep decline in the construction of multi-family homes, but a surge in building permits suggested the housing market remained on solid ground.
While the drop in groundbreaking activity reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday implied a moderation in residential investment early in the fourth quarter, it did little to change the view that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates next month.
""Overall, fundamentals for the sector remain solid. Household formation is rising, demand for new homes is outstripping supply, and home builder confidence remains near its highest level in a decade,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (L:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Groundbreaking dropped 11 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.06 million units last month, the lowest level since March, the Commerce Department said. October marked the seventh straight month that starts remained above 1 million units, the longest stretch since 2007. Building permits increased 4.1 percent to a 1.15 million-unit rate. 
Rapidly rising household formation, mostly driven by young adults leaving their parental homes and a strengthening labor market, is supporting the housing sector. 
Highlighting the housing market's underlying strength, a second report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase homes jumped 6.2 percent during the week ended Nov. 13 from a week earlier.
In the wake of the soft October housing numbers,  Barclays  (L:BARC) trimmed its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.2 percent annual rate. 
Housing has contributed to GDP growth in each of the last six quarters, adding 0.2 percentage point to the third-quarter's 1.5 percent growth pace.
""Homebuilding may not keep the Fed from 'liftoff' but it will be their biggest concern. When Fed officials say they want to see more investment spending this recovery, they really mean residential housing construction,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Minutes of the Fed policy-setting committee's Oct. 27-28 meeting showed officials rallied behind a possible December increase in the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate.
U.S. stock markets were trading higher, with the S&P homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> rising 2.15 percent. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, gained 1.69 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, advanced 2.22 percent. 
The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt pared their losses.
LAND, LABOR SHORTAGES 
Economists had forecast housing starts dropping to only a 1.16 million-unit pace last month. Many viewed the weakness in October as being related to land and labor shortages, constraints that have been flagged by home builders.
""Structural issues including a shortfall in immigrant labor are inhibiting construction. The supply shortage in the single-family market is not likely to be alleviated any time soon,"" said David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
Groundbreaking on single-family home projects, the largest segment of the housing market, fell 2.4 percent to a 722,000-unit pace in October. Single-family starts were pulled down by a 6.9 percent plunge in groundbreaking activity in the South, where most home building takes place. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment plunged 25.1 percent to a 338,000-unit pace. 
Single-family building permits rose 2.4 percent last month to their highest level since December 2007. Single-family permits in the South also hit their highest level since December 2007. Multi-family building permits increased 6.8 percent.

""The October permit requests were above the starts number, and for the past three months permits have been running a little ahead of the building pace, so don't be surprised if housing activity rebounds solidly in November,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices in China rose for first time in over a year in October on an annual basis, signalling a housing market stabilisation that could help re-energise the listless economy.
A swift rebound in property prices, however, is unlikely due to high inventories in all but the biggest cities, forcing developers to slow the pace of or even stop expansion to protect their cash flows.
""For next year, most market players are somewhat pessimistic as new construction is still dropping and policy effects are fading away,"" said Liu Yuan, head of research at property consultant Centaline in Shanghai.
Average new home prices rose 0.1 percent in October from a year earlier, Reuters calculated from National Statistics Bureau(NBS) data out on Wednesday, reversing September's 0.9 percent drop, marking the first year-on-year gains since August 2014.
Even a modest recovery in a sector that accounts for 15 percent of gross domestic product is a welcome boost for an economy heading for its weakest growth in 25 years.
The numbers bootsted Chinese real estate stocks with the Shanghai stock exchange property subindex surging more than 4 percent. Greenland Holdings and Poly Real Estate gained nearly 10 percent.
The NBS data showed larger cities have led the price upturn, with Shenzhen the top performer. Prices in Shenzhen rose 39.9 percent in October from a year earlier, quickening from September's annual 37.6 percent.
""Looking ahead, property prices will continue to warm up in first and second-tier cities. Smaller cities will face headwinds due to inventory destocking,"" economists at ANZ said.
MORE SUPPORT MOVES?
Following a year-long slump, China's home sales and prices have increased in bigger cities over recent months, helped by a barrage of government measures. Analysts expected to see more measures to revive the key sector in coming months.
Chinese President Xi Jinping told the APEC conference in Manila on Wedneday that the fundamentals of China's economy remain positive, the economy is proving resilient to the pains of deepening reform, and there is ample room to fend off downward pressure.
Data out last week showed growth in property investment cooled to its slowest rate since the global financial crisis, while new construction continued to show year-on-year falls.
""There are signs of price gains losing momentum, fuelling hopes that more stimulus, including tax breaks and downpayment cuts, will come in the remainder of this year,"" said Guo Yi, market director of Yahao, a real estate consulting agency.
Demonstrating that loss of momentum, month-on-month price gains were recorded in only 27 of the 70 cities tracked by the NBS, down from 39 in September.

Compared to a month earlier, home prices in October rose 0.2 percent, dipping from September's gains of 0.3 percent, according to Reuters calculations based on NBS data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased in October after two straight months of declines as the cost of healthcare and other services rose, evidence of firming inflation that further supports views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
The economic outlook also got a boost from other data on Tuesday showing a fairly solid increase in manufacturing output in October after dropping for two consecutive months.
""There is nothing that derails a December Fed rate hike in today's data. Inflation is starting to turn a corner and manufacturing production remains resilient,"" said Thomas Costerg, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Bank in New York.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month, reversing September's 0.2 percent drop. In the 12 months through October, the CPI advanced 0.2 percent after being unchanged in September.
Signs of stabilization in prices after a recent downward spiral are likely to be welcomed by Fed officials and give them some confidence that inflation will gradually move toward the central bank's 2.0 percent target.
Inflation has persistently run below target. In the wake of a robust October employment report, the U.S. central bank is expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero at its Dec. 15-16 meeting. 
There is hope tightening labor market conditions, characterized by a jobless rate now in a range that some Fed officials view as consistent with full employment, will put upward pressure on wages and drive inflation toward its target.
A report from the Fed showed manufacturing production increased 0.4 percent as the output of both long-lasting and nondurable goods rose. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, declined in both August and September. The sector has been hobbled by a strong dollar, spending cuts by energy firms and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bloat.
However, further declines in mining output and a weather-related drop in utilities production weighed on overall industrial production last month. 
Still, the increase in manufacturing output was another indication that economic growth would accelerate in the fourth quarter after braking to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter.
ABATING HEADWINDS
""The healthy rise in manufacturing sector production is a welcome sign that the headwinds to this sector are beginning to ease,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""The outlook for the industrial sector is becoming incrementally more favorable.""
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. interest rate futures implied a 70 percent chance of a December rate hike, up from 68 percent on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch. Stocks on Wall Street rose, boosted by better-than-expected earnings from Wal-Mart (N:WMT) and  Home Depot  (N:HD).
In October, the so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, gained 0.2 percent after a similar rise the prior month. Rents and medical costs accounted for much of the increase in the core CPI last month.
The rental index increased 0.3 percent after rising 0.4 percent in September. Medical care costs rose 0.7 percent, the largest increase since April.
In the 12 months through October, the core CPI increased 1.9 percent after rising by the same margin in September.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, which is running below the core CPI. The dollar's 18 percent rise against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, has made imports such as apparel and automobiles less expensive.
Inflation should get a boost next year as the weak readings from late 2014 and this year drop out of the calculation. 
Energy prices, including gasoline and electricity, rose last month. While food prices rose marginally, four of the six major grocery store food group indexes increased, with cereals and bakery products posting the largest increase since August 2011. 

Hospital costs increased 2.0 percent in October and airline fares rose 1.5 percent, ending a string of three consecutive declines. There were also increases in recreation costs, but apparel prices recorded their biggest decline since December. Prices for used cars and trucks fell for a sixth straight month.

International Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the global economy with the observation that the recoveries in the United States and euro area economies had continued, although growth in Asia had slowed by more than had earlier been expected. This slowing was likely to be more persistent than expected and, as a result, growth in Australia's trading partners was expected to be slightly below its decade average over the period ahead. The outlook for the Asian region, particularly China, remained one of the key uncertainties in forecasting global growth. Core inflation had generally been steady in both the advanced and emerging economies at rates below central banks' targets, while monetary conditions globally were likely to be more accommodative than previously expected.
The slowdown in growth in Asia had been associated with lower growth in global trade volumes and industrial production, as well as further modest falls in commodity prices. Nevertheless, members noted that the outlook for Australia's terms of trade was little changed. One upside risk for commodity prices was the possibility of high-cost producers, particularly in China, cutting production in response to the already lower commodity prices. A downside risk stemmed from the possibility of weaker growth in global demand.
Members noted that growth in the services sector in China had held up over the year to the September quarter, but that growth in the industrial sector had declined partly owing to ongoing weakness in residential construction. Although residential property prices had increased a little in recent months, sales had retraced some of the increase seen earlier in the year. Furthermore, a substantial inventory of unsold residential property in many smaller cities suggested that it could be some time before there was a pick-up in construction activity. Members noted that the ongoing process of urbanisation would help to support demand for residential property in the longer term, notwithstanding projections of a gradual decline in the Chinese working-age population. Meanwhile, growth in exports of Chinese steel had supported domestic crude steel production despite subdued domestic steel demand. In response to moderating economic growth and disinflationary pressures apparent in producer price indices and the GDP deflator, the People's Bank of China (PBC) had eased monetary policy further.
Turning to other parts of Asia, the economic recovery in Japan appeared to have lost momentum around the middle of the year, although the labour market had remained tight and nominal wages had been growing moderately. To some extent, the tightness of the labour market reflected a fall in the supply of available workers associated with an ageing population. Members noted that other high-income economies in the region, including Korea, would face similar demographic challenges. Although core inflation in Japan had increased over the past couple of years, members observed that the Bank of Japan expected inflation to reach its 2 per cent target around six months later than had previously been anticipated. In the rest of east Asia, softening external demand had led to slower growth over the past year and there were signs that domestic demand had also eased in most economies in the region. India was a notable exception, where growth in domestic demand had remained strong and had been supported by a further easing in monetary policy.
Members noted that growth in domestic demand in the United States had been sustained, although recorded GDP growth had moderated in the September quarter following strong growth in the preceding quarter. Members observed that consumption growth had remained robust, supported by further improvement in labour market conditions. Wage growth had picked up in the September quarter, following a relatively weak outcome in June, to be around rates of recent years in year-ended terms. Members noted that the core inflation rate was steady, but below the Federal Reserve's target.
Recent data suggested that the euro area economy had been growing above trend and the unemployment rate continued to fall modestly, although members acknowledged that there had been considerable diversity in outcomes across countries. Core inflation for the euro area had increased over 2015, but remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members observed that the Australian economy continued to grow in the September quarter as economic activity continued to shift away from mining investment to other sectors of the economy. Members noted that the forecasts for GDP growth were not materially different from those presented three months earlier. Growth was expected to be between 2–3 per cent over the year to June 2016, before rising to 2¾–3¾ per cent over the year to June 2017. The forecast for GDP growth towards the end of the forecast period had been revised down slightly to incorporate information about minor delays to the commencement of production at some large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
Members noted that recent data had indicated that consumption growth was likely to have continued at a moderate pace in the September quarter. Growth in retail sales values had been little changed in year-ended terms, survey measures of households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained above average and motor vehicle sales had risen strongly. Household consumption was forecast to contribute significantly to expenditure growth over the next couple of years, supported by low interest rates and relatively strong employment growth. The household saving ratio was still expected to decline gradually over the forecast period, as income growth was expected to pick up only slowly from recent low rates. Members noted that households' decisions about consumption and saving continued to represent an important source of uncertainty for the forecasts.
Overall, the low level of interest rates continued to support the housing market. Forward-looking indicators of housing activity generally pointed to further growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a moderating rate. Auction clearance rates and housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had declined over recent months. Lending standards by banks had been tightened in response to changes in supervisory measures announced by the Australian  Prudential  (L:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and a number of lenders had announced increases in mortgage rates for both investors and owner-occupiers. Notwithstanding questions over the accuracy of the components of housing credit data, overall housing credit growth had increased a little over recent months, with growth in lending to investors in housing easing slightly and that for owner-occupiers apparently picking up.
Recent data indicated that survey measures of business conditions in the non-mining sector had remained clearly above their long-run average levels, particularly for services. Support provided to the economy following the depreciation of the exchange rate was particularly apparent in the sizeable contribution to growth from net service exports over the year to date. Growth in net service exports was expected to continue to boost growth in output over the forecast period. These developments had been accompanied by significant growth in employment in the services sector but, given that parts of that sector tend to be less capital-intensive, there had been little effect on investment from the strength of business conditions. The stock of non-residential building work yet to be done had fallen further in the June quarter but was still around its decade-average as a share of GDP, and approvals for new work remained low. Business credit growth had picked up in September after easing over most of 2015. Members noted that the ongoing improvement in domestic demand, together with the increased competitiveness from the lower exchange rate, were expected to lead to a pick-up in non-mining business investment in the second half of the forecast period. However, there remained considerable uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of this recovery.
Mining investment was expected to continue to decline over the forecast period, with the decline expected largely to have run its course by the end of 2017. Mining investment was expected to make the largest subtraction from demand of around 1½ percentage points in 2015/16, although the effect on GDP would be somewhat less than this after accounting for the large share of imports used in mining investment. Resource exports looked to have rebounded in the September quarter, following earlier disruptions from adverse weather and some unanticipated shutdowns of LNG facilities. LNG exports were expected to ramp up over the remainder of the forecast period, albeit with some minor delays relative to expectations in August.
Employment growth had been stronger than expected over 2015 and this had been accompanied by a noticeable increase in the participation rate. Employment growth had been concentrated in the household and business services sectors. Measures of job vacancies and advertisements pointed to continued growth in employment in the months ahead. The unemployment rate, after being steady at around 6–6¼ per cent for more than a year, was expected to remain around this elevated level for some time before declining gradually. Members observed that the relatively high unemployment rate and low growth of wages pointed to a degree of spare capacity in the economy.
The CPI data for the September quarter indicated that underlying inflation had declined to a bit above ¼ per cent in the quarter and to 2–2¼ per cent in year-ended terms. The CPI had increased by 0.1 per cent in the quarter (in seasonally adjusted terms) and by 1.5 per cent over the year. The low year-ended outcome in part reflected the earlier decline in fuel prices and a decline in utility prices in the September quarter.
While quarterly inflation remained subject to a degree of volatility and measurement error, the broad-based nature of the low outcome in the September quarter suggested that inflationary pressures were a bit more subdued than expected. The profile for underlying inflation had been revised down consequently. Underlying inflation was now expected to be close to 2 per cent in year-ended terms over the course of most of the next year, before picking up to around 2½ per cent in the second half of the forecast period.
Non-tradables inflation had declined in the September quarter, suggesting that domestic inflationary pressures were well contained and consistent with low growth in labour costs and moderate demand growth. Falls in regulated utility prices in some states had also contributed. Inflation in new dwelling costs had eased in the quarter, but had increased over the past couple of years, particularly in Sydney, in line with the continued high level of residential construction activity.
The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed both in the September quarter and over the past year. Members noted data showing that the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate had led to higher Australian dollar prices for imports, but that the effect of this on final consumer prices had been tempered by heightened competitive pressures, consistent with information received from liaison. Nevertheless, gradual pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation was still expected to place some upward pressure on the prices of tradable items over the next several years.
Financial Markets
Members opened their discussion of financial markets by observing that the key influence over the past month had been changing expectations about the policy settings of the major central banks. Global markets continued to be affected by large capital flows as foreign exchange reserves declined and some oil-producing sovereign wealth funds adjusted their portfolios.
In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left monetary policy unchanged at its October policy meeting, but indicated that an increase in the federal funds rate would be seriously considered at its December meeting, resulting in markets assigning a 50–50 chance of a rate rise occurring at that time. The ECB left policy unchanged at its October meeting, but signalled that it would be likely to announce further stimulus measures at its December meeting. The PBC further reduced its benchmark lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points, having already reduced benchmark rates by more than 125 basis points since November 2014. The PBC also reduced reserve requirement ratios by another 50 basis points, although much of the effect of this measure was to offset the drain on liquidity from recent sales of foreign currency reserves. There were also raised expectations that the Bank of Japan would ease monetary policy further in the near term.
Yields on US Treasuries were a little higher in net terms over October. Movements at the shorter end of government yield curves were more pronounced, including in Germany, where yields on two-year Bunds fell to a new historic low following the ECB's signal about possibly announcing new policy measures at its next meeting. Yields on longer-term Australian Government Securities had moved broadly in line with US yields.
The US dollar was little changed over October, with intra-month movements mainly reflecting changing expectations for monetary policy in the major jurisdictions. The depreciation of the US dollar against the euro earlier in the month had been retraced following the ECB's policy meeting and the US dollar had appreciated further against the euro following the FOMC's most recent meeting. The renminbi was unchanged against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month. The Australian dollar had also been little changed against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month.
The corporate bond market in the United States had seen strong issuance over much of 2015 to date, with borrowing rates at historic lows until recently, when spreads had widened. Spreads on Australian corporate bonds had also widened, particularly for resource-related companies, although borrowing costs remained relatively low for these companies overall. Australian companies generally remained conservatively geared.
Global equity prices had increased sharply over the past month, including following the changes in expected and actual monetary policy by the major central banks, and recovered most of their earlier falls. Australian equity prices rose but by less than the major markets, and resources sector share prices fully retraced much of their sharp falls recorded in late September.
The major banks in Australia continued to raise equity to meet the changes to minimum capital requirements announced by APRA around mid year, which would take effect from July 2016. Equity as a source of funding for banks had increased by around ½ percentage point to 8 per cent of total funding. The largest banks had increased standard variable housing rates in October by 15–20 basis points. Members noted that widening margins on mortgage lending were in part offsetting lower margins on lending to larger businesses, for which lending rates had continued to decline in the face of strong competition. Deposit rates had been lowered and funding costs more generally had declined.
Over the course of 2015 to date, Australian financial institutions had made substantial revisions to the data used to categorise housing, business and personal credit. The revisions were particularly large for the split of housing credit between owner-occupation and investment, with the share of housing credit extended to investors revised from 35 to 40 per cent. More recently, as a result of the increase in lending rates to investors in housing, a significant amount of housing lending had been reclassified from investment to owner-occupation. Further switching was expected in coming months. The revisions had resulted in discrete breaks in the level of the two components of housing credit, complicating the assessment of the rate of growth in these two components. Members noted that the stock of total lending for housing as well as its growth rate were not materially affected by the revisions.
At the time of the meeting, pricing in financial markets reflected around a 50–50 expectation of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the global economy was expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in the Asian region, continuing growth in the United States and a recovery in Europe. The slowdown in Asia had been more persistent than earlier anticipated and had contributed to lower commodity prices, along with increased supply of commodities, including from Australia. The terms of trade for Australia had declined further. Monetary policy was accommodative in many economies and the low level of oil prices was expected to support growth in Australia's major trading partners over the next few years. Inflation rates remained low and below central banks' targets.
Members noted that recent data on economic activity in Australia suggested that the moderate economic expansion had continued. The very low level of interest rates was supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment. In addition, the Australian dollar was adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices and boosting demand for domestic production. This had been most evident in the services sector, which had experienced strong employment growth over the past year. While measures of non-mining investment intentions had remained subdued, surveys of business conditions had strengthened to above-average levels. These factors suggested that the prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months.
Overall, the forecast for the Australian economy remained for growth to strengthen gradually over the next two years as the drag on GDP growth from falling mining investment waned and activity progressively shifted to non-mining sectors of the economy. However, members recognised that there was still evidence of spare capacity, including the relatively high unemployment rate, low wage growth and the lower-than-expected inflation outcome in the September quarter. The gradual nature of the pick-up in domestic growth suggested that spare capacity would persist for some time. Inflation was forecast to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years, but somewhat lower than earlier expected.
In these circumstances, members judged that monetary policy needed to be accommodative. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing would reduce the support to demand from low interest rates slightly, overall conditions were still accommodative. Credit growth had increased a little over recent months and housing prices had risen further in Melbourne and Sydney, though the pace of growth had moderated and housing prices were steady in other cities. Members noted that supervisory measures were helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market.
Taking the above information into consideration, members decided that leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting was appropriate. They judged that the inflation outlook may afford some scope for further easing of monetary policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. The Board would continue to assess the outlook, and whether the current stance of policy would most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2015 07:41AM ET</span>","Japan relapses into recession in July-September, a blow to 'Abenomics'","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan slipped into its fourth technical recession in five years between July and September - spotlighting how the government's ""Abenomics"" policies have struggled to drag the economy out of chronic stagnation. 
Official data on Monday showed the world's third-largest economy shrank an annual 0.8 percent in July-September after a 0.7 percent contraction in the prior quarter, putting it firmly into recession - two consecutive quarters of declines. 
Monday's data highlights the need, analysts say, for structural reform aimed at breaking through supply-side constraints including labor shortages in a fast-ageing society, which suffered from chronic deflation for more than 15 years.
""Abenomics' first two arrows of monetary and fiscal stimulus were meant to buy time, but Japan failed to make progress with painful reforms needed to boost its growth potential,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""Without reform (the 'third arrow'), the economy's growth potential remains low, making it vulnerable to shocks and to suffering recessions more often.""
Economics Minister Akira Amari, at a news conference after the data was published, noted a shortage of labor available for public works projects to stimulate the economy, highlighting a major constraint policymakers face - not enough suitable workers to build growth.
Amari nodded when asked if he saw ""no need"" to craft an extra budget to stimulate demand right away, despite U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew proposing earlier that Japan should provide more fiscal support to ensure it returns to growth - led by domestic demand.
Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and boost capital spending to generate a virtuous circle of growth led by the private sector, instead of simply demanding yet more stimulus when such growth remained elusive.
But Amari was targeting a corporate sector that has shown little enthusiasm for Japan's economic prospects of late.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers last week fell in November from October, posting the lowest reading since April 2013. The service sector index fell in October to its lowest since March, dragged down by wholesalers and retailers. [L3N13564D] 
SOME BRIGHTER SIGNS
Even though Monday's numbers were gloomy, the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite some weaknesses, the economy continued to recover moderately on improvements in job and income conditions.
""While there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various (stimulus) steps taken so far,"" Amari said in an earlier statement. 
Amari said a big reduction in inventories was the major culprit in the third-quarter contraction. Excluding this effect, he said, final demand contributed an annualized 1.4 percent point to growth. 
But capital expenditure fell 1.3 percent, more than a median market forecast of a 0.4 percent decrease, to mark a second declining quarter, and revealing the sluggish state of manufacturing investment.
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of gross domestic product, rose 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, in line with the median market forecast.
While domestic demand shaved 0.3 percentage point off GDP growth, foreign demand for Japan's exports added 0.1 point, the data showed.
The weak data would have come as little surprise to Bank of Japan officials, who had also largely factored in the recession, and now expect growth to recover in coming quarters as consumption and factory output show signs of a pick-up, however modest. 

The data will be closely scrutinized by the Bank of Japan, but board members are widely expected to keep monetary policy steady at the central bank's rate review this week, analysts said.

Japan is back in recession. According to government data released Monday, the GDP of the world’s third-largest economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter in the three-month period ending September 30, marking a technical recession.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter, while on an annualized basis, the GDP shrank 0.8 percent. The higher-than-expected contraction follows the second quarter’s less-than-expected yearly decline of 1.2 percent.
Capital expenditure also fell 1.3 percent in the July-September period -- more than the forecast of a 0.4 percent decline.
The latest data, which marks the fourth time Japan has entered recession since the global financial crisis, is likely to put further pressure on the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to expand an ambitious stimulus package championed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
In 2013, BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced a massive $1.4 trillion quantitative easing program in a bid to restore the economy to health and end years of deflation. At the time, Kuroda described the move as “monetary easing in an entirely new dimension.” However, despite the move, deflation and growth fears have continued to plague Japan.
“We … remain convinced that more stimulus will eventually be needed, and now believe that the January meeting is the most likely venue for its announcement,” Marcel Thieliant, an economist at research firm Capital Economics, reportedly said, adding that Japanese policymakers had shown “considerable reluctance” to do so.
In a statement released last month, the central bank slashed the country’s growth outlook and pushed back the deadline to achieve its target of 2 percent inflation. The BoJ now projects GDP to grow at 1.2 percent this fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of 1.7 percent.
“We expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of various steps taken so far,” Japanese Economics Minister Akira Amari reportedly said Monday.
The markets, however, seemed less optimistic. Following the release of the GDP figures, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.1 percent in early trade, before recovering slightly and trading down 0.9 percent."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in October amid a surprise decline in automobile purchases, suggesting a slowdown in consumer spending that could temper expectations of a strong pickup in fourth-quarter economic growth.
Other data on Friday showed a second straight monthly decline in producer prices as the cost of services fell. Still, the soft inflation and signs of slowing consumer spending are unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month, economists said.
""The weak reports will provide some cause for caution at the Fed, and while they are unlikely to change the prevailing bias for a December 'liftoff,' they could add to the case for a shallower tightening path thereafter,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York
The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in both September and August. Economists had forecast sales increasing 0.3 percent.
Sales at auto dealerships fell 0.5 percent last month after rising 1.4 percent in September. The decline was surprising given that automakers reported strong sales for October. Economists said heavy discounting to attract buyers was likely to blame for the discrepancy. 
A 0.9 percent drop in the value of sales at service stations, which reflected lower gasoline prices, also helped to restrain retail sales last month.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
The lackluster report suggests that savings from cheaper gasoline are being used to pay rents, which have increased substantially over the past year. 
 Barclays  (L:BARC) trimmed its fourth-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.4 percent annual rate. The weak October retail sales also could raise concerns about the upcoming holiday shopping season. 
Economists, however, are optimistic of sturdy consumer spending in the final months of the year, as a pickup in job growth and low inflation boost disposable income.
CONSUMERS UPBEAT
That view was supported by a separate report showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 93.1 in early November from a reading of 90.0 in October. 
The survey showed an improvement in buying plans for large discretionary purchases, especially vehicles. Lower-income households also were upbeat about their prospects in November. 
""The rise in confidence to the level last seen in July might ease a few concerns at the Fed about slowing growth in recent months,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
A third report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index fell 0.4 percent last month after dropping 0.5 percent in September. 
In the 12 months through October, the PPI fell 1.6 percent, the largest decline since the revamped series started in 2009 and following on the heels of a 1.1 percent drop in September. October also marked the ninth straight 12-month decrease in the index.
The weak spending and inflation data did not significantly shift expectations the Fed will raise rates next month in the wake of October's robust employment report. 
U.S. rates futures implied that traders saw a 66 percent chance of a rate hike in December, compared to 70 percent on Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The U.S. central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero since December 2008.
The Standard & Poor's retail index <.SPXRT> fell 2.28 percent, underperforming an overall weak U.S. stock market. Retailer Macys' (N:M) dropped 2.5 percent and department store operator Kohls (N:KSS) declined 6.5 percent.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
Economic growth braked to a 1.5 percent rate in the third quarter as businesses worked through an inventory glut and energy companies continued to cut back spending in response to lower oil prices. 
But a fourth report from the Commerce Department suggested the drag on third-quarter growth from inventories was probably not as large as initially thought. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the GDP calculation, increased 0.5 percent in September after a similar rise in August.
With a report earlier this week showing a solid rise in wholesale inventories in September, JPMorgan (N:JPM) said it expected third-quarter GDP would be raised to a 2.3 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month.

That, however, means inventories would again weigh on growth in the fourth quarter.

Growth in the eurozone slowed to 0.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter when it grew by 0.4 percent. Germany, the region's largest economy, also slowed down to grow by 0.3 percent as falling exports weighed on economic growth.
Germany's growth figure matched market expectations but was slower than the 0.4 percent expansion in the previous quarter, while the GDP for the 19-nation eurozone was below market expectations of 0.4 percent. Growth in the 28-nation European Union held steady at 0.4 percent, according to official data.
In Germany, where the economy is driven by exports, higher spending by households and the government helped offset declines in foreign trade, the country's official statistics agency said.
""According to preliminary estimates, growth was held back by foreign trade because imports rose far more strongly than exports,"" the agency added. Germany expanded 1.7 percent from a year earlier if adjusted seasonally.
France’s GDP also grew 0.3 percent last quarter, a separate data released earlier showed. GDP figures for the largest eurozone economies have lagged due to weak trade performance. Data showed Italy and Netherlands also reported marginal expansions Friday, while Portugal was flat and Finland reported a small decline in its economy.
The third quarter was also marred by Greece’s near-exit from the the bloc, denting investor confidence in the region. The bloc's waning growth may reportedly encourage the European Central Bank to hold off on a hike in interest rates even as investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates for the first time in nine years at its December meeting."

On Friday, the U.S. Census Bureau is scheduled to release the retail sales data for the month of October. Most analysts expect a slight increase in the retail sales over the previous month, which, if true, would indicate an uptick in consumer spending and provide further impetus to calls for a rate hike before year end.
According to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, October retail sales are expected to accelerate 0.3 percent over the previous month, when they rose by just 0.1 percent. Retail sales, excluding automobiles, are expected to rise 0.4 percent.
Meanwhile, analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) struck a contrarian note and said that they expected a 0.3 percent month-on-month decline in October retail sales, caused primarily by warmer-than-expected winters.
“There has been a late start to the winter this year: the average temperature in October was 57.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the highest since 1963 and above the historical average of 54.3 degrees. Intuitively, this would depress sales of cold weather apparel, such as coats, hats, boots, etc,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch reportedly said, in a note to investors.
However, according to the Journal, a warm October is unlikely to significantly dent retail sales, as general-merchandise and clothing-store sales constitute only a small fraction of total retail sales.
All economic data to be released until December will be scrutinized by economists and investors looking for clues to a much-anticipated rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Positive trends in the U.S. labor markets over the recent weeks have seemingly trumped concerns aired by the more dovish analysts, who cite a prevailing low inflation as a reason to delay tightening monetary policy.
“It is quite possible that the conditions the Committee [the Federal Open Markets Committee] has established to begin to normalize monetary policy could soon be satisfied,” New York Fed President William Dudley said, during a speech Thursday.
Many now expect that even a weaker-than-expected retail sales data is unlikely to delay an imminent rate hike, as long as the number remains in the positive territory."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. applications for unemployment benefits last week held steady at levels consistent with a strengthening labor market and job openings rose in September, encouraging signs for the Federal Reserve as it contemplates raising interest rates next month.
Labor market resilience, despite faltering global growth, underscores the U.S. economy's strong fundamentals.
""The jobs market continues to do well. We are very close to hitting full employment and that suggests the Fed has the green light to start raising rates,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 276,000 for the week ended Nov. 7, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Despite having risen above their average for October, claims are not too far from levels last seen in the early 1970s.
They have now held below the 300,000 threshold for 36 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years. Claims below this level are usually associated with a healthy jobs market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 5,000 to 267,750 last week, still close to a 42-year low.
Labor market strength, marked by a surge in job growth in October and a jobless rate that is now in a range many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment, has bolstered expectations of a liftoff in the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate at the Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.
The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Last month, nonfarm payrolls recorded their largest gain since December 2014 and the unemployment rate fell to a 7-1/2-year low of 5.0 percent.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING 
In a second report, the Labor Department said job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 149,000 to 5.53 million in September. That was the third highest reading since the series started and lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent in August.
Hiring, however, dipped to 5.05 million in September from 5.08 million the prior month. The hiring rate slipped to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in August. 
The gap between job openings and hiring suggests employers are having trouble finding qualified workers.
""It is indicative of the skills mismatch that has basically been prevalent for the better part of last couple of years, and other metrics continue to indicate that as well,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. 
The report also showed continued tightening in the labor market, with a drop in the number of unemployed job seekers per open job to a low ratio of 1.4 in September. That was the lowest since 2007 and was down from 1.5 in August.
The JOLTS report also showed little change in layoffs and quits rates, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence.
""Declining labor market slack, steady worker confidence, and continued employment gains will likely bolster the Fed's confidence in the economic outlook and ultimately lead to an initial rate hike at the December meeting,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York.
Job openings were concentrated in trade, transportation and utilities, as well as education and food services. There were also increases in professional and business services, and government.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending November 7 was unchanged from a week earlier at a seasonally adjusted 276,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 6,000 to 270,000.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 35 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended October 31 rose to 2.174 million from 2.169 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.160 million.
The four-week moving average was 267,750, an increase of 5,000 from the previous week’s total of 262,750. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Britain’s unemployment rate between June to September fell to its lowest in seven years, the Office for National Statistics said, Wednesday. Employment also hit a record high during the quarter with 73.7 percent of the population working at least one job, ONS said.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent, below an analysts’ forecast of 5.4 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Employment surged by 177,000 people to 31.2 million.
However the report noted that wage growth had slowed over the year. Earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.5 percent for the quarter, down from 2.8 percent in the previous three months. Earnings rose by 3 percent in the quarter, helped by bonuses that rose 15 percent.
The slow rise in wage growth may prompt the Bank of England to continue the freeze on interest rates. Central bank Governor Mark Carney said that the ""[unemployment] rate will probably average 5.2 percent next year and 5 percent in 2017,"" according to reports.
Carney also told Sky News in an interview Wednesday that the decision on when to increase interest rates from a record low will ""get more difficult” as wages pick up.
Stronger-than-expected employment numbers in the U.S. have bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates -- its first such move in nine years -- in December.
“The slowdown in the pace of the UK's pay recovery may signal that the rebound enjoyed during much of 2015 has eased,” Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, told the Wiltshire Times. “Signs of a return to productivity growth should generate more upward pay pressure,” he added."

Chinese households shrugged off fears of a slowing economy as October retail sales in the country reportedly rose 11 percent -- its fastest expansion this year and a shade above expectations. The data released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics, China, said the expansion was helped by strong sales of mobile phones, building supplies and household products.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a growth in October retail sales to stay flat at September’s growth rate of 10.9 percent.
Once dubbed “the world's factory floor” China's services and retail businesses bucked the trend of tepid industrial data released Wednesday, further highlighting a shift in the country’s economy to a consumer-led model.

Consumption accounted for 60 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in the first half of 2015 -- up 5.7 percent from the first six months of 2014. In October, electronic goods, office supplies and furniture sales saw the most growth even as sales of petroleum & petroleum products declined by 7.1 percent.
Wednesday’s data reflected the two-speed nature of the economy as Beijing tries to encourage growth based on consumer spending instead of heavy industries, the Associated Press (AP) said.
""We expect further improvements in the data over the coming quarters which ought to quash any lingering concerns that China may be about to enter a deeper downturn,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report cited by AP.
However, industrial production in the world’s second-largest economy grew at a rate of 5.6 percent in October, slower than September’s growth of 5.7 percent while economists expected a 5.8 percent gain."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell in October as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods declined, indicating that a strong dollar and soft global demand continued to exert downward pressure on imported inflation. 
Other data on Tuesday showed a surprise increase in wholesale inventories in September, suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter was not as abrupt as initially believed. 
The Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.5 percent last month after declining 0.6 percent in September. 
Import prices have now fallen in 14 of the last 16 months. Imported petroleum prices fell 2.1 percent after slipping 6.0 percent in September. 
""We believe that weakness in emerging Asia, especially China, is likely to push down import prices over and above any effect from the appreciation of the dollar,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York. 
In the 12 months through October, prices tumbled 10.5 percent. The robust dollar and a sharp decline in oil prices have weighed on inflation, which is persistently running below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. 
Weak inflation pressures, however, are unlikely to deter the U.S. central bank from raising interest rates next month after job growth surged in October and the unemployment rate fell to a 7-1/2-year low of 5.0 percent. 
A tightening labor market could give Fed officials confidence that inflation will gradually move toward its target.
A Reuters survey of over 80 leading economists published on Tuesday showed a 70 percent median chance the Fed would raise its benchmark overnight interest rate at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.
""There is more pass-through to come and we may be looking at a longer lag between the peak in dollar appreciation and the trough in import price declines than has been typical,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The dollar has gained 16.6 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014. Its impact on inflation was underscored by a 0.4 percent drop in import prices excluding petroleum last month, the largest decrease since January. 
On Tuesday, the dollar rose to a fresh seven-month high against a basket of currencies as traders anticipated the first interest rate hike from the Fed in nearly a decade. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were little changed and stocks were trading lower.
LESS INVENTORY DRAG 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 0.5 percent as rises in automobiles, furniture, farm products and apparel offset declines in machinery, petroleum and a range of other goods. 
Wholesale stocks rose 0.3 percent in August. 
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.5 percent. 
That is more than the government estimated in its advance GDP estimate, which showed inventories sliced off 1.44 percentage points from growth in the third quarter, leaving output expanding at a 1.5 percent annual rate.
As result, economists expect third-quarter GDP growth could be revised up to as high as a 1.9 percent rate later this month.
""The third-quarter inventory correction now looks less severe than we had previously believed,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.5 percent in September after declining 0.9 percent in August. At September's sales pace it would take 1.31 months to clear shelves, unchanged from August, a still-high level that suggests businesses have little incentive to aggressively restock warehouses.

""There is a risk that the inventory correction may be more prolonged than we had previously believed,"" said Silver.

China’s businesses foresee a bleak year ahead of them and have cut revenue and profit forecasts over concerns of flagging demand and fewer new orders, according to a survey released Monday. The Markit survey showed business sentiment in the nation reached a record low.
Only 17 percent of Chinese businesses surveyed expected an increase in business activity in the next 12 months compared with 25 percent in June. Confidence waned in both the service and manufacturing sectors, according to the report, and the degree of optimism among Chinese companies was well below the global average of 25 percent.
“Worldwide business confidence is at the lowest ebb since the global financial crisis, dragged down by optimism slipping further to six-year lows in both China and India,"" Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said, in the report.
Employment growth -- an indicator that businesses expect to ramp up output -- also fell to fresh lows in the world’s second largest economy as manufacturers forecast lower head counts for the first time in the history of the survey.
Businesses cited relatively poor market conditions, changes to state policies, exchange rate movements and a lack of capital as threats to growth over the coming year.
Chinese companies could resort to price-discounting strategies in the year ahead to grab precious market share in the face of weak client demand and lower pricing pressures, Annabel Fiddes, an economist at Markit noted in the survey.
Other emerging economies -- such as Brazil, Russia and India -- also echoed China’s gloom, as only 18 percent of businesses in these nations expect business activity to rise by next year, the report said. In India, businesses see a grim 12 months ahead, according to the survey, with only 17 percent of the participants expecting an increase in business activity in the next 12 months -- the lowest since 2009."

China’s imports contracted further in October, according to reports citing official data released Sunday, as the world’s second largest economy struggled with sluggish domestic demand.
Imports tumbled 16 percent to 833.14 billion yuan ($131.2 billion) as China cut back on purchases of coal, steel, copper and aluminum used in its heavy industries. Meanwhile, exports were down 3.6 percent, a shade above the previous month's 3.7-percent contraction as foreign demand for Chinese goods also slowed. Overall, China's foreign trade dropped 9 percent, marking the eighth consecutive monthly decline.
China reported in October that its GDP grew at 6.9 percent in the third quarter -- its slowest since 2009 -- and President Xi Jinping announced that the government would seek an annual growth target of 6.5 percent through 2020, just days after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged that it won’t be easy for the country to reach its target of “about seven percent” growth for the year.
On Friday, China’s Ministry of Commerce released a report, cited by the China Daily, that said imports may fall substantially and exports are expected to remain flat, citing a sluggish global economy, high costs and slumping commodity prices. The country boosted its purchases of crude oil and soybean to take advantage of low prices, according to reports.
As Beijing looks to transition to a consumer-driven economy, lower property rates, overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and battered consumer confidence have presented challenges within China and abroad.
The fall in Chinese imports are also expected to spell trouble for resource-rich countries such as Australia and Brazil, which count China as a major client. And China's slowdown was also cited by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as a reason for delaying a hike in U.S. interest rates, which would be the first since 2009."
1170,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2015 02:20AM ET</span>","Chinese trade disappoints, clouding economic outlook","By Pete Sweeney and Winni Zhou
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade figures disappointed analyst expectations by a wide margin in October, reinforcing views that the world's second-largest economy will have to do more to stimulate domestic demand given softness in overseas markets.
While Beijing has repeatedly cut interest rates, the latest data showing an eighth monthly drop in net trade indicates persistent weakness in demand at home and abroad.
October exports fell 6.9 percent from a year ago, down for a fourth month, while imports slipped 18.8 percent, leaving the country with a record high trade surplus of $61.64 billion, the General Administration of Customs said on Sunday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected dollar-denominated exports to fall 3.0 percent and imports to decline 16.0 percent, an improvement over September's drop of 3.7 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively.
But the weak export reading shows that China might be getting less of a boost than hoped from overseas holiday shopping, while falling commodity import volumes highlight stubborn weakness in demand from key sectors like real estate and construction that Beijing has been trying to revive.
China's services sector, which has been one of the few bright spots in the economy, also lost some steam in October.
""We see that the trade will unlikely turn around the momentum in the near term, and the RMB exchange rate will be under downward pressure especially as Fed signals to hike soon,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) China economist Zhou Hao said.
EXPORTS TO DEVELOPED ECONOMIES WEAKEN
The decline in October exports was led by trade with developed economies, according to customs data.
Shipments to the United States dipped 0.9 percent on the year. Exports to the European Union dropped 2.9 percent and exports to Japan fell 7.7 percent.
Combined exports and imports are down 8.5 percent for the first 10 months of the year, well below the full-year official target for growth of 6 percent.
Last week, the Ministry of Commerce said the value of China's exports this year was likely to stay similar to 2014 levels, while imports could drop sharply in the fourth quarter.
For 2016, the ministry expects to see steady growth in combined exports and imports as policy measures to support the trade sector take effect.
POLICY MEASURES
In order to lower social financial costs for firms, the central bank cut interest rates in late October for the sixth time in less than a year, and again reduced the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves.
It has also guided the yuan into weaker territory against the dollar, but few believe Chinese exporters would benefit from anything short of a drastic devaluation.
In fact, Beijing wants to move away from its dependence on low-end export manufacturing to drive growth and move up the value chain into high-tech products and services. Keeping the exchange rate relatively strong is seen by many economists as a way to push the pace of upgrade after decades of coddling.
Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics noted that the yuan remained far stronger than it was a year ago even after the depreciation.
""China's trade weighted exchange rate was still 8.5 percent stronger than it was a year ago in September, and by itself this is hurting exporters, although weak global trade growth is a bigger problem.""

The country's economic growth dipped to 6.9 percent in the third quarter, dropping below the 7 percent mark for the first time since the global financial crisis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in October and the unemployment rate hit a 7-1/2-year low of 5.0 percent in a show of economic strength that makes it much more likely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 271,000 last month, the largest rise since December 2014, the Labor Department said on Friday. In addition, average hourly earnings rose a respectable 9 cents. The payrolls jump followed modest gains in August and September.
The unemployment rate now stands at its lowest level since April 2008 and is in a range many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment.
""The employment report had everything you could have asked for. It more than offsets the weakness in the prior two months and positions the Fed to hike rates in December,"" said Michelle Meyer, deputy U.S. chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) in New York.
The reaction in financial markets was swift and sharp.
The dollar rallied to a near seven-month high against a basket of currencies as investors braced for higher borrowing costs. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, with yields on the two-year note hitting a 5-1/2-year high. U.S. stocks ended mostly higher.
Rates futures implied a 70 percent chance of a Fed rate increase next month, up from 58 percent late on Thursday.
With speeches from several Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, suggesting a low bar for a December rate increase, economists had said ahead of the report that monthly job gains above 150,000 in October and November would be sufficient grounds for the first increase in overnight borrowing costs since 2006.
The U.S. central bank, which has held rates near zero for nearly seven years, has made clear, both in its statement after its October policy meeting and Yellen's subsequent comments, that a rate hike is firmly on the table at the Dec. 15-16 meeting.
""We've indicated that conditions look like they could be right for an increase,"" Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans, who has argued against a rate hike, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. ""The real side of the economy is looking a lot better.""
A Reuters survey of banks that deal directly with the Fed showed 15 of the 17 so-called primary dealers expect monetary policy tightening next month. That compared with only 12 dealers in September.
BROAD-BASED GAINS
Economists had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate remaining at 5.1 percent.
The report added to strong services sector and automobile sales data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy at the start of the fourth quarter. It bolstered views that growth will regain momentum this quarter after braking sharply to a 1.5 percent annual pace in the July-September period.
In addition to the unexpectedly stronger job gains last month, data for August and September were revised to show 12,000 more jobs created than previously reported.
Last month's rise in wages, which have been almost stagnant despite a tightening labor market, lifted the year-on-year reading to 2.5 percent. That was the biggest increase since July 2009 and could give the Fed confidence that inflation will gradually move towards its 2 percent target.
Combining hours, payroll gains and wages, a measure of take-home pay increased 0.6 percent in October, and was up 4.6 percent over the past 12 months.
 ""The economy has regained momentum just in time for the holiday shopping season,"" said Bob Hughes, senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
There were improvements in other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they contemplate a rate hike.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.8 percent, the lowest level since May 2008.
The employment-population ratio rose to 59.3 percent from 59.2 percent in September. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at a near 38-year low of 62.4 percent.
Employment gains in October were broad-based, though manufacturing added no jobs and mining shed 4,000 positions as oil and gas extraction payrolls fell 2,700.
Manufacturing has been hurt by a strong dollar, efforts by businesses to reduce bloated inventory and spending cuts by energy companies cutting back on well drilling and exploration in response to lower oil prices.
The mining sector has shed 109,000 jobs since peaking in December 2014. Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) last month announced further layoffs in addition to the 20,000 jobs it has already eliminated.
Construction payrolls, however, increased 31,000 last month, the biggest gain since February.
The services sector added 241,000 jobs in October, with large gains in retail, health and leisure. Professional and business services added 78,000 jobs, the largest gain since last November. Temporary help, a harbinger of future hiring, increased by 24,500 jobs, the biggest rise in nearly a year.

Government payrolls increased 3,000 last month.

1174,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 06, 2015 08:37AM ET</span>",US Unemployment Rate Drops To 5%,"By Angelo Young -

U.S. employers added a greater-than-expected 271,000 jobs in October, the best monthly showing of 2015. The unemployment rate fell to 5 percent, matching its lowest level since March 2008, the Labor Department said Friday. October’s gain follows two consecutive months of tepid employment growth and multiple months of hiring growth slowdown.
The solid October gain could build the case for the U.S. to start raising interest rates in December for the first time in nine years, raising the cost of borrowing for everything from business activity to credit card balances.
“The U.S. economy seems to be heading in the right direction,” Mark Hamrick, senior economist at Bankrate.com, said. “But we’ve been stuck in this modest or moderate mode of jobs growth for months. When we were in the final months of 2014 we were seeing a strong surge. We’re not going to see the same thing this year.”

The U.S. economy was forecast to add 180,000 nonfarm jobs last month, and the unemployment rate was expected to stand at 5.1 percent, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The U.S. economy added 3.1 million jobs last year, but with just two months left to go, the 2015 number is still shy of 2 million. Neverthess, October's number increases the liklihood of a December U.S. rate liftoff.
“The much-bigger-than-expected 271,000 surge in nonfarm payrolls in October confirms that the weakness in August and September was just a temporary blip, and given the circumstances, a December interest rate hike would now appear to be the most likely outcome,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.

The average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose by 9 cents to $25.20. For most workers, however, real wages have not kept pace with inflation for decades.
“Nominal wage growth has been hovering around 2 percent for the entire period of recovery since 2009,” said Irene Tung, a senior policy researcher at the National Employment Law Project. “Before that it was 3 percent, but the target should be around 3 1/2 to 4 percent.”
The labor force participation rate -- a measure of the number of people who are employed or are seeking employment -- was unchanged at 62.4 percent last month, its lowest since October 1977.
Employment in professional and business services rose by 77,000 in October, above the average monthly gain of 52,000 over the past 12 months. Jobs in the healthcare sector increased by 45,000, meanwhile, while retailers added 44,000 jobs.
Construction employment increased by 31,000 in October, while mining continued to trend downward, losing 5,000 jobs. Manufacturing jobs remained unchanged.
""Underneath the euphoria over a good top-line employment number is this fact: Manufacturing hasn't gained a single net job since January,” Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement Friday morning. “The effects of China's industrial overcapacity can be seen in waves of layoffs in American steel, aluminum and other manufacturing sectors.”"

The RBA assumed the trade-weighted exchange rate is about 2% lower than the assumption made in August, according to the Statement on Monetary Policy.
It assumed the cash rate will move in line with market pricing. By the end of Thursday the market was pricing in a maximum 34 basis points of cash-rate cut by August next year.
An important change in the outlook is a downgrade in growth for Australia's trading partners. The RBA now expects this growth at below its decade average over the next two years. The downgrade reflects persistent slowing in growth in Asia excluding China. The assumption for slowing in growth in China was unchanged from August.
""Growth in China is expected to moderate gradually over the forecast period largely as forecast previously. Weaker growth in investment and manufacturing production is expected to be offset, in part, by the effects of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy settings,"" the RBA said.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2015 11:46AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims rise; third-quarter productivity posts surprise gain,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. applications for unemployment benefits last week recorded their largest increase in eight months, but remained at levels consistent with a fairly healthy labor market.
Other data on Thursday showed a surprise rise in productivity in the third quarter after a drop in self-employment led to overall hours worked falling for the first time in six years, restraining labor-related production costs. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 for the week ended Oct.31, the Labor Department said. It was the largest weekly increase since late February. 
Still, last week marked the 35th straight week that claims were below the 300,000 threshold normally associated with a strong jobs market. Claims had hovered near 42-year lows for much of October. 
""There is no evidence that there has been a pickup in involuntary job separations and we continue to expect an increase of 200,000 in private payrolls in October,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 262,750 last week.
Last week's claims report has no bearing on the October employment report due for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls rose 180,000 in October, well above the average gain of 139,000 jobs for August and September. The unemployment rate is forecast at 5.1 percent.
Solid payroll gains in October could seal the case for a December interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17,000 to 2.16 million in the week ended Oct. 24. The four-week moving average of continuing claims, however, fell to the lowest level since November 2000.
The trend in continuing claims suggests more long-term unemployed are finding work, consistent with a low jobless rate.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while price for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
WEAK PRODUCTIVITY TREND
In a second report, the Labor Department said productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate after advancing at an upwardly revised 3.5 percent rate in the second quarter.
Manufacturing productivity grew at its fastest pace in four years, led by the durable goods sector. Economists had expected productivity to contract at a 0.2 percent rate in the July-September quarter after expanding at a previously reported 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter.
Despite the surprise rise in the third quarter, the trend in productivity remained weak. Productivity increased only 0.4 percent from the same period last year. That was a slowdown from 0.8 percent in the second quarter.
Economists blame softer productivity on a lack of investment, which they say has led to an unprecedented fall in capital intensity. 
""The nature of much tech investment these days may not be doing much to help productivity. Mobile apps that make it easier to waste time at work may be leisure enhancing, but they don't support labor productivity,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) in New York.    
While weak productivity has boosted employment growth as companies hired more workers to increase output, it has contributed to stagnant wages and lowered the economy's speed limit. Persistently anemic productivity could continue to limit wage growth even as the labor market approaches full employment.
In the third quarter, hours worked declined at a 0.5 percent rate, the first drop since the third quarter of 2009. That reflected a fall in self-employment as well as adjustments to hours for nonprofit and government enterprise workers.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 1.4 percent rate in the third quarter after dropping at a 1.8 percent rate in the prior quarter. Unit labor costs rose 2.0 percent compared to last year.
Economists say a tightening labor market could boost productivity as employers seek to cut production-related costs.

""As qualified labor is becoming scarce and the unemployment rate has now reached a level that historically has been associated with building wage pressures, firms may be more motivated to invest in labor-saving equipment that could lead to an acceleration in output per hour,"" said Kevin Cummins (N:CMI), a senior economist at RBS (L:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending October 31 increased by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 from the previous week’s total of 260,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 262,000.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 34 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended October 24 rose to 2.163 million from 2.146 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.144 million.
The four-week moving average was 262,750, an increase of 3,500 from the previous week’s total of 259,250. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

All nine members were in favor of making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.

The discussion came tree weeks before the BoJ pushed back the timing for hitting its inflation target.
Many members believed the year-on-year rise in the CPI would accelerate as the base effect of last year's plunge in crude oil prices dissipated and would reach around 2% ""around the first half of fiscal 2016"" because the output gap and inflation expectations were ""likely to improve steadily and increase.""
""These members continued that, however, the timing of reaching 2% could be either earlier or later to some extent, depending on developments in crude oil prices.""
At its Oct. 30 policy meeting, the board again pushed back the estimated timing of achieving its 2% inflation target to ""around the second half of fiscal 2016"" from around the first six months of that year as the slump in energy prices lingers and the pace of wage hikes is slow. It last delayed the timing in April.
""Members shared the recognition that, in order to achieve the price stability target of 2%, it was important that the inflation rate rise moderately accompanied by an increase in wages,"" the minutes said, showing the board repeated its view.
""In this regard, many members expressed the view that the pace of increase in nominal wages remained moderate, despite record-high corporate profits.""
At the Oct. 6-7 meeting, the BoJ board decided by an 8 to 1 vote to leave the bank's policy target unchanged, as largely expected, although the risk of a technical recession was growing amid slowing global and domestic demand.
""A few members said that the outlook for the economy was highly uncertain and that the risk of it slowing for longer than expected warranted attention.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers maintained a steady pace of hiring in October and a jump in new orders buoyed activity in the services sector, suggesting the economy was strong enough to support an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December.
The economic outlook was further brightened by another report on Wednesday showing the trade deficit hit a seven-month low in September as exports rebounded, a tentative sign the worst of the drag from the stronger dollar may be over.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday the U.S. economy is ""performing well"" and a December rate hike could be justified.
""You have a set of data thus far that tells the Fed that things are in good shape going into the fourth quarter and is giving them the green light to go,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased 182,000 last month on top of the 190,000 jobs added in September. Job gains last month were broad-based, though manufacturing lost 2,000 positions.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls increased 180,000 in October, well above the average gain of 139,000 jobs for August and September. 
Economists say the expected October job gains would be seen as sufficient for the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting. The unemployment rate is forecast to be steady at 5.1 percent.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index rose to 59.1 last month from a reading of 56.9 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
A gauge of new orders received by services industries rose a sturdy 5.3 percentage points to 62 and employment increased to 59.2 percent from a reading of 58.3 in September. Fourteen services industries reported growth last month. Only mining reported a contraction. 
""It suggests that the service sector has hardly skipped a beat despite signs of weakness in other parts of the economy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""The U.S. economic recovery is off to a very strong start in the fourth quarter after the subpar performance in the third quarter.""
The economy expanded at a 1.5 percent annual rate in the July-September period, hurt by a slow pace of inventory accumulation and ongoing spending cuts by energy firms.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, getting an additional boost from Yellen's comments. U.S. stocks and prices for Treasury debt fell.
IMPROVING FORTUNES
The economy's improving fortunes also were underscored by a report on Tuesday showing auto sales hit a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 18.2 million vehicles in October, the best performance for that month since 2001.
That was reinforced by a third report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department showing the trade gap fell 15 percent to $40.8 billion in September, the smallest deficit since February. Lower crude oil prices also helped to curb the import bill. 
The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, undercutting export growth. Lackluster global demand also has put a damper on exports.
Exports in September rose 1.6 percent to $187.9 billion, with exports of services hitting a record high. There were increases in exports of capital goods and automobiles. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, however, were the lowest since October 2010.
Imports fell 1.8 percent to $228.7 billion, the lowest level since February. They had received a boost in August from Apple's (O:AAPL) new iPhone model. Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell to near a six-year low. 
Petroleum imports were the lowest since May 2004, reflecting increased domestic energy production and lower oil prices. Petroleum prices averaged $42.72 per barrel in September, down from $49.33 in August and $92.52 in September 2014.

Imports from China hit a record high in September, leaving the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at an all-time high of $36.3 billion. That was up 3.8 percent from August.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2015 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. September trade deficit smallest in seven months,"WASHINGTON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in September to its lowest level in seven months as exports rebounded, a tentative sign that the worst of
the drag from a stronger dollar may be over. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade gap fell 15 percent to $40.8 billion, the smallest deficit since February. Lower crude oil prices also helped to curb the import bill. 
The drop in the trade deficit reversed the widening seen in August, though the prior month's figure was revised slightly down to $48 billion from the previously reported $48.3 billion. Economists had forecast the trade gap shrinking to $41.1 billion in September. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $57.2 billion in September from $63.0 billion in the prior month.
Trade had a neutral impact on gross domestic product for the third quarter, which expanded at a 1.5 percent annual rate. The sharp step-down in growth from the second quarter's brisk 3.9 percent rate mainly reflected a slow pace of inventory accumulation and ongoing spending cuts by energy firms.
The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, undercutting export growth. Lackluster global demand also has put a damper on exports.
Exports in September rose 1.6 percent to $187.9 billion, with exports of services hitting a record high. There were increases in exports of capital goods and automobiles. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, however, were the lowest
since October 2010.
Exports to Canada, the European Union and China rose in September. Exports to Japan, however, fell 13.8 percent to their lowest level since April 2010. Imports fell 1.8 percent to $228.7 billion, the lowest level since February. They had received a boost in August from Apple's new iPhone model. 
Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell to the lowest level since August 2009. Petroleum imports were the lowest since May 2004, reflecting increased domestic energy production and lower oil prices.
The price of petroleum averaged $42.72 per barrel in September, down from $49.33 in August and $92.52 in September 2014.

Imports from China hit a record high in September, leaving the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at an all-time high of $36.3 billion. That was up 3.8 percent from August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a second straight month in September as the manufacturing sector continues to struggle under the weight of a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies.
Motor vehicle production, however, remains a bright spot as orders surged in September. That trend is likely to persist as automakers reported on Tuesday that sales in October were the best in 14 years.
""This morning's report provides little new signal on the state of U.S. manufacturing. Demand for many categories of manufactured goods continues to struggle from the effect of a stronger dollar, weak foreign demand and lower energy prices,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York.
The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods declined 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 2.1 percent drop in August. Factory orders were previously reported to have declined 1.7 percent in August.
Orders for automobiles and parts rose 1.5 percent in September after falling 2.0 percent in August.
Auto sales jumped 13.6 percent in October from a year ago to an annual rate of 18.24 million units, the highest October level since 2001, according to Autodata Corp. Sales rose to a 18.17 million-unit rate in September.
October's increase suggested that consumer spending remained robust after two straight quarters of strong increases and bolsters expectations of a December interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. government debt prices fell.
Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is also being constrained by efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang and tepid global demand. But the worst could be over for the sector after a report on Monday showed new orders rose in October for the first time since July.
The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinational corporations like Procter & Gamble Co. (N:PG) and 3M Co. (N:MMM).
At the same time, a plunge in oil prices has pressured revenues for oil field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and diversified manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT).
INVENTORIES BEING LIQUIDATED
The factory orders report also showed a 0.4 percent drop in manufacturing inventories, which was bigger than the government had assumed for its advance third-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last week.
Economists said the factory inventory drop suggested the third-quarter GDP estimate could be lowered by at least one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent annual pace when the government publishes its first revision later this month.
A slow pace of inventory accumulation accounted for the bulk of the sharp step-down in growth from the second quarter's brisk 3.9 percent rate.
Still, the September drop in factory inventories is an encouraging sign for the sector as it suggests orders will rise in the months ahead. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at a still lofty 1.35 in September.
""A steady pace of liquidation will eventually boost output as orders move closer to sales and input utilization levels,"" said Kevin Cummins (N:CMI), senior economist at RBS (L:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Manufacturers reported on Monday a decrease in the share of customers who believed inventories were too high, and a fall in the stock of unsold goods at factories in October.
The Commerce Department also reported that September orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – slipped 0.1 percent instead of the 0.3 percent drop initially reported last month.

This also supports the view that the worst of the manufacturing slump might be over. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, increased 0.5 percent in September as reported last month.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in the Asian region, continuing US growth and a recovery in Europe. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease monetary policy. Volatility in financial markets has abated somewhat for the moment. While credit costs for some emerging market countries remain higher than a year ago, global financial conditions overall remain very accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues. While GDP growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, business surveys suggest a gradual improvement in conditions over the past year. This has been accompanied by somewhat stronger growth in employment and a steady rate of unemployment.
Inflation is low and should remain so, with the economy likely to have a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. Inflation is forecast to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years, but a little lower than earlier expected.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing will reduce this support slightly, overall conditions are still quite accommodative. Credit growth has increased a little over recent months, with growth in lending to investors in the housing market easing slightly while that for owner-occupiers appears to be picking up. Dwelling prices continue to rise in Melbourne and Sydney, though the pace of growth has moderated of late. Growth in dwelling prices has remained mostly subdued in other cities. Supervisory measures are helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market.
In other asset markets, prices for commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices have moved in parallel with developments in global markets. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
At today's meeting the Board judged that the prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months and that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Members also observed that the outlook for inflation may afford scope for further easing of policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. The Board will continue to assess the outlook, and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in October for a fourth straight month, but a rise in new orders offered hope for a sector buffeted by a strong dollar and relentless spending cuts by energy companies.
Other data on Monday showed construction spending rose in September, indicating the economy remained on firmer ground despite some cooling in consumer spending and persistent weakness in manufacturing. 
The Institute for Supply Management said its national manufacturing index slipped to 50.1 this month from a reading of 50.2 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.
New orders rose to 52.9 from 50.1 in September. However, the employment index fell to 47.6, the lowest reading since August 2009. It was the first time it had dropped below 50 since April.
U.S. stocks moved higher after the data, while prices of U.S. government debt fell. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also been slammed by business efforts to reduce an inventory overhang and slowing demand overseas. 
The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, squeezing the profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (N:PG) and 3M Co. (N:MMM).
At the same time, a plunge in oil prices has pressured revenues for oil field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and diversified manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT).
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING UP
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending advanced 0.6 percent to $1.09trillion, the highest level since March 2008, after an unrevised 0.7 percent increase in August. 
Construction spending has increased every month this year, and the latest gain suggested a modest upward revision to the third-quarter GDP growth estimate. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast constructions pending rising 0.5 percent in September. Construction outlays were up 14.1 percent compared to September of last year.
September's increase is slightly above the gain the government had estimated in its advance third-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last week. 
The government reported the economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter, hurt by business efforts to reduce an inventory glut and continued spending cuts by energy firms. A strong dollar also hurt the economy.
Data last week suggested consumer spending lost momentum at the end of the third quarter, with consumption in September posting its smallest increase in eight months. A report on Monday was expected to show a further slowdown in factory activity in October. In September, construction spending was boosted by a 0.6 percent rise in private construction spending, which hit its highest level since January 2008. 
Spending on private residential construction jumped 1.9 percent in September, also reaching the highest level since January 2008, reflecting gains in home building and renovations. Investment on private non-residential construction projects, however, fell 0.7 percent.

Public construction outlays gained 0.7 percent. Spending on state and local government projects, which is the largest portion of the public sector segment, increased 0.9 percent. Federal government outlays declined 1.0 percent.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2015 05:10AM ET</span>",U.S. small-business borrowing rose in September: PayNet,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - U.S. small businesses boosted borrowing in September, an index released on Monday showed, a sign that more firms are betting on an increase in household spending in the coming months.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index increased to 140.4 in September from a downwardly revised reading of 135.6 reading in August. It was up 11 percent from a year earlier, led by firms borrowing in the transportation, warehousing, construction, accommodation, food, healthcare and real estate industries.
""It's consumer, consumer, consumer,"" said Bill Phelan, President of PayNet. ""This above-average growth trend means that small business is going to deliver material amounts of growth to GDP in the fourth quarter.""
The index, which hit a record in June, has historically tracked ahead of U.S. gross domestic product growth by two to five months.
U.S. GDP growth cooled to a 1.5 percent annual pace last quarter, although consumer spending was a bright spot.
The Federal Reserve said last week it will decide whether to raise rates in December based on actual and projected progress toward its goals of 2-percent inflation and full employment.
Many officials see economic growth of 2 percent or more as strong enough to bring the unemployment rate, now at 5.1 percent, down further.
The Atlanta Fed currently forecasts U.S. growth of about 2.5 percent in the current quarter.
The delinquency rate on loans more than 30 days past due ticked up to 1.45 percent in September from 1.44 percent the prior month, separate data from PayNet showed.

PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 250 leading U.S. lenders.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.5 last month from a reading of 51.8 in September. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 51.3 in October.
The 3.7 point gain in the PMI level was one of the steepest registered during the near 24-year survey history.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
October saw solid improvements in the rates of growth in output and new orders, in both cases the sharpest since the middle of last year.
The domestic market remained the prime source of new contract wins, while back-to-back increases in new export business were signalled for the first time since the third quarter of 2014.
Commenting on the report, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said, “Based on historical comparisons, the survey is consistent with a quarterly rate of growth of around 1%, a vast improvement on what we have seen in recent months.""
GBP/USD was trading at 1.5491 from around 1.5454 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7118 from 0.7137 earlier.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.4 in October, slightly less than a preliminary reading of 52.5 but a solid improvement from the final reading of 51.0 in September.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the sixth straight month. October's performance was the strongest in a year.
The findings add to evidence that the world's third-largest economy is recovering from a dip earlier this year as demand at home and abroad is starting to pick up.
The PMI for new export orders was 52.2 in October, just above a preliminary 52.1 and showing a return to growth from 48.0 in the previous month.
The index for overall new orders - both those at home and abroad - was 54.2 in October. This was less than the flash reading of 54.9 but still the fastest expansion in a year.
Japan's economy contracted in April-June and there is a chance it could contract again in July-September.
However, upbeat PMI data for October could support the argument that domestic demand is finally improving and that overseas demand is starting to shake off the impact of slowdowns in China and other emerging markets.
Data last week showing an unexpected rise in September industrial output was another sign that the economy is starting to grow again.

Rhe Bank of Japan held off on expanding its already massive stimulus program on Friday, preferring to save its dwindling policy options in the hope that the economy can overcome the drag from China's slowdown without additional monetary support.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly contracted in October for a third straight month, an official survey showed on Sunday, fuelling fears the economy may still be losing momentum in the fourth quarter despite a raft of stimulus measures.
Adding to those concerns, China's services sector, which has been one of the few bright spots in the economy, also showed signs of cooling last month, expanding at its slowest pace in nearly seven years.
As the first major indicators of business conditions in China released each month, the PMIs reinforced the view that the economy remains in the midst of a gradual slowdown which will require Beijing to roll out more support in coming months.
""While the PMI has stabilized, it is too early to confirm a bottoming out,"" economists at ANZ Bank said in a note.
""As deflation risks intensify, a further RRR cut before end of this year is still possible,"" ANZ said, referring to reducing the amount of reserves that banks must hold in order to free up more funds for new loans.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) was at 49.8 in October, the same pace as in previous month and lagging market expectations of 50.0, according to the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS). A reading below 50 points suggests an contraction.
New export orders contracted for a 13th straight month, though the sub-index for new orders - a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand - edged up marginally to 50.3, compared with September's 50.2.
Faced with persistently weak demand, factory owners continued to lay off workers and at a slightly faster pace than in September.
""Because of the recent weak recovery in the global economy and downward pressure in the domestic economy, manufacturers still face a severe import and export situation,"" Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS said in a statement accompanying the data.
Major Chinese construction machinery maker Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd said on Friday it swung to a loss in the third quarter, affected by a glut of unsold equipment.
As for the services sector, whose growth has helped offset persistent weakness in manufacturing, the official non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.1 in October from September's 53.4. Though still a solid pace of expansion, it was the lowest reading since late 2008 during the global financial crisis, a similar survey showed.
SMALL FIRMS FACING BIGGER STRESSES
Despite authorities' most aggressive policy easing campaign since the 2008/09 global crisis, small- and mid-sized Chinese firms are still starved for funds due to banks' preferences to lend to big, state-owned companies.
Activity in small and mid-sized firms continued to contract in October, with more small firms seeing fund shortages compared to big ones, the official survey showed. Small companies account for up to 80 percent of urban employment and 60 percent of China's GDP.
China's economy grew 6.9 percent between July and September from a year earlier, dipping below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis, though some market watchers believe real growth rates are much weaker than government figures suggest.
Chinese leaders have been trying to reassure jittery global markets for months that the economy is under control after a shock devaluation of the yuan and a summer stock market plunge fanned fears of a hard landing.
The government has cut interest rates six times since November and lowered the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year. The latest cut in interest rates and banks' reserve requirement came on Oct 23.
Beijing has also quickened spending on infrastructure and eased curbs on the ailing property sector. The latter have helped revive weak home sales and prices but have not yet reversed a sharp decline in property investment.

Many economists had expected economic growth would bottom out in the third quarter, with a modest improvement late this year and into early 2016 as additional stimulus measures gradually take effect.

To shore up growth, the government has cut interest rates six times since November and lowered the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year. The latest cut in interest rates and banks' reserve requirement came in late October.

Beijing has also ramped up infrastructure spending and eased restrictions on home purchases to revive the flagging property market.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2015 12:57PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. data clouds December rate hike possibility ,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending in September recorded its smallest gain in eight months as personal income barely rose, suggesting some cooling in domestic demand after recent hefty increases.
The Commerce Department data and another report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed weak inflationary pressures, which would argue against the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the end of the year.
U.S. central bank policymakers this week put a rate hike in December on the table with a direct reference to their final meeting of the year. The Fed has kept benchmark overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008.
""It will be difficult for the Fed to justify a rate hike at a time when income, consumption, and inflation are trending lower, leaving a December rate hike less likely than prior to the data,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent rise in August. September's consumer spending data was included in Thursday's third-quarter gross domestic product report.
Consumer spending rose at a brisk 3.2 percent annual pace in the third quarter, helping to lift GDP growth to a 1.5 percent rate. Consumption has increased at a rate of more than 3 percent in each of the last two quarters.
Third-quarter growth was constrained by business efforts to whittle down an inventory bloat, a strong dollar and ongoing spending cuts by energy companies.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading marginally lower, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
WEAK INFLATION
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in September after increasing 0.4 percent in August, suggesting consumption will continue to support the economy through the rest of the year.
That view also was bolstered by a separate report showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rebounded in October from September. Consumer spending growth, however, is unlikely to maintain the brisk pace witnessed in the second and third quarters in the absence of a significant rise in income.
Income ticked up 0.1 percent as wages and salaries fell last month, especially in manufacturing, after rising 0.4 percent in August.
""Stronger income growth is needed to support stronger consumer spending,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
With spending sluggish, inflation was weak last month. A price index for consumer spending slipped 0.1 percent, the first decline since January, after being flat in August.
In the 12 months through September, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2 percent, the smallest increase since April, after increasing 0.3 percent in August.
Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1 percent for a fifth straight month. The so-called core PCE price index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through September after a similar gain in August.
Inflation has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target. A report from the Labor Department showed the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after a 0.2 percent gain in the second quarter.
In the 12 months through September, labor costs held steady at 2.0 percent, below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's target.
""We are still in a modest compensation-gain environment and that implies inflation is not likely to accelerate sharply soon,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania.

""The labor market may be tight but firms appear to be in no great hurry to raise compensation.""

In the semi-annual Outlook Report due at 0600 GMT, the BoJ is likely to lower its economic forecasts for this fiscal year and may also push back the estimated timing of achieving its 2% inflation target again to ""around fiscal 2016"" from ""around the first half of fiscal 2016.""
The most likely scenario is the board will trim its GDP forecast. So far, the BoJ's assessment of the two main drivers of inflation has been unchanged: longer-term inflation expectations are rising and the negative output gap is unlikely to hurt the underlying price trend, which is backed by tight labor supply, because the GDP slump in April-June was mainly caused by an export drop.
At Friday's one-day policy meeting, board member Takahide Kiuchi again proposed lowering the scale of the monetary base and Japanese government bond buying to ¥45 trillion. His proposal was again voted down by the rest of the board.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 1.0 percent last month.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's decrease suggests a softening in home sales after more robust levels earlier this year.

The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday the U.S. economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 3.9 percent in the second quarter. Third-quarter growth in gross domestic product was fueled by personal consumption and state and local government spending. The number was in line with projections that ranged from 0.9 percent to 2.4 percent, according to economists polled by Bloomberg.
“The deceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected a downturn in private inventory investment and decelerations in exports,” the department said in its quarterly statement.
The lackluster GDP figure indicates how the U.S. economy has handled a global downturn led by the slowest growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, since 1990. Weak global demand adversely impacts U.S. exports while a strengthening dollar pummels U.S. corporate earnings made abroad in foreign currencies."

Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 2.75 percent.
Global economic growth is below average and global inflation is low despite highly stimulatory monetary policy. Financial market volatility has eased in recent weeks, but concerns remain about the prospects for slower growth in China and East Asia especially. Financial markets are also uncertain about the timing and effects of monetary policy tightening in the United States and possible easings elsewhere.
The sharp fall in dairy prices since early 2014 continues to weigh on domestic farm incomes. However, growth in the services sector and construction remains robust, driven by net immigration, tourism, and low interest rates. Global dairy prices have risen in recent weeks, contributing to improved household and business sentiment. However, it is too early to say whether these recent improvements will be sustained.
House price inflation in Auckland remains strong, posing a financial stability risk. While residential building is accelerating, it will take some time to correct the supply shortfall. The Government has introduced new tax requirements and the Reserve Bank’s new LVR restrictions on investor lending come into effect on 1 November.
CPI inflation remains below the 1 to 3 percent target range, largely reflecting a combination of earlier strength in the New Zealand dollar and the 60 percent fall in world oil prices since mid-2014.
Annual CPI inflation is expected to return well within the target range by early 2016, as the effects of earlier petrol price falls drop out of the CPI calculation and in response to the fall in the exchange rate since April. However, the exchange rate has been moving higher since September, which could, if sustained, dampen tradables sector activity and medium-term inflation. This would require a lower interest rate path than would otherwise be the case.
Continued economic expansion is expected to result in some pick-up in non-tradables inflation, despite the moderating effects of strong labour supply growth.
To ensure that future average CPI inflation settles near the middle of the target range, some further reduction in the OCR seems likely. This will continue to depend on the emerging flow of economic data. It is appropriate at present to watch and wait.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2015 04:50AM ET</span>",China Oct official PMI seen edging up to 50.0 but still tepid ,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector likely picked up slightly in October but remained subdued, a Reuters poll showed, fuelling hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be bottoming out after a burst of stimulus measures.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) likely edged up to 50.0 in October from 49.8 in September, according to a median forecast of 20 economists in a Reuters poll.
Still, the expected improvement remained marginal, with the reading at the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis.
Factory activity shrank in September for a second straight month, albeit at a slower pace than in August.
""Stimulus measures continued to gain traction in October, which would be conducive for large and state factories,"" said Zhang Yiping, an analyst at Merchants Securities in Shenzhen.
To shore up growth, the government has cut interest rates six times since November and lowered the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year. The latest cut in interest rates and banks' reserve requirement came last Friday.
Beijing has rolled out a flurry of steps since last year, including quickening spending on infrastructure and easing curbs on the ailing property sector. The latter have helped revive weak home sales and prices but have not yet reversed a sharp decline in property investment.
Data released last week showed China's economy grew 6.9 percent between July and September from a year earlier, dipping below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis.
Some analysts hope the third-quarter cooldown could mark the low point for 2015 as a burst of stimulus measures rolled out by Beijing gradually take effect in coming months, but muted monthly data for September kept such optimism in check.
The official PMI survey focuses more on larger, state-owned firms while another private one on the small and mid-sized companies, which are facing tougher financial and operating conditions.

The official PMI factory numbers will be released on Sunday, Nov.1, alongside the official services PMI. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI will be released on Nov.2.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment plans fell for a second straight month in September, the latest indication that economic growth braked sharply in the third quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxyfor business spending plans, slipped 0.3 percent last month after a downwardly revised 1.6 percent decline in August.
These so-called core capital goods were previously reported to have dropped 0.8 percent August. The data was the latest dour news for the manufacturing sector, which has been hobbled by a strong dollar and deep spending cuts in the energy sector.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has also been hit by efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bulge and by slowing global demand.
The downbeat report added to weak trade, retail sales and industrial production data that have suggested the economy lost significant momentum in the third quarter. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, gross domestic product likely expanded at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, slowing from a brisk 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. The government will publish its advance third-quarter GDP estimate on Thursday.
The dollar has gained 15.4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, undermining the profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (N:PG) and 3M Co. (N:MMM). 
A plunge in oil prices has squeezed revenues for oil field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and diversified manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT).
Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said this month it did not expect a recovery in demand before 2017 and anticipated that exploration and production spending would fall for a second consecutive year in 2016.
The continued weakness in business spending, together with signs of a slowdown in hiring by companies, could raise further doubts on whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee was due to convene a two-day meeting on Tuesday. 
The dollar fell to session lows against the euro and the yen on the data. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose to session highs. 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.5 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.8 percent drop in August. 
Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have dropped 0.4 percent in August. 
A 2.9 percent decline in transportation equipment spending helped to weigh down overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which fell 1.2 percent last month. Transportation was dragged down by a 35.7 percent decline in aircraft orders. Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 29 orders last month, down from 52 aircraft in August. Orders for automobiles and parts rebounded 1.8 percent.

Durable goods inventories fell 0.3 percent, the largest drop since May 2013, while unfilled orders declined 0.6 percent.

1331,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 27, 2015 06:01AM ET</span>",UK Q3 GDP Slows To 0.5%,"By Arjun Kashyap -

Growth in the U.K. slowed to 0.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics announced Tuesday, following a decline in activity in the country's construction and manufacturing sectors.
ONS estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 0.5 percent in the July-September quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous quarter. Economists polled by Bloomberg reportedly expected the economy to grow at 0.6 percent. However, compared to the same quarter in 2014, GDP was 2.3 percent higher, according to ONS.
“While growth has slowed from the previous quarter, the economy overall is still expanding steadily,” Joe Grice, the chief economist at the ONS, reportedly said. “The sectoral pattern is mixed. Growth in the services sector has been robust but both manufacturing and construction output have shown falls.”
According to ONS data, output increased in three main sectors -- services (0.7 percent), production (0.3 percent) and agriculture (0.5 percent). Growth in the construction sector slowed by 2.2 percent -- the most since 2012, according to Bloomberg.
In the third quarter, GDP was estimated to have been 6.4 percent higher than the pre-economic downturn peak seen in the first quarter of 2008, ONS reported, adding that the nation's economy shrank by 6.1 percent in the period between 2008 March quarter and the June 2009 quarter.
The data released Tuesday is a preliminary estimate of GDP, which can change as more data become available, ""but these revisions are typically small between the preliminary and third estimates of GDP,"" according to ONS.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales fell to near a one-year low in September after two straight months of gains, suggesting a temporary cooling in the market for new houses. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday sales dropped 11.5percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 units, the lowest level since November 2014. August's sales pace was revised down to 529,000 units from the previously reported 552,000 units. 
The moderation in new home sales is likely to be short-lived as other housing reports have painted an upbeat picture of the sector. In addition, new home sales tend to be volatile month to month because they are drawn from a small sample.
New home sales account for 7.8 percent of the housing market. September data on existing home sales, homebuilder confidence and housing starts have been fairly strong.
The housing index (HGX) fell more than 1 percent on the data, in line with a weaker stock market. D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, dropped 2.31 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, fell 1.5 percent. 
Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
A sturdy housing market is supporting consumer spending through an increase in household wealth, which is helping to soften the blow on the economy from faltering global growth, a strong dollar and weak capital spending in the energy sector.
Efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bloat also have weighed on growth, leaving gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter running below a 2.0 percent annualized rate. 
The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter. The government will publish its advance third-quarter GDP estimate on Thursday.
Economists forecast new home sales slipping to only a rate of 550,000 units. Sales were up 2.0 percent compared to September of last year.
New home sales tumbled 61.8 percent in the Northeast to the lowest level since April. Sales declined 6.7 percent in the West and were down 8.7 percent in the populous South. In the Midwest, sales fell 8.3 percent.

With sales weak, the stock of new houses for sale increased 4.2 percent to 225,000 last month, the highest level since March 2010. Still, supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom. At September's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in August. The median price of a new home rose 13.5 percent from a year ago to $296,900.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rebounded strongly in September and new applications for unemployment benefits hovered around 42-year lows last week, pointing at solid domestic fundamentals even as the global economy falters.
Thursday's upbeat housing and labor market reports could keep the door open to an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve by the end of the year.
""The market has been a little bit quick to price out a December Fed rate hike. What you are seeing in the data is that the domestic picture looks strong and I think that's what the Fed is going to be looking at closely,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Bank in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 4.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.55 million units last month, almost erasing August's decline.
A firming housing market is boosting household wealth, driving a robust pace of consumer spending. In turn, strong domestic demand is helping to cushion the blow on the economy from softening global growth, a strong dollar and weak capital spending in the energy sector.
Growth has also been squeezed by efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bulge, leaving gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter running below a 1.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
Housing, however, remains constrained by a dearth of properties available for sale. But rising house prices could encourage homeowners to put their houses on the market.
The median price for a previously owned home rose 6.1 percent in September from a year ago. Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories.
The stock of houses on the market fell 2.6 percent in September from August. At September's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.1 months in August. A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
The housing index (HGX) fell 0.43 percent, underperforming a broadly firmer stock market. Shares in D.R. Horton (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, declined 1.59 percent.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.90 percent.
The dollar rallied against the euro on the data and dovish comments from the European Central Bank. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds fell.
FIRMING JOBS MARKET
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended Oct. 17. 
Still, they remained not too far from levels last seen in late 1973 and it was the 33rd straight week that claims were below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with a firming jobs market.
At current levels, there is not much scope for claims to fall further and the very low level of layoffs suggests the labor market remains in good shape, despite a recent abrupt slowdown in job growth.
""These data signal that companies remain extremely unwilling to let go of labor and that the number of short-term unemployed remains very low,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 2,000 to 263,250 last week, the lowest level since December 1973.
The claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of October's unemployment report. The four-week moving average of claims fell 9,250 between the September and October survey periods. That suggested a pick-up in job gains this month.
Nonfarm payroll gains in August and September averaged 139,000, the weakest two-month rise since January last year. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 6,000 to 2.17 million in the week ended Oct. 10. 
The four-week moving average of continuing claims was the lowest since late 2000, suggesting a further decline in the unemployment rate from 5.1 percent in September.

""With August and September being notorious for initially under-reporting job gains, today's data add to the case that employment growth will pick up in October and the unemployment rate will continue to grind lower,"" said Ryding.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales increased 4.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.55 million units.
August's sales pace was revised slightly lower to 5.30 million units from the previously reported 5.31 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales rising to a 5.38 million-unit pace last month. Sales were up 8.8 percent from a year ago.
Sales increased in all four regions of the United States and inventory continued to tighten. Unsold inventory was down to a 4.8-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 5.1 months in August and 5.4 months a year ago.
""As we enter more softer demand months, we may not really feel the squeeze of tight inventory, but come spring of next year ... we could be facing a very tight inventory situation,"" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.
Nationwide, the medium home price fell to $221,900. That was still an increase of 6.1 percent from one year ago. 
The stable pace of home resales in September follows Tuesday's strong housing starts data, which was buoyed by increased demand for rental apartments. 

Housing has steadily improved relative to the rest of the U.S. economy, which has been buffeted by soft global demand, a strong dollar, and weak capital spending in the energy sector.

Existing-home sales rebounded strongly in September following August’s decline and have now increased year-over-year for 12 consecutive months. All four major regions experienced sales gains in September.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says a slight moderation in home prices in some markets and mortgage rates remaining below 4% gave more households the confidence to close on a home last month.

Inflation has evolved in line with the outlook in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report. Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the Bank’s target range, owing to declines in consumer energy prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual export growth slowed to a crawl in September as shrinking sales to China hurt the volume of shipments, raising fears that weak overseas demand may have pushed the economy into recession.
Ministry of Finance data showed exports rose just 0.6 percent in the year to September, against a 3.4 percent gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
That was the slowest growth since August last year, following the prior month's 3.1 percent gain. The weak yen helped increase the value of exports, but volume fell 3.9 percent, the third straight month recording an annual decline.
Wednesday's data was the first major indicator for September and is part of the calculation of third quarter gross domestic product. A third quarter contraction would put Japan into recession, following the second quarter's negative GDP result, and could force policy makers to offer further stimulus.
""Given this data, the economy probably contracted about an annualized 0.5 percent in July-September. External demand, capital spending and inventory investment were a likely drag, while consumption picked up,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
China's slowdown and soft domestic demand weighed on factory output and the broader economy, although the Bank of Japan saw the effects of China's slowdown as limited for now, sticking to its rosy growth outlook.
Still, weak indicators will keep the central bank under pressure to ease policy again to hit its ambitious 2 percent inflation target next year.
Some analysts expect the BOJ to move at its Oct. 30 monetary meeting, when it also issues long-term economic and price projections.
""Weak exports were within the BOJ's expectations so this data alone could not be a trigger. But there's no doubt that pressure will mount on the BOJ to act if weakness persists,"" said Taro Saito, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
Separate data by the BOJ, which captures trade movements in real terms by eliminating price effects, showed real exports rose 0.2 percent in July-September while real imports grew 2.6 percent. This suggests net exports weighed on third-quarter GDP, said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) Securities Japan.
CHINA SYNDROME HITS TRADE POWERHOUSES
China's economic growth has dipped below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis, despite a barrage of stimulus measures.
Flow-on effects of the slowdown are spreading though Asia, with South Korean exports tumbling while Taiwan's export orders continued to slide recently, sapping Asia's trade powerhouses.
The MOF data showed China-bound exports fell 3.5 percent year-on-year in September, down for a second straight month on falling shipments of light oil and car parts.
Shipments to Asia - which account for about a half of Japan's overall exports - fell 0.9 percent in September, the first annual decline in seven months.
Exports to the United States, a major buyer of Japanese products, rose 10.4 percent in September, led by shipments of cars. In volume terms, however, U.S.-bound exports fell 4.7 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts rose solidly in September on soaring demand for rental apartments, a sign that the housing market continues to steadily improve even as economic growth has slowed.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday groundbreaking increased 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.21 million units. It was the sixth straight month that starts were above 1 million units, pointing to a sustainable housing recovery. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking on new homes rising to a 1.15 million-unit pace last month. 
Housing is one of the few bright spots in the economy, which has been slammed by softening global demand and a strong dollar, which have undercut exports. Efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bulge and weak capital spending in the energy sector have also been a drag.
Economic activity has braked sharply, with third-quarter growth estimates running below a 1.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
Although residential construction accounts for less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, housing has a broader impact on the economy, with rising home prices boosting household wealth and therefore supporting consumer spending.
The dollar slipped against the euro, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt were little changed.
Starts for multi-family projects surged 18.3 percent to a 466,000 unit pace, the highest level since June. Multi-family construction is being driven by demand for rentals, especially by millennials, who cannot afford to buy their own homes because of higher prices and debt burdens. 
Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.3 percent to a 740,000 unit pace. Economists say single-family building is being constrained by land and labor shortages. 
Starts in the South, where most of the home construction takes place, rose 0.6 percent to their highest level since October 2007. Groundbreaking on housing projects in the West was the highest since July 2007. 
Though building permits fell 5.0 percent to a 1.10 million-unit rate last month, a six-month low, the weakness is likely to be temporary amid strong confidence levels among homebuilders.
A survey on Monday showed builders' confidence rose to a near 10-year high in October, with builders upbeat about current sales conditions and expectations over the next six months.
Single-family building permits slipped 0.3 percent last month. Multi-family building permits dropped 12.1 percent, with permits for buildings with five units or more falling to their lowest level since December 2014.

Permits for single-family homes in the South rose to their highest level since January 2008.

International Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that growth in output had continued at around the average pace of recent years. Members noted that growth in global trade was subdued, although it had picked up a little recently. They discussed the implications of the general slowdown in trade and industrial production growth, notably in Asia, including for commodity prices. In particular, iron ore prices had declined slightly over September but remained higher than earlier in the year, while oil prices had edged higher from their recent lows. Globally, core inflation had generally remained low and at rates below the targets of most central banks.
In China, indicators of activity for July and August had suggested further moderation in growth. Members noted that growth in fixed asset investment and industrial production had eased over 2015. This had been particularly noticeable in the north-eastern provinces of China where activity was more concentrated in heavy industry and mining. The output of key industrial products, including steel, was lower than in late 2014, partly as a result of weak residential construction activity, even though both residential property prices and sales had been higher than earlier in the year. Members observed that the services sector in China had performed more strongly than the industrial sector in recent quarters.
Recent data on economic activity in Japan had been mixed. Real GDP had declined in the June quarter, while conditions in the labour market had remained tight and nominal wages had continued to increase modestly. Inflation remained low, although the Bank of Japan continued to forecast that it would reach the 2 per cent target by mid 2016. Elsewhere in east Asia, below-average growth appeared to have continued into the second half of 2015 and remained a source of concern for the strength of the global economy. A slowdown in industrial production growth in the region had become increasingly apparent over recent months and exports had declined in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan in August. In India, growth in the June quarter had been driven by robust domestic demand and inflation had remained relatively low in August.
In contrast to the situation in much of Asia, growth in the US economy had picked up to an above-average pace in mid 2015. Recent indicators pointed to further consumption-led strength in the September quarter. Labour market conditions had improved and the unemployment rate had edged lower in August to be close to most estimates of full employment.
In the euro area, timely indicators suggested that the gradual recovery in the economy had continued in the second half of 2015, supported by both external and domestic demand. Unemployment had drifted lower, although the unemployment rate remained high. Inflation remained subdued.
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion of the domestic economy by reviewing the national accounts for the June quarter, which had been released the day after the previous meeting. They noted that, as expected, GDP had increased only slightly following the strong growth recorded in the March quarter. The weakness in the June quarter had reflected temporary, weather-related disruptions to resource exports as well as the ongoing decline in mining investment. Members noted that overall growth was expected to have strengthened in the September quarter, with indications of growth in resource exports and dwelling investment. Members also observed that employment growth had strengthened despite GDP growth over the year having been at the lower end of the forecast range of a year earlier.
Consumption growth had been relatively steady at a below-average pace for the past year, although this was stronger than in 2013. Household income was estimated to have increased by a little less than consumption over the past year, with a modest decline in the household saving ratio. Members noted that the strength of wealth effects on consumption behaviour would affect whether the saving ratio would continue to trend down over the next year or so. While the year-ended growth in retail sales had been little changed in recent months, surveys of households' perceptions of their personal financial situation compared with a year earlier remained above average.
Dwelling investment had increased strongly over the year to June, despite recording a decline in the June quarter. Building approvals had declined a little from their recent peak, but remained at levels that implied further growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a gradually declining rate. Loan approvals for construction of new dwellings had also fallen over the past year. Growth in housing prices in Sydney appeared to have eased slightly in recent months and auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined a little from their recent peaks. However, it was too early to be confident that these signs of slowing in housing price inflation would be sustained.
In relation to lending for housing, members noted that the data on the split of lending to owner-occupiers and investors were of questionable quality at present. The available data suggested that there had been a modest decline in the growth of credit extended to investors in housing of late, which was consistent with the tightening in banks' lending standards in response to actions of the Australian  Prudential  (L:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA). With housing credit growth overall remaining steady over the past year, there had reportedly been a slight pick-up in the growth of housing credit to owner-occupiers.
Mining investment had continued to fall in the June quarter and now accounted for around 5 per cent of nominal GDP, down from a peak of around 8 per cent. Members noted that there had been a correspondingly significant decline in capital imports. In addition, profits of mining firms had fallen sharply over the past year, in line with lower commodity prices. Mining investment was expected to continue to fall over the next couple of years as the current pipeline of work was completed, but resource export volumes, particularly for liquefied natural gas, were expected to increase substantially over the same period.
Non-mining investment was estimated to have picked up a little in the June quarter and had risen modestly over the past year. Over the same period, profits of non-mining companies had kept pace with nominal GDP. Survey measures of business conditions had increased to be further above their long-run averages, notably in the household and business services sectors. Conditions in the goods production and distribution sectors, though weaker than in some other sectors, had also shown improvement of late. Members noted that the depreciation of the exchange rate had led to an increase in exports of services, including tourism, as well as a noticeable decline in imports of services.
Employment growth had strengthened to be 2 per cent over the year to August and the participation rate had increased. The unemployment rate had remained in its 6–6¼ per cent range over recent months. Forward-looking indicators had generally been consistent with the unemployment rate being around its current level or possibly slightly lower in the months ahead. Measures of earnings and productivity growth from the national accounts had remained soft in the June quarter, with negligible growth in either measure over the past year. Overall, unit labour costs had been little changed for around four years, which members saw as helping to explain the stronger-than-expected growth in employment.
Members noted that the improvement in labour demand had been concentrated in the household and business service sectors of the economy. This was consistent with the data on business conditions and output growth by industry. In contrast, employment in goods-related sectors had been little changed for some time. Members discussed the differences in the nature of the investment and employment required in the services sector relative to goods-related industries.
Financial Markets
The discussion of financial markets commenced with the observation that the two major drivers of markets over the past month continued to be concerns about Chinese growth, and the implications for the global economy, as well as the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate in the United States.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left monetary policy unchanged at its September meeting, citing concerns about global growth, a majority of FOMC members had indicated nonetheless that they still expect to start raising the federal funds rate before the end of this year. Market expectations immediately prior to the FOMC meeting implied a one-in-three chance of a rate rise occurring at the September meeting and a very high probability of a rate rise by the end of the year. Following the meeting, however, market expectations changed significantly, with an increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year given only a 50 per cent chance of occurring and markets not fully pricing in a rate rise until April next year at the earliest. Members noted that some market participants did not expect an increase in the policy rate for the foreseeable future.
Bond yields in the major markets had declined in net terms over September. In the United States and Germany, 10-year government bond yields had risen in the first half of the month, mainly in response to some better-than-expected US economic data, before declining following the Fed's decision to leave the federal funds rate unchanged. Yields on Australian Government Securities had moved broadly in line with global yields over the past month.
The changed exchange rate arrangements in China in August had initially led to a depreciation of the renminbi, but the exchange rate had appreciated slightly over the course of September. Members noted that there had been a significant decline in Chinese foreign currency reserves since mid 2014, with apparent sizeable sales or non-reinvestment of maturities of US bonds. Following the depreciation of the renminbi in August, sales of reserves were likely to have continued in response to net private capital outflows. A significant share of private capital outflows over the past year appeared to have been in the form of increased foreign currency bank deposits. The Chinese authorities had announced that existing restrictions on private capital outflows would be more rigorously enforced.
Financial market conditions in a number of emerging market economies had deteriorated further in recent months, reflecting lower commodity prices and country-specific risks, especially for Brazil, Russia and Turkey, where yields on local currency denominated sovereign bonds had increased noticeably. In contrast, developments in some other emerging markets, notably India and Mexico, continued to be relatively benign. Corporate bond issuance in emerging markets in aggregate had fallen sharply in the September quarter. This had been accompanied with significant outflows from both emerging market bond and equity investment funds since the middle of the year. The currencies of some emerging market economies had depreciated further over the past month and some Asian currencies were back to the lows recorded around the time of the financial crisis in the late 1990s.
The US dollar was unchanged on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, while the exchange rates of most other advanced economies had been little changed. The Australian dollar had depreciated marginally to be around its recent lows against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis.
Equity prices had fluctuated around the lower levels reached in late August in many advanced economies as well as in China, with some large daily movements in both directions. News of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) emissions scandal in late September adversely affected European equities, while equity prices in emerging markets had partly recovered from their falls in late August, although they remained lower than at the start of the year. Australian equity prices continued to decline in September, led by the resources sector.
Financial market pricing indicated an expectation that the cash rate would remain unchanged at this meeting.
Financial Stability
Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.
Global financial stability risks had been shifting from advanced country banking systems to China and other emerging market economies. Partly in reaction to this, financial market volatility had picked up following a lengthy period of low volatility and compressed risk premia. Members noted the possibility of a sharp repricing in markets where investors for years had been ‘searching for yield’.
Members noted that domestic sources of risk to financial stability in Australia continued to revolve mainly around developments in local property markets. In the context of recent developments in the housing market and household credit, members discussed the findings from the enhanced scrutiny of housing lending practices undertaken by APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission since the end of 2014. This scrutiny and related work had shown that investor activity was considerably higher – and lending standards in some parts of the market weaker – than had originally been thought.
Members further observed that the risks in commercial property and the property development sector were rising. Building approvals for new apartments remained very strong over 2015, even though rental markets appeared soft in some areas. The divergence between commercial property valuations and rents had widened further, with strong domestic and foreign investor interest for new and existing office buildings in particular, even though vacancy rates were quite high. At the same time, falling commodity prices were weighing on the profitability of many resource-related companies. The rest of the business sector seemed to be in relatively good shape, in contrast, with both gearing and failure rates at relatively low levels.
Members were also briefed on the risks in the New Zealand housing market and dairy sector, given the sizeable exposures of Australian banks through their New Zealand subsidiaries.
While Australian banks continued to perform well, they were taking steps to enhance their resilience. Banks' asset performance continued to improve, profitability remained high, and the large banks had raised substantial amounts of capital in advance of forthcoming prudential requirements. Most banks had strengthened the serviceability metrics used in their mortgage lending and taken steps to slow the pace of growth in investor lending towards the prudential regulator's expectations. Banks were also reportedly becoming increasingly wary of lending to property developers in markets that were thought to be at risk of becoming oversupplied. Nonetheless, competition among lenders had intensified in the owner-occupied segment of the housing market and had continued to do so in parts of the business lending market. Members observed that a key challenge would be to ensure that lending standards at both Australian and foreign-owned banks did not weaken from this point.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Members noted that recent data continued to raise concerns about the outlook for economic growth in China in particular and east Asia more generally, while economic activity in the United States and euro area continued to recover. Below-average growth in the Asian region had been most evident in weak growth in industrial production, which had been mirrored in lower export volumes. While global commodity prices had fallen over the past year, they had been little changed over recent months. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative and low oil prices were expected to continue to provide a measure of support to growth in Australia's major trading partners.
Domestically, the moderate expansion of the economy had continued, although GDP growth in the June quarter was low, in line with expectations, reflecting what appeared to be temporary weakness in resource exports as well as further falls in mining investment. GDP growth had been below average over the past year, but there had been further evidence of rebalancing from the resources sector towards non-mining activity. This rebalancing was being increasingly supported by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, which had led to a noticeable increase in net service exports over the past year.
Members noted that reductions in the cash rate earlier in the year continued to provide support to aggregate demand, particularly dwelling investment and household consumption. Members also noted that conditions in the labour market had strengthened further over recent months and were somewhat better than had been expected earlier in the year. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained in the economy, domestic cost pressures were very low and inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years.
The key domestic sources of risk to financial stability, and stability of the Australian economy more broadly, revolved around developments in local property markets. Members noted that growth in lending for housing had been steady over recent months and that there were some signs of an easing in the strong rate of increase in dwelling prices in Sydney, in particular, although trends had been more varied in a number of other cities. At the same time, members judged that there were signs that the response of the banks to supervisory measures implemented by APRA were helping to manage risks in the housing market. Credit growth overall had been moderate.
Given these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at this meeting. Information about economic and financial developments, both domestically and abroad, would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic growth dipped below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis on Monday, hurt partly by cooling investment, raising pressure on Beijing to further cut interest rates and take other measures to stoke activity.
The world's second-largest economy grew 6.9 percent between July and September from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said, slightly better than forecasts of a 6.8 percent rise but down from 7 percent in the previous three months.
That hardened expectations that China would avoid an abrupt fall-off in growth, with analysts predicting a more gradual slide in activity stretching into 2016.
""Underlying conditions are subdued but stable,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst at Capital Economics in Singapore. ""Stronger fiscal spending and more rapid credit growth will limit the downside risks to growth over the coming quarters.""
Chinese leaders have been trying to reassure jittery global markets for months that the economy is under control after a shock devaluation of the yuan  and a summer stock market plunge fanned fears of a hard landing.
Some analysts were hopeful that the third-quarter cooldown could mark the low point for 2015 as a burst of stimulus measures rolled out by Beijing comes into force in coming months, but muted monthly data for September kept such optimism in check.
""As growth slows and risk of deflation heightens, we reiterate that China needs to cut reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by another 50bps in Q4,"" economists at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients.
""Looming deflation risk suggests that the People's Bank of China will also adjust the benchmark interest rates, especially lending rate, down further.""
In its battle against China's worst economic cooldown in more than six years, the central bank has cut interest rates five times since November and reduced banks' reserve requirement ratios three times this year.
Despite the spate of easing, Monday's GDP reading was still the worst since the first quarter of 2009, when growth tumbled to 6.2 percent.
POLICY SUPPORT
While Chinese officials put a brave face on China's economic woes, describing the slowdown as being ""reasonable"", senior leaders have occasionally voiced worries.
President Xi Jinping told Reuters in an interview over the weekend that the government has concerns about the economy and was working hard to address them.
Policymakers think they can stem a rapid rundown of the country's foreign exchange reserves and ease pressure on the currency by pump-priming the economy to meet this year's growth target of about 7 percent, sources involved in policy discussions say.
But key parts of the economy are still losing steam.
Factory output in September rose 5.7 percent from a year ago, missing forecasts for a 6 percent rise, and fixed-asset investment (FAI) climbed 10.3 percent in the first nine months, below estimates of 10.8 percent.
September retail spending alone bucked the trend, growing at an annual rate of 10.9 percent, slightly beating forecasts for 10.8 percent.
""The overall downturn pressure on the Chinese economy is still huge,"" said Zhou Hao, a senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, who expects government will lower the annual growth target in its next five-year plan at the end of this month.
The latest Reuters quarterly poll showed economists expect the central bank will cut interest rates by another 25 basis points (bps) and lower the amount banks must hold as reserves by 50 bps by year-end. 
The same poll predicted economic growth of 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, easing to 6.7 percent in the first of 2016.
China's consumer inflation cooled more than expected in September, while producer prices extended their slide to a 43rd straight month, highlighting the urgency for the central bank to tackle deflationary pressures.
To shore up growth, the government has quickened spending on infrastructure and eased curbs on the ailing property sector. The latter have helped revive weak home sales and prices but have not yet reversed a sharp decline in new construction.
Data released separately on Monday showed China's government spending surged almost 27 percent in September from a year ago.
Some market watchers believe current growth is much weaker than government figures, though officials deny allegations that the numbers are inflated.
Despite weak exports and imports, factory overcapacity and a cooling property market, Beijing reported annual economic growth of 7.0 percent in the first two quarters, in line with its full-year target.

However, some economists think the statistics may be underestimating strong consumption and service sector growth, putting too much weight on the cyclical and structural weaknesses in manufacturing.

1403,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 19, 2015 02:01AM ET</span>",China GDP Growth Slows To 6.9%,"By Duncan Hewitt -

SHANGHAI -- China’s economic growth slowed to 6.9 percent in the third quarter of the year, down from 7 percent in the first two quarters. The figure is the country’s slowest growth rate since the global financial crisis of 2009, and analysts said it emphasizes the challenges facing the world’s second largest economy, which has been hit by an export slowdown and falls in its stock markets.
China’s total GDP for the first three quarters was 48.78 trillion yuan ($7.68 trillion), according to the country’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 6.9 percent growth rate was slightly better than the 6.8 percent predicted by many economists – and the NBS described it as evidence of steady growth.
But it marks a sharp decline from last year’s 7.3 percent growth, and appears to back Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s acknowledgment this weekend that it was “not easy” for the country to reach its target for the year of “about seven percent.”

Slowing global demand has played a part in a slump in exports, which were down 8.3 percent, 5.5 percent and 3.7 percent respectively, in dollar terms, over the past three months. The dramatic end of a year-long boom on China’s stock markets -- which have plunged some 30 percent over the past 4 months -- has also shaken business confidence. These factors have led to a decline in investment by businesses and falls in consumer confidence, which have contributed to a massive slowdown in China’s imports: these were down 20.4 percent year-on-year in September
The NBS said that China’s industrial output grew 6.2 percent in the first three quarters (though this figure also slowed to 5.7 percent in September). Property investment, a key engine of China’s growth that has cooled significantly in recent years, also grew slowly, at 2.6 percent.
The main bright spots, analysts said, were growth in the service sector -- which was up more than 11 percent -- and in retail, which expanded by 10.9 percent year-on-year in September, up from 10.8 percent in August. Rural retail growth, seen as a potential growth area of domestic consumption, outstripped that of urban areas, while online sales continue to expand, and now account for 12 percent of China’s total retail sales.
 However, China's consumer price index has remained low, with many producers cutting prices to maintain sales, in signs of continuing anxiety.
Premier Li said at the weekend that “continued strength in the labor market and services” were positive signs for China's economy, adding that as long as such factors persisted, “GDP [growth] a little higher or lower than 7 percent is acceptable.”
However President Xi Jinping acknowledged in an interview with Reuters on Saturday that there were “concerns about the Chinese economy.” And evidence that some sectors are being hurt by the slowdown has come with the sudden closure of a number of factories in labor-intensive manufacturing areas such as southern Guangdong province in recent weeks.
And debate also remains about the reliability of China’s economic data, though the authorities have recently adopted International Monetary Fund standards in an attempt to increase credibility of China's statistics.

What is clear is that the authorities are seeking to address the slowdown with an increase in infrastructure investment. Fixed-asset investment for the first three quarters was up 10.3 percent, with further increases predicted. China’s economic planners are stepping up spending on key sectors like railways, as they did during the global financial crisis in 2009, though officials have pledged to be more cautious in how they invest money this time around, and are seeking to attract more private investment for infrastructure projects.
A senior government official said over the weekend that “keeping relatively high growth of infrastructure investment is key to stabilizing economic growth.” Yu Bin, of the Development Research Center of China’s State Council or cabinet, said the country should speed up investment in hydropower, rural roads and improving agricultural land, and called for lowering the cost of financing for companies.
And a key meeting of China’s government to set economic policy for the next five years next week is expected to approve further infrastructure spending -- though some debate on the wisdom of such an approach remains. Zhu Yunlai, former head of the China International Capital Corporation, and son of former Premier Zhu Rongji, recently criticized plans to boost the economy through investment, saying many such projects were “inefficient” in market terms, the South China Morning Post reported.

Still some economists predict a gradual rebound in China's growth rate, as stimulus measures take effect. The government recently reduced the down-payment requirement for first-time home buyers, for example, while Li-gang Liu, chief China economist at ANZ Bank, said in a research note sent to International Business Times that new loans were above expectations in the third quarter. He predicted that China's slowdown “will soon bottom out.”
However he and other analysts also predict that further rate cuts will be required, as the government seeks to boost the economy. China has already cut interest rates five times over the past year, and has reduced the reserve requirement ratio for banks, though ANZ's Liu said this was still high.
President Xi also pledged in his Reuters interview that China would continue to open up to foreign investment in the near future. However some observers say a need to maintain rapid growth may delay the implementation of further market-oriented reforms, something many foreign investors and analysts have called for."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israel's economy is on track to grow 2.5 percent in 2015, slightly lower than a 2.6 percent pace last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Sunday. Citing seven to nine months of data, the bureau said the economy this year was boosted by higher private spending. Although a fall in investment in fixed assets was less than in 2014, the economy was hit by a decline in exports compared with an advance the previous year.
In its third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, the bureau left unchanged its growth estimate of an annualized 0.1 percent, but it revised first-quarter GDP growth to an annualized 2.0 percent from 1.8 percent.
The Bank of Israel last month cut its 2015 growth estimate to 2.6 percent from 3.0 percent, while the Finance Ministry lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent. They expect growth of between 3.3 and 3.7 percent in 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded strongly in early October, suggesting that the economic recovery remained on track despite headwinds from a strong dollar and weak global demand that have weighed on the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing.
The snapback in sentiment reported on Friday underscored robust domestic demand and offered hope that consumer spending would remain solid enough to support economic growth, which has slowed significantly in recent months.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 92.1 in early October from a reading of 87.2 September. The survey's current conditions sub-index shot up to 106.7 this month from 101.2 in September.
The index at current levels has historically been consistent with roughly a 4 percent annualized rate of consumer spending growth, according to economists.
""This suggests that U.S. household sentiment has turned an important corner, and is a hopeful sign on the outlook for consumer spending activity going forward, given signs of weakness in other parts of the economy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The rise in sentiment, which likely reflected cheaper gasoline prices, suggested limited impact from recent stock market volatility. Consumers were the most optimistic about their personal financial expectations since 2007.
Their views toward purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods were equally bullish.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and has been the bright spot in the economy as the industrial sector wobbles under the onslaught of slowing global growth and the resurgent dollar, which have eroded demand for U.S. manufactured goods.
It is also being weighed down by lower energy oil prices that have undercut capital investment in the energy sector, as well as an effort by businesses to whittle down their inventories.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on Friday, while prices were U.S. Treasuries were mostly weaker. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial output slipped 0.2 percent on renewed weakness in oil and gas drilling after dipping 0.1 percent in August. Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter.
""We do not expect the recent slowing to lead to a broader pullback in aggregate growth, as service sector activity remains solid,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (L:BARC) in New York.
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Still, the weak industrial production report added to soft trade, retail sales and employment data that have pointed to a significant slowdown in growth after the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the second quarter.
Third-quarter growth estimates are currently around a 1.5 percent rate. Slower growth and low inflation have diminished expectations of an interest rate hike from the Fed this year.
Manufacturing output fell 0.1 percent in September even though robust demand for automobiles lifted motor vehicle and parts production by 0.2 percent. Manufacturing output dropped by 0.4 percent in August. For the third quarter, manufacturing output increased at a rate of 2.5 percent.
There were declines in the production of computer and electronic products, as well as electronic equipment, appliances and components. Primary metals and machinery output increased.
Mining production fell 2.0 percent as oil and gas well drilling tumbled 4.0 percent after increasing for two straight months. An almost 60 percent plunge in oil prices since June 2014 has hurt the profits of oil-field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) , leading to deep cuts in their capital spending budgets.
Utilities production increased 1.3 percent in September. With output declining, industrial capacity use fell to 77.5 percent from 77.8 percent in August. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.

The lackluster industrial production picture was reflected in a swathe of manufacturers' results on Friday, with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) reporting dips in revenue along with profits that were better than forecast.

""The focus of global financial stability has been shifting to emerging-market economies and their potential to contribute to destabilizing adjustments in financial markets,"" the RBA said. The growth outlook for China and other emerging-market economies has deteriorated.

The 2015 deficit fell to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest since 2007 and less than the average of the last 40 years. Last year's deficit was $483 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 2.8 percent. Accounting for calendar adjustments, the 2015 fiscal year deficit was $445 billion.
Fiscal 2015 revenues grew 8 percent to $3.249 trillion, while outlays rose 5 percent to $3.688 trillion.
The shrinking deficit is a marked change from the $1 trillion-plus annual deficits the U.S. government reported from fiscal 2009-2012 when it ramped up spending to deal with the effects of the financial crisis.
Congressional leaders and the White House have been holding closed-door talks on reaching a two-year budget deal. They face a Dec 11. deadline, when current funding for federal agencies expire.
Republicans want the budget negotiations to eliminate strict budget caps on defense programs, while Democrats want to kill the caps for defense and other domestic programs.
Congress also faces an impending debt ceiling deadline. The Treasury said earlier on Thursday that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing capacity no later than Nov. 3, two days earlier than its previous estimate.
Raising the debt limit is a controversial issue for conservative Republicans. They want to extract deep reductions in domestic spending over the long term before allowing an increase in government borrowing.
For September, the Treasury recorded a budget surplus of $91 billion, down from a $106 billion surplus a year ago. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a $95 billion surplus for last month.
Receipts in September totaled $365 billion, up 4 percent from the same month in 2014, while outlays were up 12 percent to$274 billion.
A Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters that receipts last month were dampened by a difference in the composition of business days.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast a $414 billion deficit for fiscal 2016, and continues to warn that increasing federal debt levels are unsustainable over the long term.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest drop in eight months in September as the cost of gasoline fell, but a steady pick-up in the prices of other goods and services suggested inflation was poised to rise.
There was good news on the labor market, with other data on Thursday showing new applications for unemployment aid fell back to a 42-year low last week. The very low level of layoffs and gradually firming underlying inflation could keep the door open to an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year. 
""Today's reports strengthen our view that the U.S. economy remains on the right track and should help to bolster the Fed's confidence that it is getting ever closer to meeting both of its mandates. We expect the first rate hike in December,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the CPI was unchanged for the first time in four months. It rose 0.2 percent in August.
Stripping out food and energy costs, prices rose last month. The so-called core CPI gained 0.2 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.9 percent, the largest gain since July 2014, after advancing 1.8 percent in August. 
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, which is lower than the core CPI. Low inflation, which has persistently run below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target, is a major hurdle to an interest rate hike this year.
Stocks on Wall Street rose on the data, snapping a two-day losing streak. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
DIVIDED FED 
Top Fed officials are divided on whether to tighten monetary policy, with governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo this week urging against raising interest rates. In contrast, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer have recently said they support raising rates this year. 
Expectations of a lift-off in the U.S. central bank's short-term interest rate have been dealt a blow by an abrupt slowdown in job growth in the last two months and softening economic activity because of a strong dollar, lower oil prices and a weakening global economy. 
The stumble in job growth, however, is at odds with the very low levels of layoffs. In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000 for the week ended Oct. 10.
Claims were last at this level in July, which was the lowest since November 1973. Nonfarm payrolls growth in August and September averaged 139,000, the weakest two-month rise since January last year. 
The slowdown is puzzling given job openings are at record highs. Some economists say the step-down in hiring is because employers cannot find qualified workers for the open jobs. 
""Claims continue to show no sign of an uptrend, reinforcing our view that the sudden slowing in payrolls in the last two months mainly reflects volatility rather than a fundamental change in the trend,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since December 1973.
The inflation report showed gasoline prices fell 9.0 percent, the biggest drop since January, after declining 4.1 percent in August. 
Food prices increased 0.4 percent, the largest increase since May 2014, and rents increased 0.4 percent. Expensive food and accommodation could hurt consumer spending, even with cheaper gasoline.
The cost of medical care, household furnishings and personal care products increased last month. However, apparel prices fell as did the cost of new vehicles and used cars and trucks. Airline fares also declined. 
While the inflation and jobless claims data allayed some of the concerns about the economy, manufacturing remains a weak spot. Separate reports showed factory activity in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region contracted further in October.

""We did not anticipate manufacturing to be a driver of growth in 2015, given the strengthening in the dollar, and turmoil in emerging markets may be adding to weakness,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales barely rose in September and producer prices recorded their biggest decline in eight months, raising further doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
The weak reports on Wednesday were the latest suggestion that the economy was losing momentum in the face of slowing global growth, a strong dollar, an inventory correction and lower oil prices that are hampering capital spending in the energy sector. Job growth braked sharply in the past two months.
""The softness of September's figures supports our view that the Fed probably isn't going to hike interest rates until early next year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month largely as cheaper gasoline pushed service station receipts down 3.2 percent. Giving the report a weak tone, sales in August were revised down to show them unchanged instead of rising 0.2 percent. 
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in August. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously said to have advanced 0.4 percent in August.
Last month's weak core sales and the downward revision to August's figure, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories were again unchanged in August, prompted JPMorgan (N:JPM) to cut its third-quarter GDP estimate by half a percentage point to an annual rate of 1 percent.
The economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. Some economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the soft retail sales report, noting discretionary spending remained fairly healthy.
Consumers boosted their purchases of automobiles and furniture and spent more on hobbies, clothing and eating out. That points to underlying strength in domestic demand which should provide some cushion against softening global growth.
CONSUMER SPENDING STILL STRONG 
""The overall message is that consumer spending has remained extremely strong. If sentiment had indeed shifted, it would be hard to explain why sales of cars, certainly among the more expensive items, jumped in September to their highest level since July 2005,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
Sales of electronic goods were soft despite the launch of Apple's (O:AAPL) latest iPhone. Some economists said they expected the boost from the iPhone in October.
A report from the Fed showed the economy was expanding modestly from mid-August through early October. It described consumer spending as growing ""moderately"" during the same period and noted the strong dollar was hurting manufacturing. 
Stocks on Wall Street fell after Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) warned its full-year sales would be flat because of dollar strength. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose, while the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index fell 0.5 percent in September, the largest drop since January, after being unchanged in August. 
In the 12 months through September, the PPI fell 1.1 percent after declining 0.8 percent in August. It was the eighth straight 12-month decrease in the index.
The weak inflation environment is one of the obstacles confronting Fed policymakers who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008.
""It is the uncertain course of inflation that could keep the Fed from hiking rates this year. Unfortunately, the gang that cannot communicate straight is still sending out as many unclear signals as possible,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Top Fed officials are divided on whether to tighten monetary policy, with Governor Daniel Tarullo saying on Tuesday the central bank should not hike rates this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer have recently said they support raising rates this year.

There's room for some cautious optimism for American workers at smaller companies: A net 16 percent of managers said they were planning to increase wages last month, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. That accounts for a three-point gain from August and the second-highest response since 2007.
The results come from 656 responses to a National Federation of Independent Business survey. At the same time, the group found that 67 percent of small business owners have rated the business climate in the U.S. as fair or poor and 63 percent think the U.S. is on the wrong path. When it comes to taxes, 67 percent of businesses owners think they pay too much.
“Every candidate for every office will talk about small business for the next 13 months. The real question is whether they’re listening to small business,” said Holly Wade, the research director for the National Federation of Independent Business in a press release. The Federation counts approximately 325,000 small and independent businesses as members.
Approximately 23 percent of small companies in the U.S. said in September that they had increased their compensation for workers. At the same time, the number of business owners who said they had increased pay for workers did not rise from the amount reported in August.
The National Federation of Independent Business’ small business optimism index rose slightly in September to 96.1 from 95.9, however it still remains below the average of 98. Plans to increase employment were down 1 percent in September, according to the survey.
“Small business optimism continues to be stagnant, which is consistent with the expected economic growth of about 2.5 percent,” said the Federation’s chief economist Bill Dunkelberg. “The percent of owners citing the difficulty of finding qualified workers as their Most Important Business Problem increased and is now third on the list behind taxes and regulations.”
The uncertain news over wage growth for small businesses comes after the U.S. economy created 142,000 jobs in September, a slowdown for the second month in a row.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2015 04:03AM ET</span>","China economic picture remains cloudy as September export fall eases, imports slump","By Xiaoyi Shao and Pete Sweeney
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's exports fell less than expected in September, with monthly figures showing recovery, but a sharper fall in imports left economists divided over whether the country's ailing trade sector is showing signs of turning around.
On the surface, the trade data on Tuesday reinforced views that the world's second-largest economy is still slowly losing momentum, putting more pressure on Beijing to roll out further stimulus measures and keeping global markets on edge.
But the numbers did not suggest a greater risk of a hard landing, either, as some investors have feared. 
Exports fell 3.7 percent from the same period last year, less than a 6.3 percent drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and moderating from a 5.5 percent decline in August. 
However, imports by value tumbled for the 11th straight month, losing over 20 percent year-on-year in September due to weak commodity prices and soft domestic demand, which will continue to complicate Beijing's efforts to stave off deflation.
Economists had expected a 15.0 percent drop, after a 13.8 percent decline in the previous month.
Highlighting persistent weakness in demand at home and abroad, China's combined exports and imports fell 8.1 percent in the first nine months of the year from the same period in 2014, well below the full-year official target of 6 percent growth.
That will likely reinforce expectations that Beijing will cut interest rates again in coming months and announce other measures to avert a sharper economic slowdown. 
""In general, there are no green shoots in this set of data,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. 
""The growth of port throughput volume still remains low.""
However, monthly figures were more rosy.
China's exports to every major market except Taiwan rose from August, as did imports, and some economists were inclined to give that more weight than year-on-year changes. For a table on trade with major markets, see.
Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics warned that annual export readings may be distorted downward by comparisons with strong export performance at the end of 2014, which many suspected was inflated by yuan speculation disguised as trade.
He suggested paying closer attention to monthly trends, which show a steady rise to most major export markets in the U.S. and Europe over the summer.
""Basically, exports have been doing better since the second quarter, but that recovery trend has been masked on a year-on-year basis because the second half of 2014 was so strong.""
Evans-Pritchard also said that import data had become unreliable given massive swings in prices due to the commodity downturn and a divergence between prices and trading volumes.
""For the major commodities like oil, copper, etc. we're actually seeing a pretty healthy trend in import volumes."" 
Indeed, China's imports of copper, iron ore, crude oil and coal all rose in September from August, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.
Still, import volumes are a leading indicator for exports in China, given a large share of materials and parts are re-exported as finished goods, keeping the outlook cloudy.
""September's import figure does not bode well for industrial production and fixed asset investment,"" ANZ economists wrote in a research note. 
""Overall growth momentum last month remained weak and third-quarter GDP growth to be released next Monday (Oct. 19) will likely have edged down to 6.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with 7 percent in the first half."" 
Growth below 7 percent would be the weakest since the global financial crisis.
China posted a trade surplus of $60.34 billion for September, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday, higher than forecasts for $46.8 billion and up slightly from $60.24 billion in August.
While the surplus is largely due to weak imports, it does help ease pressure on the country's money supply from capital outflows, ANZ argued. 
SLOWDOWN FEARS
China is widely expected to post its slowest economic growth in a quarter of a century this year amid weak demand, factory overcapacity, high debt levels and cooling investment, but there are doubts over whether Beijing can do much about it.
Repeated monetary easing and fiscal stimulus over the past year have yet to revive growth as debt-laden companies are in no mood to expand as the economy cools. Beijing is also reluctant to prop up exporters at the low end of the value chain.
""I really don't think there's much the government can do policy-wise to boost exports in the short run – it primarily reflects external weakness,"" said Paul Tang, chief economist at the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong. ""They can do things to help boost competitiveness, but everything there is long term.""
In fact, developed economies are to blame for the global economic malaise because their slow recoveries were not creating enough demand, China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei was quoted as saying over the weekend. 
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said last week that the world could get stuck in a muddle of mediocre growth unless policymakers take economic reforms more seriously. 
""The latest snapshot of the global economy looks uneasily familiar: a brittle, uneven recovery, with slower-than-expected growth and increasing downside risks,"" Lagarde said.
China's leaders will signal later this month that growth is their priority over reforms by setting a growth target of around 7 percent in their next long-term plan even as the economy loses momentum, policy insiders told Reuters.

Many members stuck to the board's collective outlook that 2% inflation can be anchored around the six month period to September next year but repeated the warning by the governor that the time frame may be delayed again by the recent drop in energy costs.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2015 02:30PM ET</span>",Brazil's 'new middle class' struggles as economy plunges,"By Asher Levine
SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil (Reuters) - Until recently, Lucinelia de Jesus Souza's future seemed bright, running a small coffee shop that caters to factory workers and other blue-collar customers in this industrial suburb of São Paulo. 
But the faded pink counters of her shoebox-sized business, which opened a decade ago and blossomed as Brazil's economy grew quickly, now see fewer customers stopping in for coffee or deep-fried pastries.
Her income has fallen by half since 2012, forcing the 43-year-old to cut the sort of spending that once heralded an emerging new consumer class in Latin America's biggest country.
With the economy in recession and her husband's job at an auto-parts factory uncertain because of growing cutbacks among local carmakers, trips to the mall for name-brand clothes are on hold, along with plans to buy home appliances. 
Gone too is Sunday lunch out with her family, a recent but cherished tradition.
""It was false growth,"" says Souza, summing up the outlook of many who feel let down by a lost promise. ""People here are losing their jobs, they are fed up.""
After a commodities-fueled boom that allowed Brazil to finance ambitious poverty-reduction programs and peaked with economic growth of 7.5 percent in 2010, Brazil is in its worst recession in nearly three decades. 
During the boom years, tens of millions of Brazilians escaped poverty and became known as ""the new middle class."" Their ability to buy items like cars and flat-screen TVs for the first time further fueled economic growth.
Now, they are struggling to hold on to hard-won gains and are rethinking everything from spending habits to political loyalties.
""How bright is the future going to be?"" asks Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper, a São Paulo business school. ""Everyone is hoping for some kind of change, but no one knows what that looks like or how it is going to happen.""
A decade ago, it seemed everyone knew.
    At the time, Brazil's left-wing ruling Workers' Party, leveraging soaring export and tax revenue, broadened generous social programs and opened the taps on credit, helping launch millions into what seemed an ascendant future.
Compared with prior booms, the expansion was notable because it reached across the continent-sized country, from São Paulo and other major cities to emerging new towns in the Amazon (O:AMZN) rainforest to historically poor hamlets in Brazil's northeast. 
Brazil became a model of development for the rest of Latin America and beyond.
But these days, Brazilians are questioning it all.
'WHERE DID IT LEAD US?' 
Unemployment is on the rise and inflation, running at an annual rate of 9.5 percent, is eroding purchasing power.
In São Bernardo do Campo, the cradle of Brazil's auto industry, factories are downsizing. Over 12,000 jobs, equal to nearly 5 percent of the local workforce, disappeared between January and August, according to labor ministry data. 
Combined with a massive corruption scandal at oil firm Petrobras and other state-run companies, the downturn has hammered the popularity of President Dilma Rousseff. Her single-digit approval ratings are the lowest of any Brazilian leader in decades.
It is even tarnishing the once-sterling legacy of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Rousseff's mentor and predecessor, who cut his political teeth as a São Bernardo do Campo union leader. As president during the boom, Lula introduced the easy credit that many Brazilian consumers binged on until the economy collapsed. 
""Lula taught us to spend, but where did it lead us?"" asks Souza, the coffee shop owner.
Born one of eight children to illiterate parents in Brazil's northeast, she migrated with her family to Sao Paulo's industrial belt in the mid-1970s. She left school at 16 and worked in a dairy plant to help keep food on the table of the family's three-room shack.
She later earned her high-school diploma and used severance pay from another factory job to start her coffee shop. Soon she was earning about 5,000 reais a month ($1,300). She and her husband bought their first new car, an Internet connection at home and her first bottle of French perfume.
""Everything feels so uncertain now,"" she says. ""I'm looking harder for sales at the supermarket and avoiding anything that isn't totally essential.""
Other locals are scrambling to get by.
    Maria Olinda Longuini, who runs an employment agency in Sao Bernardo, has seen a spike in applications. ""The husband loses his job in the factory so the wife or some other family member will come in,"" she says. 
CHANGED EXPECTATIONS
As with the boom, the recession is playing out nationwide. 
Many of the previous decade's gains came for the new middle class, people who in more developed economies would be known as working poor - workers with a household income of between about $600 and $1,000 per month.
Although paltry compared with salaries in richer countries, it changed their long-term expectations.
Parents began enrolling their children in modest private schools and health plans. With many paying taxes for the first time, their demands for better government services and an end to corruption grew louder.
""These are not the same people they once were,"" says Mauricio Prado, a partner with consulting firm Plano CDE, which tracks the behavior of lower-income Brazilians. ""They are better-educated, healthier, transformed.""
    The transformation was especially welcome in the northeast, a region so destitute that once it was best known for the millions of families, like Souza's, that moved southward in search of prosperity. 
""We would go hungry, we would suffer,"" recalls Edison Gomes Bastos, the manager of a small home furnishing store outside Salvador, the region's largest city. Compared to his childhood, the 33-year-old father of two says ""life is a thousand times better now.""
But the local economy, where wages and economic growth outpaced the national average during the boom, is now shrinking.
Since the start of 2012, real wages across metropolitan Salvador have contracted 8.5 percent. Unemployment has spiked to 12.4 percent, well over the national rate of 7.6 percent.
With a wary eye on the future, Bastos says he will do whatever it takes to ensure his kids don't face the same hardships he did: ""I'll sell my car, I'll cut everything, but one thing I will always pay for is a good education for my children so they can continue to grow.""
Nearby, Edinaldo Souza Santos, a 31-year-old vegetable vendor, says that despite the improvements over the past decade, life still ""is not what I want it to be.""
""Something needs to change,"" he warns, ""or it's all going down the drain.""

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2015 12:18PM ET</span>",U.S. import prices point to smaller drag on inflation,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell only slightly in September, offset by recovering oil prices, suggesting a slowdown in the rate of imported deflation is occurring which may eventually allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The Fed held off from raising interest rates in September largely because a weak global economy and financial market volatility had raised doubts that U.S. inflation would rise toward the Fed's target of 2.0 percent as expected.
U.S. import prices fell only 0.1 percent last month in data reported by the Labor Department on Friday, and import prices, excluding oil, fell 0.2 percent, which was half the pace of the declines registered in July and August.
Analysts had expected overall import prices to decline more, by 0.5 percent, and the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against a basket of currency following the data's release. U.S. stock prices were little changed.
""Today's report suggests a significant slowing in the rate of imported deflation,"" said Blerina Uruçi, an analyst at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC).
A surge in value of the U.S. dollar last year, fueled by expectations that a strengthening U.S. economy would lead to higher interest rates, has been a factor pushing down inflation, as evidenced by declines in non-oil import prices.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who said late last month the Fed was likely to raise rates by year end, has argued that the disinflationary impact from imports was bound to fade and that U.S. inflation would then trend higher. Friday's data appeared consistent with that view.
Already, declines in oil prices have moderated after a late 2014 plunge, and prices for imported oil rose 1.1 percent in September after declining sharply in August.
Crude oil prices have actually trended higher over the last month. The dollar, which strengthened sharply in the second half of 2014, has weakened since March.
The Labor Department data also showed the price of imported consumer goods other than cars actually rose 0.1 percent in September, the first gain since February. Imported car prices were flat.
Still, the data also pointed to ongoing weakness in global demand that is weighing heavily on U.S. factories and other exporters. Export prices fell 0.7 percent, more than the 0.2 percent decline forecast by economists.

A separate report from the Commerce Department showed a rise in wholesale inventories that could point to unwanted inventory build-up, which could weigh on manufacturing and economic growth.
"
1474,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2015 10:09AM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories rise slightly in August,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories rose in August, boosted by larger stocks of computers and professional equipment used by businesses.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories increased 0.1 percent, outpacing the median forecast of a flat reading in a Reuters poll.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos -rose 0.1 percent.
Inventories for durable goods climbed 0.3 percent, with computers up 1.9 percent. At August's sales pace it would take 1.31 months to clear shelves, up slightly from 1.30 months in July.
An inventory-to-sales ratio that high usually means an unwanted inventory build-up, which would require businesses to liquidate stocks. That in turn could weigh on manufacturing and economic growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell more than expected to near a 42-year low last week, pointing to ongoing tightening in the labor market despite the recent slowdown in hiring.
The data released on Thursday provides an upbeat check on the health of the labor market after last week's monthly employment report increased doubts the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by the end of this year.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 for the week ended Oct. 3, the Labor Department said.
That was the lowest since mid-July when the number of claims was at its lowest since 1973. Hitting such a historical low is remarkable considering the U.S. workforce has grown considerably since the 1970s.
It was also the 31st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market. The Labor Department said there were no special factors impacting last week's claims.
Claims for the prior week were revised lower by 1,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a more modest decline in claims to 274,000 last week.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 3,000 to 267,500.
U.S. Treasury yields were little changed following publication of the data, and U.S. stock futures continued their declines.
While businesses appear to have little reason to let workers go these days, in recent months they have not shown much gusto in adding new hires. U.S. employers added just 142,000 jobs to their payrolls in September and 136,000 in August, which was well below the averages in prior months of about 200,000 new jobs added every month.
The slowdown in hiring has boosted expectations the Fed will wait until early next year to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose by 9,000 to 2.20 million in the week ended Sept. 26.

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held off on expanding its stimulus package Wednesday, despite growing signs of recession in the country’s economy. Japan, hit by a slowdown in China, is said to be in technical recession and core consumer prices in August witnessed their first annual drop since the central bank deployed its massive stimulus program over two years ago.
In a widely expected move, the central bank maintained its pledge to increase the purchase of Japanese government bonds at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. Following the announcement, Japanese stocks fell 0.7 percent before recovering in afternoon trade to trade up 0.72 percent.
“Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, although exports and production have been affected by the slowdown in emerging economies,” the bank said, in a statement released Wednesday. “Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.”
In 2013, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced a massive $1.4 trillion quantitative easing program in a bid to restore the economy to health and end years of deflation. At the time Kuroda described the move as “monetary easing in an entirely new dimension.”
While the expansive monetary policy has pushed the Japanese currency down 22 percent since April 2013, deflation fears have continued to plague Japan.
According to data released last month, the core consumer price index declined 0.1 percent in August from a year ago -- its first drop since April 2013 -- raising doubts over the government’s ambitious 2 percent inflation target.
The data led many to speculate that the Bank of Japan might announce an increase in its pace of easing on Oct. 30, when it will provide an update on its outlook for inflation and economic growth.
“It would’ve been a surprise if the BOJ had changed its policy today,” Hideo Kumano, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute and former central bank official, told Bloomberg. “Taking action at the next gathering won’t be a surprise and the focus will be on how they do this.”
The focus now turns to a news conference later in the day, when Kuroda is expected to explain the policy decision."

The BoJ's asset purchase target is ¥80 trillion annually with board member Takahide Kiuchi dissenting again on the amount after suggesting earlier this year a level around ¥45 trillion.
There has been speculation the BoJ may be considering further easing, though the board has contended thta underlying inflation is rising and a slump in factory output is not serious enough to derail the path to a modest economic recovery and 2% inflation.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2015 11:21AM ET</span>","U.S. trade deficit widens as exports sag, imports from China surge","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. exports took a hit from an ailing global economy in August and imports from China surged, fueling the largest expansion of America's trade deficit in five months.
The data released on Tuesday by the Commerce Department illustrates the U.S. economy's vulnerabilities to a strong dollar and weak demand in foreign markets, which could impose further caution on the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates.
The trade deficit swelled by 15.6 percent to $48.3 billion in August, according to data that is adjusted for seasonal factors. 
The scope of the increase was accentuated by the unusually narrow trade deficit registered in July. Also, imports likely got a temporary boost from inflows of cellphones ahead of the release of Apple's new iPhone model. 
But the size of the trade gap has risen far above the average levels seen in recent years and the onus for stronger U.S. economic growth is now falling squarely on consumers.
""Trade will remain a drag on the real economy until well into next year,"" said Steve Murphy, an economist at Capital Economics.
Sales of U.S. goods and services abroad fell 2 percent to their lowest level since October 2012. Exports to Mexico fell by $1.5 billion in August and the European Union bought $500 million less from America than it did in July, according to data on bilateral trade which is not seasonally adjusted.
The declines are partly due to expectations of higher interest rates in the United States that have pushed the value of the dollar higher, reflecting the strength of America's economy relative to its trading partners. A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad.
Weaker demand abroad is also playing a role, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will ask policymakers from other countries gathering in Lima, Peru this week to stimulate their economies to kick-start global growth.
The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for the second time this year on Tuesday, citing weak commodity prices and a slowdown in China while warning that policies aimed at increasing demand were needed.
A 3 percent increase in U.S. imports from China also factored into the widening of the trade deficit. China's yuan currency has depreciated sharply in recent months amid concerns of a possible crash in the Chinese economy, which is the second largest in the world after America's. 
The widening of the U.S. trade deficit surpassed the $47.4 billion median forecast for the deficit in a Reuters poll of economists.
Yields on U.S. government debt initially declined after the report was released, before later turning higher as U.S. stock prices were little changed.
Until recently it appeared that the U.S. economy was largely shrugging off weakness abroad. But last week new data showed a sharp slowdown in employment growth in August and September. This has fueled doubts on Wall Street over Fed Chair Janet Yellen's assertion two weeks ago that the economy would be strong enough to warrant an interest rate hike this year.
Trades made in futures markets now imply that investors are betting the Fed will hold off on hikes until at least March.
In August, imports rose 1.2 percent, even though America bought the least petroleum from abroad since September 2004.

Imports of consumer goods rose by $4 billion, of which slightly more than half the rise was due to increased purchases of cell phones and other household goods.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday for a fifth straight month in a widely expected move and offered no clues to indicate it may change its steady stance any time soon.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept the cash rate at a record low 2.0 percent, where it has been since the last cut in May.
In a brief statement that was almost identical to the September note, the RBA reiterated that it would look to upcoming data to judge if the current policy setting needed to be adjusted.
""The available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues,"" the RBA said.
""Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet, with domestic inflationary pressures contained.""
Given this backdrop, the RBA said monetary policy needed to be accommodative, a view it has repeated in previous meetings.
The decision and an absence of any expressed anxiety about slowing growth in China, Australia's single biggest export market, gave the currency a bit of a boost.
The Aussie dollar <AUD=D4> popped above 71 U.S. cents for the first time in two weeks, pulling further away from a 6-1/2 year low of $0.6892 set last month.
The RBA again said the currency was adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
""We have the RBA on hold from here,"" said Tom Kennedy, economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""It will come down to what happens in places like China and Japan and how their economies play out in next two to three quarters.""
Indeed, the health of Australia's key trading partners like China is seen as a major risk for an economy that is struggling with a prolonged downturn in mining investments.
Falling prices for major commodity exports are already hitting company profits, national income and government tax revenues, eating into nominal GDP growth.
Data earlier in the day showed Australia's trade position worsened unexpectedly in August, extending a string of deficits stretching back to April 2014.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the trade deficit grew to A$3.1 billion ($2.2 billion), from an upwardly revised A$2.8 billion the previous month.
The deterioration was partly driven by weakness in export values, a feature that is likely to persist as long as commodity prices stay under pressure.

1516,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 06, 2015 12:04AM ET</span>","RBA holds cash rate steady at 2% as expected, notes Asia slowdown","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia, as expected, held its cash rate at a record low 2% on Tuesday, while noting softer conditions in China and other Asian countries are a key factor on future policy views.
Below is the full-text statement:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in China and east Asia of late, but stronger US growth. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Equity market volatility has continued, but the functioning of financial markets generally has not, to date, been impaired. Long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. Overall, global financial conditions remain very accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues. While growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, it has been accompanied with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet, with domestic inflationary pressures contained. Inflation is thus forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.
In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney and Melbourne, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. Regulatory measures are helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices have moved lower and been more volatile recently, in parallel with developments in global markets. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices.
The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers slammed the brakes on hiring over the last two months and wages fell in September, raising new doubts the economy is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by the end of this year.
Payrolls outside of farming rose by 142,000 last month and August figures were revised sharply lower to show only 136,000 jobs added that month, the Labor Department said on Friday.
That marked the smallest two-month gain in employment in over a year and could fuel fears that the China-led global economic slowdown is sapping America's strength.
""You can't throw lipstick on this pig of a report,"" said Brian Jacobsen, a portfolio strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
The weak job growth took Wall Street by surprise and U.S. stocks sold off sharply. The dollar also weakened and yields for government bonds fell.
Bets on interest rate futures showed investors only saw a 27 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in December, down from around 44 percent before the job report's release.
""(With) a weak report here, in combination with some of the other weakness that we are seeing across the globe, the odds get dinged for December,"" said Tom Porcelli, an economist at RBC Capital Markets.
Investors saw virtually no chance the Fed would end its near-zero interest rate policy at its only other scheduled meeting this year, to be held later in October.
U.S. factories are feeling the global chill and shed 9,000 jobs in September after losing 18,000 in August, according to the Labor Department's survey of employers.
""There is no doubt that the events happening in the rest of the world are affecting the U.S. economy,"" White House chief economist Jason Furman told CNBC.
The recent pace of job growth should have been enough to push the unemployment rate lower because only around 100,000 new jobs are needed a month to keep up with population growth.
But the jobless rate held steady at 5.1 percent. The unemployment rate is derived from a separate survey of households that showed 350,000 workers dropping out of the labor force last month, as well as a lower level of employment.
The share of the population in the work force, which includes people who have jobs or are looking for one, fell to 62.4 percent, the lowest level since 1977.
Average hourly wages fell by a cent to $25.09 during the month and were up only 2.2 percent from the same month in 2014, holding around the same levels seen all year and pointing to marginal inflationary pressures.
The report did have a few bright spots that might be welcomed by Fed chief Janet Yellen, who said last week the economy was doing well enough to warrant higher rates this year.
The number of workers with part-time jobs but who want more hours fell by 447,000 in September to 6.0 million.
Yellen has signaled that the elevated number of these workers points to hidden slack in the labor market that isn't captured by the jobless rate. A measure of joblessness that includes these workers and is closely followed by the Fed fell to 10 percent, its lowest level since May 2008.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected job growth of 203,000 in September.
All told, revised estimates meant 59,000 fewer jobs were created in July and August than previously believed.
In another grim sign, the number of hours worked in the country fell 0.2 percent, raising the specter that some broader softness might have gripped the economy last month.
One of the biggest lodestones on America's economy was in the commodity sector, which has slowed in part because of weaker demand from China.
The price of oil has fallen nearly 50 percent over the last year, and U.S. mining payrolls, which include energy sector jobs, fell by 10,000 in September, the ninth straight month of declines.

The government had previously reported that this gauge, which is a leading indicator of business investment, had fallen 0.2 percent during the month.
Shipments of this category of goods also fell, declining a sharper-than-initially reported 0.4 percent and giving a bearish signal for third-quarter economic growth.

This story was updated at 8:50 a.m. EDT
U.S. employers added 142,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate remained at 5.1 percent, the Labor Department said Friday. The report was forecast to show employers adding 203,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 5.1 percent, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Amid the recent stock market turmoil and concerns of a slowing global economy, economists question whether the U.S. is strong enough to move away from crisis-level interest rates. In September, U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged last month but left the door open to hiking rate as early as October. Nearly half (47%) of experts predict the central bank will raise rates in December, according to Bankrate.com.
Even so, many economists are still not seeing the accelerated growth that suggests the economy needs to slow -- or that businesses are experiencing wage pressure.
Wage growth -- which has been stagnant for years -- remained at 2.2 percent. The average hourly earnings for private-sector workers fell by 1 cents to $25.09. For most workers, however, real wages have fallen or remained flat for more than three decades.
Part of the reason real wage growth remains stagnant is because the recovery has come with stronger employment growth in low-wage industries, such as accommodation and food services, temporary help services, retail trade and long-term health care. These jobs account for nearly two-fifths of all new jobs added since the labor market bottomed out in February 2010, according to the Center for American Progress.

Somewhat troubling, though, the labor force participation rate continues to drop, which indicates more Americans giving up on finding work.
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month, at 2.1 million, constituting 26.6 percent of the unemployed. Meanwhile, many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full time, and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest proportion opting out of the workforce since the 1970s.
The labor-force participation rate remains at its lowest level since the late 1977s, a near 40-year low. That rate fell to 62.4 percent from the prior month, according to the report released Friday.
One thing to consider is the August payrolls report is notoriously revised higher. However, the change for August was revised from 173,000 to 136,000. Over the past 5 years or so the August payroll count tends to be revised up by 75,000 to 100,000 over time, John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The pace of growth at U.S. factories slowed in September, a sign that the chill falling over the global economy could complicate the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates.
Other data on Thursday pointed to a tightening labor market and stronger spending on home construction, highlighting the split in the economy between strong domestic growth and weakness abroad.
This is causing headaches at the Fed, which cited concerns last month about ""global economic and financial developments"" when it surprised much of Wall Street by holding off on hiking rates.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 50.2, its lowest since May 2013 and just below the median forecast in a Reuters poll. 
While any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, growth has slowed sharply over the last year as a strong dollar has crimped exports. 
More recently, a slowdown in China is dragging on global growth. The ISM's index for exports held steady at 46.5, marking a contraction in activity for the fourth straight month. 
The dollar drifted lower while yields on Treasury debt also declined. Wall Street stocks were trading lower. 
Despite the weakness abroad, America's domestic economy and the labor market have appeared on more solid footing, which has boosted expectations the Fed could hike rates this year or in early 2016.
The Labor Department said the number of new applications for U.S. jobless benefits rose modestly last week, although they remained near 15-year lows and a gauge of the trend in claims fell. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended Sept. 26.
""Filings at this level are incredibly low by historical standards, speaking to how tight labor markets are getting,"" said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Small businesses added 0.18 worker per firm in September, the best growth this year, the National Federation of Independent Business said in a report. America's monthly employment report due on Friday is expected to show 203,000 positions added to payrolls last month, a pickup from the pace in August.
U.S. construction spending climbed in August to the highest level since 2008, the Commerce Department said in a separate report. The gains were boosted by a surge in outlays for residential projects and gave a sign the housing market was helping the overall economy.
In another sign of domestic strength, the big three U.S. automakers - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) NV - reported a jump in September sales as cheap gasoline and ultra-low interest rates drove demand for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2015 11:31AM ET</span>","Global economy loses steam as Chinese, European factories falter","By Sumanta Dey and Andy Bruce
BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - World economic growth lost momentum in September, with China's factory output shrinking again, euro zone manufacturing growth slowing, and U.S. activity steady. 
The latest business surveys across Asia, Europe and the Americas paint a gloomier picture and are likely to prompt more calls for central banks to loosen monetary policy even further.
""The data probably increases the case for more stimulus in certain parts of the world, especially from the People's Bank of China and the European Central Bank,"" said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in London.
""Those economies that are at less advanced paths of the recovery cycle -- the key example is the euro zone, where we're looking at more disinflation -- may well find more stimulus is in order.""
CHINA MANUFACTURING STILL CONTRACTING
Surveys of China's factory and services sectors showed the world's second largest economy may be cooling more rapidly than earlier thought, with deeper job cuts.
Taken together with a stock market crash in Shanghai during the summer and a surprise devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the data highlight just how difficult it will be for policymakers to steer China's economy out of the biggest slowdown in decades.
""Two straight months of manufacturing sector contraction with a depressed equity market suggests China's third-quarter GDP growth is likely to have slowed to 6.4 percent,"" economists at ANZ said.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)in China inched up to 49.8 in September from 49.7, but was still below the 50 level on the index separating growth from contraction. 
Private data vendor Caixin/Markit reported its China PMI slipped to 47.2 in September though, the lowest reading since March 2009. 
In China's service sector the official PMI stood at 53.4, the same as August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
The Caixin/Markit service sector PMI fell for a second consecutive month to 50.5, its lowest level since July 2014. 
China is a major importer of raw materials, especially from commodity producers such as Australia, Brazil and Canada, so a slowdown in demand is being felt globally. 
Concerns over China and global market volatility figured high on a list of reasons the U.S. Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates last month.
MORE ECB STIMULUS AS PRICES DROP
In the euro zone, where the central bank is six months into a 1.1 trillion euro asset purchase program, the PMI survey data showed manufacturing output weakened slightly last month.
Markit's final euro zone manufacturing PMI was 52.0 last month, lower than August's 52.3. 
ECB policymakers, led by President Mario Draghi, have hinted the 60-billion-euro-a-month bond-buying scheme could be enhanced in size or duration if inflation is seen missing its goal of near 2.0 percent even by 2017.
Factories in Europe's number one economy, Germany, performed better, however, driven by strong output from consumer goods producers and rising new orders. 
The PMIs also showed French manufacturing grew faster than first thought in September, while British factory growth lost steam and shed jobs for the first time since 2013.
The drag on the UK economy is likely to weigh on the Bank of England which is considering when the appropriate time is to raise interest rates from the current 0.50 percent, where they have stayed since March 2009.
U.S. MANUFACTURING SLUGGISH
In the Americas, growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector rose slightly in September but was still at its second-lowest level since Oct. 2013, according to Markit. 
The final U.S. manufacturing PMI inched higher to 53.1 in September from 53.0 in August, which marked the lowest level since Oct. 2013.
""The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a distinct loss of growth momentum in recent months, endured the worst performance for two years during the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
""Headwinds include the rising dollar, weak demand in global markets, a downturn in business investment and financial market jitters,"" he added. 
An alternative U.S. manufacturing survey from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) showed the pace of factory activity slowed in September while remaining at its lowest level since May 2013.
Business conditions in the Canadian manufacturing sector fell to a record low in August as the country continues to feel the effect of cheap oil prices.
The RBC/Market manufacturing PMI for Canada fell to 48.6 last month from 49.4 in August and is now at the lowest level in the survey's five-year history. 
Canada was in a mild recession in the first half of the year as the oil-exporter has been hurt by the drop in the price of crude oil.
In Latin America, Brazil's manufacturing PMI rose to 47.0 in September from 45.8 in August but the sector has now contracted for an eighth straight month. 
Brazil's economy is struggling through its worst recession in 25 years, leaving the nation's long-crippled manufacturing sector reeling. Manufacturers have laid off nearly half a million workers over the past 12 months as output shrunk to 2009 levels. 
Mexico's HSBC/Markit manufacturing PMI fell to 52.1 from 52.4 in August.

1564,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 01, 2015 02:00AM ET</span>",China's Factories Hit By Export Slump,"By Duncan Hewitt -

SHANGHAI -- Conditions in China’s manufacturing sector deteriorated “at the sharpest rate since March 2009,” according to latest data from the private Caixin China Purchasing Managers’ Index survey, while the country's services sector barely managed to stay afloat, the PMI data showed.
The monthly Caixin PMI reading, which measures orders and output in the private sector, and at small and medium enterprises, declined to 47.2 in September, down from 47.3 the previous month. Any reading below 50 implies a contraction in the sector, and the figures are the latest confirmation of the slowdown in China’s economy, hit in part by falling exports.
China’s services sector is also seen as a key driver of the country’s growth, particularly with export-driven manufacturing struggling, and the Caixin PMI figure for the sector -- while remaining in positive territory at 50.5 -- represented a sharp fall from 51.5 in August, with new orders growing at their slowest pace for more than a year.

Caixin, the respected Chinese financial magazine that compiles the index, said new export orders were down by their fastest pace since March 2009, while overall factory orders fell at the fastest pace in three years. Factory inventories of unsold goods also saw their sharpest rise in three years as a result. And companies were responding by laying off workers and cutting output at the fastest pace since early 2009 in the midst of the global financial crisis, Caixin said.
Meanwhile official figures released by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that overall manufacturing PMI, which includes large state enterprises as well as smaller businesses, inched up to 49.8 in September from 49.7 in August, with new orders back in positive territory, rising to 50.2 from 49.7. Export demand also rose fractionally, but remained in negative territory at 47.9. The official PMI figure for the service sector remained unchanged in September, at 53.4.
Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, acknowledged in a statement that the figures revealed “relatively weak internal and external demand and the manufacturing sector is still facing relatively big downward pressures.""
The Chinese government has cut interest rates five times in the past year, in an effort to stimulate spending and help companies raise funds. But factory activity has now fallen for seven successive months -- and concerns about other sectors of the economy remain. And while service providers continued to take on more staff, Caixin said new hiring in the sector “was not enough to offset factory job cuts.” It also said that both manufacturers and service providers cut prices in September amid weaker customer demand.

China’s manufacturing industry has reached a “crucial stage in its structural transformation,” according to He Fan, chief economist of the Caixin Insight Group, which compiles the PMI index. However he said that while the manufacturing industry faced “continued weakness” due to what he called tepid demand, “pressure driving the sector’s decline has eased,” noting that the fall in the PMI figure had slowed from August.
He and his colleague Zhu He said, in a Caixin commentary last week, based on preliminary figures for the month that it was likely that the economy would “stop declining and recover within the next few months,” adding that there were no signs the economy would suffer a hard landing.
And some international economists echo the view that China's slowdown may stabilize somewhat in the coming months. While China’s industrial profits fell sharply in August by 8.8 percent, consumption has continued to rise, with retail sales growth picking up slightly in August, rising 10.8 percent year-on-year -- compared to 10.5 percent in July.
Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong, said in a research note sent to International Business Times Thursday that profitability of manufacturing related to consumption and services has ""held up well."" Liu predicted that China’s third-quarter economic growth would slow to 6.4 percent, well below the government's target of ""around 7 percent.""
He said slowing exports were not the only factor; the end of China’s stock market boom had also hit financial services, which did exceptionally well in the first half of the year. However he said that monetary policy easing, making bank lending easier, and expansionary fiscal policy, with a sharp rise in government spending in recent months, would gradually take effect, leading to a “modest rebound to 6.8 percent in the final quarter of the year” and overall annual growth of the same rate.
The government has taken a series of measures, including announcing major new investment in railways and other infrastructure, to help boost both raw materials manufacturing sector and employment. It has also announced measures to stimulate slowing auto sales, by halving taxes on purchases of new small cars, and is also seeking to boost real estate sales.

The authorities this week cut the minimum down payment for first-time home buyers from 30 percent to 25 percent (except in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.) The move is seen as an attempt to boost a market that has been cooled by tighter official restrictions over the past three years. Home sales and prices have risen in many major cities this year, but the picture remains mixed around the country, and investment in new construction is sharply down.
The official People’s Daily newspaper said in a commentary to mark China’s National Day on Oct. 1 that the world’s second largest economy was in a phase where the shift from old to new engines of growth would lead to ""inevitable contradictions,"" and courage would be required. It said China was now “climbing the steepest part of the slope in its ascent to the summit,” but it said that the Chinese people had proved in the past that they could overcome any challenges."

Chinese consumers are optimistic even in the aftermath of a Shanghai stock market rout and an economic slowdown. Consumer sentiment in China rose to its highest point in more than a year, according to Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator.
The reading of 118.2 was a 1.5 percent increase from August, the fourth straight month of improved sentiment and the strongest measure since May 2014.

Despite garnering international attention, the wild moves in China's major stock markets haven't fazed ordinary urban Chinese consumers, only 11 percent of whom identify themselves as owning equities. Instead, the loosening of credit restrictions and reforms to state-owned enterprises have preoccupied Chinese consumers, who are happy with the developments.
Fewer Chinese report spending more than 50 percent of their income on daily expenses, Westpac said in its report, while spending on leisure activities increased.
“Our cross-section of urban Chinese consumers seems oblivious to the tirade of negativity that surrounds China at the moment,"" MNI Indicators Chief Economist Philip Uglow said. ""While China’s traditional industrial growth engine is slowing, the growing consumer and service sector should help to underpin growth in the months and years ahead.”
Meanwhile, China's slowing demand for imports in recent months has dragged global trade down and sent shivers of unease through financial markets around the world. Yet the measure remains only 1.7 percent below its long-term average, Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies hired workers at a solid clip in September, but data showed factory activity in the U.S. Midwest contracted, muddying the economic picture for the Federal Reserve on whether to raise interest rates later this year.
U.S. private employers added 200,000 jobs in September, payrolls processor ADP said on Wednesday, the strongest reading since June. It beat a forecast 194,000 increase among economists polled by Reuters.
Private payroll gains in August were revised down to 186,000from an originally reported 190,000 increase.
The U.S. central bank's policy-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decided against ending its near zero interest rate policy in September, citing concerns about global risks and market turbulence stemming from China.
In recent days, several top Fed policy-makers including Chair Janet Yellen have said the Fed could raise rates later this year if the economy shows further improvement.
""As for the FOMC reacting to this report, the market can continue to view them as the suitor wondering why it should matter when he gives the engagement ring as long as she knows they are eventually going to be married,"" Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York.
Interest rates futures implied traders see a 11 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in October and a 39 percent chance it would do so in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
The latest ADP data supported expectations for private and government jobs gains to be reported by the U.S. Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect Friday's report to show U.S. employers hired 203,000 workers in September, improving from August's 173,000 increase which was the smallest in five months. The unemployment rate was forecast to hold at 5.1 percent, a near 7-1/2 year low. 
""If we are able to hold on this type of jobs growth, the odds are pretty good we'd be back to full employment in the summer of 2016,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters on a conference call.
Moody's Analytics jointly developed the private jobs report with ADP.
U.S. stocks rose partly on the better-than-expected ADP data, while Treasuries prices stayed in negative territory and the dollar tacked on earlier gains. 
U.S. MIDWEST FACTORY SLUMP
As the labor market seemed to hum along, manufacturing activity in the U.S. Midwest took an unexpected downturn as a strong dollar and weak overseas demand have hurt U.S. exports. 
The Chicago Purchasing Management Index fell in September to 48.7, its weakest since May, from August's 54.4. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53.0.
A reading below 50 suggests the Chicago-area factory sector is contracting despite strong vehicle demand.
A manufacturing gauge on the upper Midwest region fell to its lowest level since 2009.
Marquette University and the Institute for Supply Management-Milwaukee said its regional business barometer fell to 39.44 in September from 47.67 in August.

""In aggregate, growth still looks strong to keep the unemployment rate trending down,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

Eurozone economic confidence rose to a four-year high in September on improved industrial and service-sector sentiment, defying market expectations. The consumer and executive confidence index rose to 105.6 this month from a revised 104.1 in August, the European Commission said Tuesday. The uptick ran contrary to economists' predictions of a decline to 104.1 from the previously reported 104.2, according to Bloomberg data.
The reading is the highest since the index recorded 106.1 in April 2011.
The European Commission also measured inflation expectations among consumers for the coming 12 months, and found that it rose to 3.2 in September after dipping to 3.1 in August from 4.2 in July. However, it remained significantly lower than the long-term average of 19.7.
Industrial confidence in the region increased to minus 2.2, from minus 3.7 in August, fueled by rising production expectations. Sentiment in the services sector rose to 12.4 from 10.1 in the same period, fueled by expectations of increased demand.
Overall consumer confidence worsened slightly to minus 7.1 from minus 6.9 in the month before, and construction confidence also fell to minus 23.3 from minus 22.7 in August, the commission's report found.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said earlier this month that the ECB is prepared to expand its quantitative easing (QE) program to inject liquidity into the eurozone markets if falling oil prices and slowdown in emerging markets seemed likely to worsen the inflation outlook. Core inflation slowed to 0.9 percent in August from 1 percent in July.
However, eurozone prices have remained stagnant since the ECB began its $1.2 trillion QE program in March, and the inflation rate has slowed to 0.1 percent in August after rising to 0.3 percent in May."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending grew briskly in August and a key measure of inflation firmed a bit, signs of strength in America's domestic economy that could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates despite weakness abroad.
The Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent rise in July.
The figures give a bullish sign for economic growth in the third quarter.
""These data underscore the ongoing health of the consumer sector,"" said John Hoff, an economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) Securities.
The report could help convince investors of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's view, most recently expressed on Thursday, that the economy was strong enough to warrant a rate increase this year. New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday also said a hike was likely this year and could come as soon as October.
Investors have been doubtful, with many betting that the Fed's first rate increase in a decade won't come until March.
But the U.S. dollar firmed following the consumer spending report, as did yields on U.S. government debt, signs that some investors were bringing forward their bets on a rate increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.3 percent last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
It was the latest report indicating momentum in the economy as it confronted recent global financial markets turbulence, sparked by concerns over a slowing Chinese economy, which pushed the Fed to hold off hiking rates earlier in September.
The economy grew at a robust 3.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Last month, spending on long-lasting goods such as automobiles increased 0.9 percent. Outlays on services like utilities rose 0.5 percent.
Personal income increased 0.3 percent in August.
Overall inflation remained muted, reflecting low oil prices. Inflation, which has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target in annual terms, rose just 0.3 percent in August from the same month a year earlier.
However, prices were up 1.3 percent when excluding food and energy, a key metric used by the Fed to gauge the trend rate of inflation. In July, core prices rose 1.2 percent year-over-year.

Despite the positive signals for consumer spending, the U.S. housing market appeared to loose a step last month, with contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes falling 1.4 percent.
"
1621,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2015 10:09AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales decline in August,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes decreased in August, indicating the robust housing market could be losing some steam.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 1.4 percent to 109.4.
The index rose 6.1 percent from the same month a year ago, marking 12 straight months of year-over-year gains.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's decrease suggested further losses in home resales, which fell more than expected in August. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.4 percent last month.
Contracts decreased 5.6 percent in the Northeast and 0.4 percent in the Midwest. They dropped 2.2 percent in the South but rose 1.8 percent in the West.

In all regions, contracts remain above where they were a year ago.

Profits for industrial companies in China dropped 8.8 percent in August, compared to the previous year, Bloomberg reported Monday. It was the biggest fall since October 2011, when the Chinese government first published such data. Chinese coal, oil and gas and metal companies had the greatest losses, information from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
The reported losses follow the crash in mid-August of the Shanghai Composite Index, which reverberated globally, as markets and indexes in Europe, the United States and Australia sank in response. Prior to the crash, the People's Bank of China had devalued China's currency, the yuan, in an effort to fend off an economic slowdown, to little avail.
China's economic woes stem in part from decreased demand for goods manufactured there. In August, foreign and domestic demand dropped for such products, and factories cut jobs for the 24th month in a row, Reuters reported Sept. 1. In August, Chinese industrial production grew 6.1 percent year-on-year, below the median growth forecast of 6.6 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported.
China stocks fall to one-week low as industrial profits slump http://t.co/kluXy8u31P pic.twitter.com/hDvmTcSaxD
— Bloomberg Business (@business) September 28, 2015
In the coal-mining industry, profits dropped 64.9 percent in the first eight months of 2015. Profits in the oil and gas sector fell 67.3 percent. The sagging profits were due in part to lower prices, as well as lower returns on investment, a Chinese official at the National Bureau of Statistics, told Bloomberg. Higher costs also contributed to decreasing profits, as the recent stock market slump helped drive up spending and decrease investment returns.
China is the world's second-largest economy. State-owned companies had fared the worst of all, with profits dropped by 24.7 percent in the first eight months of 2015, compared to an increase in profits of 7.3 for privately held corporations, the report from the National Bureau of Statistics showed."

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2015 11:19AM ET</span>",Stronger U.S. second quarter growth backs case for Fed hike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded more than previously estimated in the second quarter on stronger consumer spending and construction, backing the case for an interest rate rise before the end of the year despite data sounding a note of caution for September.
The Commerce Department said on Friday gross domestic product rose at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter, up from the 3.7 percent pace reported last month.
The data supports the case that the U.S. economy may be gaining enough strength to withstand an increase in benchmark interest rates from record low levels despite growing concerns about the global economy.
Still, many economists are expecting a cooler pace of growth in the third quarter, a view bolstered by separate data showing slower growth in services and a drop in consumer sentiment in September.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last week held off on hiking rates, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen kept the door open to an increase this year in a speech on Thursday night, as long as inflation remains stable and growth is strong enough to boost employment.
""There are a lot of things to like about the domestic side of the economy for the second half of the year despite all the global malaise,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. ""If the domestic economy holds in there, (Fed policymakers) are going to hike in December.""
Second-quarter growth, which beat expectations in a Reuters poll for the third GDP reading to be unchanged at 3.7 percent, was bolstered by higher consumer spending, mainly on services like healthcare and transport.
Treasury debt prices extended losses and the dollar hit a fresh five-week high against a basket of currencies on the second-quarter figures, although U.S. stock index futures pared some gains after the September data was released.
The preliminary Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector from Markit slipped to 55.6 in September from the final 56.1 reading in August. A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
""The survey data point to sustained steady expansion of the U.S. economy at the end of the third quarter, but various warning lights are now flashing brighter, meaning growth may continue to weaken in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
The University of Michigan's final reading on consumer sentiment for September slipped to 87.2 from 91.9 in August, although it was higher than expectations.
STRONGER BASE
But the stronger consumer spending and a smaller inventory build reported for the second quarter are a good sign for growth in the July-September period.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to a 3.6 percent growth pace from the 3.1 percent rate reported in August, helped by cheap gasoline prices and relatively higher house prices boosting household wealth.
Revised construction spending data helped to push up the headline figure, with non-residential fixed investment expanding 4.1 percent in the quarter. Business investment on structures was revised upwards along with residential fixed investment.
The revisions to second-quarter growth also reflected a smaller accumulation of inventories than earlier estimated, reducing the chance that a sharp unwinding in inventories would drag on growth.
""For the Fed, the forward-looking part is most important and the one positive take-away is inventory contribution,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities.
""There had been quite a bit of fear that strong inventory building in Q2 would be unwound in Q3. It actually shows GDP should be a little firmer in the next quarter, but not by a whole lot.""
After-tax corporate profits were also stronger in the second quarter than previously thought. Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments showed a 2.6 percent rebound from a slump in late 2014 and early 2015.

For near-term growth prospects, the government repeated its warning about sluggish growth in Asian emerging market economies caused by the recent Chinese slowdown.
In its monthly report for September, the government continued to say the domestic economy is on a ""moderate recovery"" trend but noted it has some soft spots: consumer spending is sluggish, exports are weak and business sentiment is flat.
In an unprecedented move, the government declined to say officially in its report whether it is downgrading its view.
But Yutaka Murayama, director of macro-economic analysis at the Cabinet Office, told reporters the overall judgment is ""weaker than last month"" and ""closer to a downgrade."" He said he would not deny it is a ""de facto downgrade.""
""The slowness in some areas we noted in the report refers to the disappointing pace of improvement in the positive economic growth mechanism as seen in consumption and business investment,"" Murayama said. But he added that the expression ""slowness"" is less negative than the term ""weakness"" used last year to describe the slump caused by the April 2014 sales tax hike.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business investment fell slightly in August, excluding spending on aircraft and defense equipment, but new home sales rose, suggesting that global economic headwinds were doing little to impede U.S. growth.
The U.S. economy is on track to grow 1.4 percent in the third quarter, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday.
The Commerce Department said capital goods orders excluding military wares and aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent last month, a slightly bigger fall than analysts polled by Reuters had expected.
However, August's decline followed a gain in July that was the largest in over a year and which had boosted optimism that many American companies were unfazed by weak overseas markets.
The recent trend in orders gives a good signal for economic growth in the third quarter after business investment on equipment fell in the April-June period.
""Investment in equipment appears to be recovering,"" said Paul Ashworth, an economist for Capital Economics.
Durable goods orders overall fell 2.0 percent in August, in line with forecasts, but held back by a sharp decline in orders for civilian aircraft. Excluding transportation, orders were little changed.
Some business sectors are being hit by falling commodity prices though, with  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) saying it might close or consolidate more than 20 plants around the world across its three large businesses - construction, resources, and energy and transportation.
Caterpillar Inc cut its 2015 revenue forecast and said it could cut up to 10,000 jobs through 2018, on Thursday joining a list of big U.S. industrial companies grappling with the shock waves from the mining and energy downturn.
U.S. stock prices were lower in afternoon trading on Thursday, weighed down by a 6.0 percent fall in the shares of Caterpillar, the world's biggest mining and construction equipment maker. (N)
Other economic data on Thursday showed that robust job growth over the last year has helped the country's housing market, which took a big hit in the 2007-09 recession.
A separate report from the U.S. Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended Sept. 19. Analysts had expected new claims to rise more.
The four-week moving average of jobless claims fell by 750 to 271,750, which was close to its lowest level since 2000 and suggests the job market continues to strengthen.
The trend in jobless claims continues to give bullish signs on the health of the U.S. labor market, which is critical for the Federal Reserve's plans to lift interest rates as soon as this year.
Other U.S. economic data on Thursday showed new home sales in August surged 5.7 percent to an annual pace of 552,000 or the highest level since 2008. The gain was much larger than analysts had expected and came on the back of a strong revision in the pace of sales during July.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week that the Fed declined to raise interest rates in September in part because of concerns that weakness in China's economy could slow global economic growth, but there is little sign of an appreciable U.S. slowdown yet.
The U.S. economy is on track to grow 1.4 percent in the third quarter following a steeper-than-forecast 4.8 percent drop in home resales in August, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Friday.
This was a slightly slower pace from the regional Fed bank's prior estimate of 1.5 percent on Sept. 17, the Atlanta Fed said on its website.
""The decline occurred on Monday when the model's forecast for third-quarter real residential investment growth fell in response to the existing home sales release from the National Association of Realtors,"" the Atlanta Fed said on its website.
The government will release its third reading of U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the final reading on second-quarter GDP likely come in at 3.7 percent.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 7,000 to 271,000.

Continuing jobless claims in the week ended September 12 fell to 2.242 million from 2.243 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.235 million.
The four-week moving average was 271,750, a decrease of 750 from the previous week’s total of 272,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Wednesday as fears of an entrenched global economic slowdown gripped investors, underlined by a weak factory survey from China, while the greenback firmed as investors fled to relatively safe-haven assets.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 2 percent, with Australia down 1.8 percent and South Korea falling 1 percent. S&P mini futures fell 1 percent after the weak China PMI.
""The industrial sector in China remains a concern indicating that the economy is not out of the woods yet while the Fed's comments last week indicate a glass half-empty view of the global economy,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong.
More evidence of an entrenched slowdown was evident as activity in China's factory sector shrank at a faster pace than expected in September, falling to its weakest level in 6-1/2 years as domestic and export demand continued to slump, a private survey showed.
China's stock markets took the weak data on the chin with main indices down between 2-3 percent in opening trades. Japanese markets are shut through Wednesday.
Fresh cracks in the commodities complex, amplified by drops in copper, raised concerns that a China-led slowdown may pose significant headwinds for riskier assets, particularly global equities. On Tuesday, the Asian Development Bank lowered its growth forecast for China to 6.8 percent for 2015.
Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.09 percent, the S&P 500 lost 1.23 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 percent to 4,756.72.
Losses in equities prompted investors to plough funds into fixed income assets. The benchmark two-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 0.67 percent, nearing a two-week low.
The spread between the 10-year bond and the 2-year bond has narrowed to 146 basis points from 176 basis points in early July, indicating markets were expecting sub-par economic growth.
Risk aversion was particularly evident in the currency complex with the relatively higher-yielding Australian dollar wallowing at more than one-week lows.
In currencies, the U.S. dollar consolidated most of its overnight gains in early Asian trade. It held firm at 96.439 against a basket of six currencies, after earlier rising 1 percent. The Japanese yen held firm against the dollar at 120.24 as investors shied away from adding risky bets.
U.S. crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $46.57 per barrel, while Brent futures were 0.3 percent firmer at $49.22.
In its biggest one-day drop in more than two months, copper sank to three-week lows as fund and speculative selling pushed prices through sell stops, accelerating the pace of declines.

The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales dropped 4.8 percent to an annual rate of 5.31 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 5.51 million-unit pace of home sales last month. Sales were up 6.2 percent from a year ago.
The decline in August might be due to rising prices shutting out potential buyers, said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. Home sales fell most in America's South and West, areas which had recently seen the fastest price gains, he said.
Nationwide, the median home price fell slightly in August to $228,700. That was still up 4.7 percent from a year earlier, but left the year-over-year rate at its lowest since August 2014. Prices in the West were up 7.1 percent from a year earlier.
A string of strong reports on the U.S. housing market have supported the view that the U.S. economy is building up steam and closing in on the point when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates to keep it from overheating.
The pace of sales in July remained at an eight-year high even after being revised slightly lower on Monday.
Shares in home builders held onto gains following the release of the data, with the PHLX housing index up 0.8 percent. The U.S. stock market was also generally higher, and yields on U.S. government debt continued higher.
The housing market has been adding to quarterly economic growth although home sales and construction remain far below levels seen in the years before the 2007-09 recession.
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN), the No.2 U.S. homebuilder by volume, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Monday as it sold more homes at higher prices.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales declined 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted 5.31 million units last month from 5.58 million in July. Analysts had expected existing home sales to fall 1.3% to 5.51 million units in August.
Following three straight months of gains, existing home sales dipped in August despite slowing price growth and a positive turnaround in the share of sales to first-time buyers, according to the National Association of Realtors. None of the four major regions experienced sales increases in August.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says home sales in August lost some momentum to close out the summer.
""Sales activity was down in many parts of the country last month, especially in the South and West, as the persistent summer theme of tight inventory levels likely deterred some buyers,"" he said.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2015 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims at eight-week low; housing starts take breather,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in eight weeks, suggesting the labor market continued to strengthen despite the recent tightening in financial market conditions. 
While other data on Thursday showed housing starts fell for a second straight month in August, they remained above the one million-unit mark, which signals a housing market growing at a solid clip. In addition, building permits rose last month.
The signs of a firming economy are supportive of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this year, after the U.S. central bank kept borrowing costs near zero on Thursday, citing concerns about the global economy.
""Speculation will now shift to December as the next most likely month for U.S. rates to start rising,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London. 
""The 'data dependent' Fed will want to see further robust nonfarm payroll growth between now and then as well as indications that the pace of economic growth is not wilting under the pressure of China's slowdown."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 264,000 for the week ended Sept. 12, the Labor Department said. 
That was the best reading since the week ended July 18, when claims hit their lowest level since 1973. It was the 28th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
The dollar fell to a three-week low against the euro on the Fed's rate decision, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt rallied. Stocks on Wall Street ended lower in volatile trade.
Concerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies ignited volatility in financial markets. The ensuing drop in equity prices, further dollar gains and a widening of risk spreads caused some tightening in financial conditions.
FIRMING LABOR MARKET
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls portion of the September employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the August and September survey weeks, suggesting some pickup in job growth after a slowdown in August.
Labor market conditions are tightening, with record high job openings. At a 7-1/2-year low of 5.1 percent, the unemployment rate is within the range most Fed officials think is consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation. 
In a press conference after the rate decision, Fed Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged the labor market improvement, but said some cyclical weakness likely remains.
In a second report, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking for new homes dropped 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.13 million units last month.
Despite the fall, which reflected declines in groundbreaking on single and multifamily projects, starts remained above a one million-unit pace for the fifth straight month. Building permits increased 3.5 percent last month to a 1.17 million-unit pace, after declining 15.5 percent in July. 
""The small dip in August housing starts is minor considering the sustained momentum we've seen in housing overall in 2015,"" said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit. 
""When you couple the slow but steady rise in single-family unit construction with an increase in builder confidence, it's further support that housing is returning to its place as a major player in driving economic growth."" 
The firming labor market has unleashed pent-up demand for housing, especially among young adults. A report on Wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders advancing to a near decade high in September. 
Yellen said the housing market should be doing even better.
""Housing starts are below levels that seem consistent with underlying demographics especially in an economy that's creating jobs and we have lots of people who are still doubled up and demand for housing should be there and should materialize as the job market improves and income growth improves,"" she said.
In August, groundbreaking for single-family homes, which accounts for the largest share of the market, fell 3.0 percent. Single-family home building in the South, where most of the home construction takes place, rose 9.2 percent to the highest level since December 2007. 
Starts for the volatile multifamily segment also fell 3.0 percent. Single-family building permits rose 2.8 percent in August to their highest level since January 2008. Multi-family building permits rose 4.7 percent.
A third report showed manufacturing continued to struggle against the headwinds of a strong dollar and soft global demand. 
The Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index fell to minus 6.0 in September from positive 8.3 in August. A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing.

1684,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 17, 2015 02:16PM ET</span>",Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged ,"By Jessica Menton -

In one of the most widely anticipated Federal Reserve decisions in decades, the U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged Thursday. The Fed's pronouncement to leave rates at historic lows—where they’ve been since roughly the start of the Great Recession in 2008—signals that the U.S. economy has yet to fully recover from the near collapse.
In leaving rates untouched, central bankers expressed concern about fundamental aspects of the U.S. economy and the affect global developments --such as China's economic slowdown-- might have on American business.
""The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad,"" the Fed said in its Thursday afternoon statement.
Market professionals are now looking ahead to a press conference from Fed Chair Janet Yellen at 2:30 p.m. EDT, searching for further hints as to the timing of the Fed’s future course of rate hikes.
“Uncertainty from the Fed has been the biggest issue,” Stephen Guilfoyle, managing director of floor operations at Deep Value Inc. said from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. “If they give us some length and depth of the tightening cycle and where they are headed, that would remove a lot of ambiguity.”
U.S. central bank policymakers met for a two-day meeting Wednesday and Thursday, discussing whether tightening monetary policy too soon could damage the economy and dampen the prospects for maximum employment and the targeted 2 percent inflation.
Economists were evenly split on whether the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's board that determines the direction of monetary policy, would announce a change to its monetary policy. The Fed has signaled recently that it could begin returning interest rates to normal levels sometime this year, which would mark the first rate hike since 2006. However, mounting fears that China’s economic slowdown will ripple across the globe and infect U.S. growth had economists evenly split about the prospects of a rate hike this week.
According to a Wall Street Journal poll of 60 business and academic economists, 46 percent surveyed this month pegged September as the most likely time for the Fed’s first rate hike, while 9.5 percent said the Fed would lift off in October and 35 percent said the Fed would wait until December.​ However, expectations have fallen sharply in the past few weeks amid stock market turmoil. In early August, 82 percent of economists thought the Fed would raise rates in September.
The Fed also released its updated projections for this year, including gross domestic product, the unemployment rate and inflation.
The central bank dropped the word ""patient,"" from its statement in March, signaling that the U.S. central bank is one step closer to ending near-zero interest rates. The move gave the Fed the option -- but not necessarily the obligation -- to raise interest rates at its discretion throughout 2015.
Since the removal of the word “patient,” the committee has introduced a new phrase in its speeches: the central bank needs to have “confidence in the outlook” that inflation will return to the 2 percent target."

The SNB held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at -0.75%, in line with expectations. The central bank also left the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between -1.25% and -0.25%.
The Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued, despite a slight depreciation, the central bank’s statement said.
The statement added that negative interest rates and the SNB’s willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market to make investments in Swiss francs less attractive both served to ease pressure on the franc.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan was to comment on the decision at a press conference later in the day.
EUR/CHF was trading at 1.0957 from around 1.0969 ahead of the decision, while USD/CHF was at 0.9688 from 0.9708 earlier.
