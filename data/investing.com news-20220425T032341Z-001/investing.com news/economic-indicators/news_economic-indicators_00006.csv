LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's consumers picked up the pace of their borrowing in April, according to data that could reassure the Bank of England that the economy is ready for another interest rate hike after a cold winter slump.
Also on Thursday, surveys showed consumers turned a bit more confident this month, possibly reflecting an easing of a Brexit-related squeeze on their spending power, and companies were more upbeat too.
""The figures will give the Monetary Policy Committee increased confidence in their assessment that the Q1 slowdown was just a blip,"" Andrew Wishart, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said.
""The figures chime with other signs that consumer spending growth is starting to strengthen, such as strong retail sales in April. And the rise in consumer confidence in May suggests that consumer credit growth will continue to grow strongly.""
Britain's economy, which has slowed sharply since voters decided in mid-2016 to leave the European Union, nearly ground to a halt in the first three months of 2018, when the country was hit by unusually cold weather.
The slowdown prompted the BoE to hold off from raising interest rates this month. It noted the sharp fall in consumer borrowing when it explained why it kept rates on hold.
Thursday's data from the BoE showed consumer credit jumped by a bigger-than-expected 1.832 billion pounds, the strongest rise since November 2016, up from an increase of only 425 million pounds in March.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected consumer lending to show a net increase of 1.3 billion pounds.
The annual growth rate in consumer lending edged up to 8.8 percent from 8.6 percent in March, its slowest increase since November 2015, the BoE said.
A surge in consumer credit peaked in late 2016 when it was growing by 11 percent a year. 
Since then, the BoE has urged banks to scale back risky lending, and consumers have felt the pinch from higher inflation after the Brexit vote and weak wage growth.
But there are signs that the squeeze on spending power is easing. Inflation has eased in recent months and wage growth is slowly picking up speed. 
The monthly GfK consumer confidence survey showed households felt more upbeat about their personal finances although the remained largely pessimistic about the economy ahead of Brexit next March.
In contrast to the signs of a pickup among consumers, Britain's housing market remains in the doldrums.
Prices rose by 2.4 percent in the 12 months to May, down from rates of around 5 percent shortly before the referendum, mortgage lender Nationwide said.

The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase edged down to 62,455 in April from 62,802 in March, below economists' forecasts of 63,000 in the Reuters poll.

1,By Investing.com,"<span>May 31, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Euro Zone Inflation Accelerates in May,"Investing.com - Inflation in the euro zone accelerated in May, according to a flash estimate released on Thursday, adding to the dilemma facing the European Central Bank as it debates unwinding its stimulus program.
The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index rose to 1.9% year-on-year in May, up from 1.2% in April and above expectations for a reading of 1.6%.
The main factor behind the increase was the recent sharp rise in oil prices. Energy prices were up 6.1% in the year to May, more than double April's 2.6% Eurostat said.
Core, or underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, rose to an annual rate of 1.1% from 0.7% in the previous month.
The ECB targets inflation of close to but just below 2% for the euro zone as a whole.
The data came a day after figures showing that inflation in Germany, the euro zone’s largest economy, rose more than expected in May, hitting 2.2%, its highest level in more than a year, while data also showed inflation picking up in Spain.
The ECB is facing a choice between containing market turmoil which has arisen amid concerns over Italy’s political stability and sticking to plans to end its quantitative easing program.
At the start of the year the ECB had hoped to begin winding up its stimulus program towards the end of the year and begin raising interest rates around the middle of 2019.
But that timetable has been thrown into doubt by a slowdown in growth in the euro area since the start of the year and by political developments in Italy which saw the country’s bond yields spike earlier this week.
Most analysts believe that the ECB will wait until July - a month later than previously expected - to give markets updated guidance on its plans to begin phasing out its stimulus program.
At the same time, another report showed that the unemployment rate in the euro area ticked down to 8.5% in April from an upwardly revised 8.6% in the previous month."
2,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2018 12:11AM ET</span>","China May factory growth at 8-month high, but tight funding hits smaller firms","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in eight months in May, blowing past expectations and easing concerns about an economic slowdown even as risks from trade tensions with the United States and a crackdown on debt point to a bumpy ride ahead. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.9 in May, from 51.4 in April, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 22nd straight month.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly to 51.3. 
Production expanded at the fastest rate in six months in May while growth in new orders rose to an 8-month high, helped by rising commodities prices. 
The strong manufacturing sector readings defy concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with the United States.
In particular, export orders improved from the previous month. Some economists suspect that Chinese firms have been front-loading shipments due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions.
On the whole, however, economists were skeptical of the sustainability of industrial sector strength, suggesting the broader economy will face pressure over coming months.
""We doubt this strength will be sustained for long given that it appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.
Nomura analysts were also of the view the strong PMI readings will be short-lived, saying ""the growth of end-demand, such as infrastructure and property investment, has slumped in recent months, due at least in part to the government’s deleveraging efforts.""
SMALL FIRMS FACE FUNDING PRESSURES
Beijing has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded. 
The industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector. 
But the latest survey showed that more manufacturers were concerned about tightening in funding over recent months, with 40.1 percent of all firms polled raising the issue in May, according to Zhao Qinghe, an official with the statistics bureau.
""Big cost pressure is still one of the major problems facing Chinese manufacturers these days,"" said Zhao. 
Activity of small firms contracted in May after expanding the previous month while both big and medium-sized companies all posted positive growth. 
Hi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April's 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.
Washington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States. 
China's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress were evident with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding. 
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.
Economists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check. 
Most China watchers had tipped growth to soften slightly in the second quarter, from a solid 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year. Yet, ANZ economists now see steady growth in the June quarter, citing support from increases in production and new orders in Thursday's PMI survey. 
A sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.
A sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.
A composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April's 54.1.

3,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",China's Factory Gauge Beats Estimates on Global Trade Resilience,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s official factory gauge rose more than estimated as export orders accelerated, signaling trade continues to drive expansion as the global economy powers through risks.
The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.9 in May, exceeding all forecasts in Bloomberg’s survey of economists, who projected the gauge to remain unchanged at 51.4. The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, rose for a third straight month to 54.9, the statistics bureau said Thursday, from 54.8 in April. Levels above 50 indicate improvement.
The PMI for new export orders increased to 51.2 from 50.7, readings of input and output prices climbed and inventories and backlogs of work declined.
Activity is holding up even as debt curbs, trade tensions with the U.S. and political strife from Turkey to Italy cloud the overall outlook. A temporary truce between the two biggest economies on trade is in danger of breaking down after President Donald Trump said this week that the U.S. will pursue tariffs on Chinese goods, a potential headwind for domestic manufacturing.
The PMI strength “highlights resilience of the economy at a time of external threats such as trade tensions with the U.S.,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Hong Kong. “Improved sentiment bodes well for activity in coming months across industries.”
The economy is stable with improvement and the trend is sustainable, China National Radio reported Thursday, citing Premier Li Keqiang’s comments at a May 29 meeting.
Still, the proportion of companies with tight funding conditions went up for a third month to 40.1 percent in May, underscoring the need to further strengthen financial support for the real economy, the statistics bureau said in a statement on its website.
Short-Lived?
The rebound “might be short lived, as growth of end demand such as infrastructure and property investment slumped in the past several months due partially to the government’s deleveraging efforts,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “We’re going to see strong headwinds in the second half.”
More than 40 percent of businesses complained about labor and input prices, showing higher costs remain a major difficulty, the bureau said. An input prices sub-index rose to 56.7 from 53 a month earlier.
“On the back of the concern about a slowing economy and the need to prioritize expanding domestic demand, the government has also been taking measures to boost infrastructure spending and front-load budgeted projects since a few weeks ago,” Chang Jian, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
The World Bank said in a report released Thursday that external risks for China have become more prominent and high corporate debt is the main domestic challenge. Bank economists maintained their forecast for the expansion to decelerate to 6.5 percent this year.
The strong PMI reading should offer some relief for those concerned about an economic slowdown, according to Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“An outperforming first half can offer a buffer for China to deal with global uncertainties including a potential softening of European demand and Trump’s ad hoc measures,” he said.

4,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>","Japan's factory output growth slumps in April, dims production prospects","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output was well short of market expectations in April, official figures showed on Thursday, adding to fears for the outlook after the economy contracted in the first quarter. 
Industrial output rose just 0.3 percent in April from the previous month, official data showed on Thursday, well below the median forecast for a 1.2 percent increase and a 1.4 percent rise in March.
Much of the slowdown was due to a 5.6 percent decline in production of electronic parts while inventories rose for a third straight month, adding to fears of weakening overseas demand.
Output is seen likely to weaken further as companies focus on lowering inventories of unsold goods, suggesting Japan's economic performance peaked last year and this year growth will be more modest.
""Production is slowing overall because companies with high inventories are cutting their output,"" said Asuka Sakamoto, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Output will fall in the coming months, but I expect consumer spending to rebound in the second quarter, which should be supportive for economic growth. I'm not worried about a recession.""
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expected output to rise 0.3 percent in May but to fall 0.8 percent in June.
Japan's economy contracted in the first quarter as weak investment, consumption and exports took their toll, with Thursday's output data and forecasts adding to concerns over how quickly the economy can return to growth.

On the positive side, production of cars and machines used in factories accelerated in April.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through May 21, showed the U.S. economy and inflation expanded at a modest pace.
“Contacts noted some concern about the uncertainty of international trade policy. Still, outlooks for near term growth were generally upbeat,” according to the Fed’s beige book. “Economic activity expanded moderately in late April and early May with few shifts in the pattern of growth.”
Wage increases remained “modest” in most Districts, and some districts expected similar employment and wage gains in the coming months, according to the Fed’s beige book.
The modest pace of wage growth comes as many firms increased wages as well as the generosity of their compensation packages.
Manufacturing activity “shifted into higher gear,” the Fed said, with more than half of the Districts reporting a pickup in industrial activity and a third of the Districts classifying activity as ""strong.”
The Fed hinted at a faster pace of consumer inflation, citing ""some Districts also noted that their retail contacts were more able to pass along price increases to their customers than in the recent past.”
Analysts at BMO said the ""harder data"" was yet to validate the Fed's ""fairly positive,"" view of price pressures building and modest wage gains.
""While the release offers a fairly positive view of price pressures building and of labor shortages flowing through to 'modest' wage gains, we've yet to see that dynamic play out in harder data,"" BMO said.
The release of the Beige book did little to shift the narrative on monetary policy, drawing a muted reaction in markets, as traders continued to expect the Federal Reserve will hike rates at its next meeting in June.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, about 85% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates in June."
6,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2018 12:24PM ET</span>",U.S. first-quarter growth trimmed on weak consumer spending,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the first quarter as consumer spending rose at its weakest pace in nearly five years, but activity is already picking up against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and tax cuts. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in its second estimate of first-quarter GDP, instead of the previously reported 2.3 percent pace. While business spending was stronger than initially estimated, inventory investment was far smaller than the government reported last month.
The economy grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Economists expect a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January, will spur faster economic growth this year and lift annual GDP growth close to the Trump administration's 3 percent target.
Growth is also expected to get a boost from increased government spending. April data including retail sales, trade and industrial production suggest the economy regained speed early in the second quarter. Growth estimates for the second quarter are above a 3 percent rate.
Economists had expected first-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 2.3 percent pace. 
""Growth is set to rev up soon given the deficit-financed tax cuts and a big increase in federal government spending,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2.8 percent rate in the January-March quarter, the fastest since the third quarter of 2016. GDI rose at a 1.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.5 percent rate in the first quarter. That followed a 2.0 percent rate of growth in the prior period.
The income side of the growth ledger was boosted by after-tax corporate profits, which surged at a 5.9 percent rate last quarter after rising at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective January. 
Wages and salaries also got a lift from lower tax rates, increasing $119.5 billion in the first quarter, an upward revision of $3.1 billion from earlier estimates.
STRONG LABOR MARKET 
Separately, the ADP national employment report on Wednesday showed private sector payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs in May after rising 163,000 in April. The data was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 188,000 jobs this month after gaining 164,000 in April. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a near 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.
""Job growth is still strong for this stage of the expansion but slowing as businesses are having a difficult time finding qualified workers to fill open positions,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Steady growth and a robust labor market are seen encouraging the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in March and forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors keep a wary eye on political developments in Italy. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower. Stocks on Wall Street rose.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked to a 1.0 percent rate in the first quarter, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent pace. It was the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013 and followed the fourth quarter's robust 4.0 percent rate. 
Businesses accumulated inventories at a $20.2 billion rate, instead of the $33.1 billion pace estimated last month. Inventory investment contributed 0.13 percentage point to GDP growth instead of 0.43 percentage point. The smaller inventory build bodes well for second-quarter GDP growth.
The trade deficit in the first three months of the year was a bit bigger than initially thought and had no impact on the GDP growth rate. Trade was previously estimated to have added 0.20 percentage point to output. 
It could contribute to GDP growth in the second quarter as another report from the Commerce Department showed the goods trade deficit falling 0.6 percent to $68.2 billion in April.
Business spending on equipment was revised up to a 5.5 percent growth rate in the January-March quarter from the 4.7 percent pace estimated last month. That was still a moderation in investment following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. April durable goods data suggested business spending on equipment is likely to slow further in the second quarter.

Investment in homebuilding fell at a 2.0 percent rate in the first quarter instead of being unchanged as reported last month.

8,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2018 08:56AM ET</span>",German inflation overshoots ECB target in May,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation soared more than expected in May, propelled by higher energy costs to its highest level in more than a year and surpassing the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole.
German consumer prices, harmonized to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.2 percent year-on-year after an increase of 1.4 percent the month before, the Federal Statistics Office said.
This was the fastest pace since February 2017 and beat a Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 1.8 percent.
On the month, EU-harmonized prices were up 0.6 percent, the preliminary numbers showed. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for an increase of 0.3 percent.
""German inflation is now showing its true colors,"" KfW bank economist Joerg Zeuner said, adding that a rate of around 2 percent reflected Germany's strong upswing.
""It supports the ECB's path to cautiously exit its unconventional monetary policy,"" Zeuner added.
In another sign of accelerating inflation in the euro zone, Spanish consumer prices rose in May at their fastest pace since April 2017, also topping the ECB's target level as energy costs went up.
The stronger-than-expected inflation figures are likely to play into the hands of policy hawks, including Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann, who want the ECB to end its asset purchases this year and see room for a rate hike towards the middle of 2019.
But investors have dropped long-standing bets that the ECB would raise rates in June 2019 amid signs of weaker economic growth in the euro zone and market turmoil associated with a political crisis in Italy.
In Portugal, annual consumer price inflation rose to 1.0 percent in May, up from 0.4 percent in the previous month, data from the National Statistics Institute showed on Wednesday.
The euro zone will publish preliminary May inflation data on Thursday, with the annual rate expected to rise to 1.6 percent from 1.2 percent in April, according to a Reuters poll.
The German statistics office did not provide a preliminary reading for core inflation. But regional data from the states suggested that higher prices for energy, food and transport were the main drivers of the surge in May.
""The ECB now faces a classic stagflationary shock, with higher inflation and slower growth,"" Oxford Economics analyst Nicola Nobile said.

She added, however, that she still expected the ECB to end its bond purchases this year, to avoid the risk of second-round effects on inflation.

9,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. First-Quarter Growth Revised Down to 2.2% on Inventories,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy grew in the first quarter at a slightly slower pace than previously estimated, while tax cuts gave a significant boost to corporate profits, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday.
Key Takeaways
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, was revised downward due to smaller contributions from services. At the same time, another key gauge of the economy was better than previously reported: Final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out trade and inventories -- the two most volatile components of the GDP calculation -- advanced 1.9 percent, revised up from 1.6 percent.
The first quarter typically is influenced by seasonal quirks. Household purchases and economic growth are projected to rebound in the April-June period amid bigger after-tax paychecks and the strong job market. However, a sustained and more pronounced rise in fuel costs would potentially restrain gains in consumer spending and business investment.
The report included the first look at corporate America’s earnings in early 2018, indicating a big impact on companies’ bottom lines from the Republican-backed tax cuts that took effect Jan. 1. While the pretax annual gain was in line with recent quarters, the after-tax increase was the biggest since late 2016, as a cut in the tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent resulted in a $117.4 billion quarterly drop in corporate income taxes.
Price data showed inflation was slower than previously estimated. Excluding food and energy, the Federal Reserve’s preferred price index that is tied to personal spending rose at a 2.3 percent annualized rate, revised from a previously- estimated 2.5 percent pace. The central bank targets 2 percent annual gains in the gauge including all items.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2% annual rate in the first three months of 2018, instead of the previously reported 2.3% pace, the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate.
That was a deceleration from the fourth quarter's brisk 2.9% pace.
Consumer spending was revised down to 1.0% from 1.1% initially, acting as a drag on growth.
Exports were also revised down to 4.2% from 4.8% while imports were revised slightly higher, to 2.8% from 2.6% in the initial estimate.
Despite the slowdown, the U.S. economy is currently in its second longest economic expansion since World War II.
The first quarter data is unlikely to have much of an impact on the Federal Reserve plans for gradual tightening given the expected boost over the coming months from the Trump administration tax cuts which took effect in January.
Minutes of the Fed’s May meeting published earlier this month showed that policymakers forecast the expansion to “pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through 2020”.
Policymakers expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary and noted “a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad.”
The Fed funds futures market currently implies that there is a 82.5% chance of the central bank lifting interest rates next month, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, and investors are pricing an additional rate hike before the end of the year.
The third estimate for first quarter GDP will be released on June 28, while preliminary data for the second quarter is due on July 27."

The consumer price index rose 2.2% in May, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office.
Economists had expected annual inflation to increase 2.0% after rising 1.6% in April.
Consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, rose by 2.2% from the previous year, above forecasts for a reading of 1.8% and compared to a gain of 1.4% in the previous month.
The rise was mainly driven by higher energy, food and transport prices.
The data pointed to robust consumer demand, feeding into a debate about when the European Central Bank should curb its monetary stimulus.

A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested that Germany's harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP) rate would rise to 1.8 percent in May.
In another sign of rising inflation in the euro zone, Spanish consumer prices rose in May at their fastest pace since April 2017, also topping the ECB's target level.
The euro zone will publish preliminary May inflation data on Thursday, with the annual rate expected to rise to 1.6 percent from 1.2 percent in April, according to a Reuters poll.

""The ECB now faces a classic stagflationary shock, with higher inflation and slower growth,"" Nobile said, adding she still expected the ECB to end quantitative easing this year in order to avoid the risk of second round effects on inflation.

EU-harmonised prices rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year, Wednesday's flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed, compared with a consensus forecast of 1.7 percent and a April reading of 1.1 percent.
Spain is the first large euro zone economy to report consumer prices for May. Germany will also publish figures on Wednesday that expected to show a jump to 2 percent.
Weak inflation across the euro zone has encouraged the central bank to keep interest rates at record lows.
Headline consumer prices are expected to be above the ECB's target of just below 2 percent this summer, but the bank's preferred measure is the core rate, which strips out volatile oil and food prices and has been consistently lower.
Inflation expectations together with economic growth, which has turned more sluggish, are also variables in the ECB's plans for its bond-buying scheme, which it is expected to end later this year.
Spain's national consumer price index rose by 2.0 percent, INE said, up from 1.1 percent in April, also the highest since April last year.

15,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",German jobless rate hits record low in May,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's jobless numbers dropped more than expected in May, pushing down the unemployment rate to a record low, data showed on Wednesday, reflecting the robustness of a labor market that has become a key driver of a consumer-led upswing.
The Federal Labor Office said the seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.358 million. That compared with an expected drop of 10,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in May, the Office said. That was the lowest since German reunification in 1990.
""Unemployment and underemployment have decreased again, employment within the scope of the social security system keeps rising and labor demand is still high,"" Labor Office head Detlef Scheele said in a statement.
""The upward trend on the labor market is continuing, albeit at a slower pace than in the winter months,"" he added.
The rock-solid labor market is likely to further boost consumer confidence and household spending in Europe's biggest economy, which has seen domestic demand overtake exports as the main growth driver in recent years.

The board of governors lifted Bank Indonesia's (BI) key rate <IDCBRR=ECI> by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent in the first meeting led by Governor Perry Warjiyo, who promised to make rupiah stability a near-term priority.
""Our policy direction in the future is BI will continue to calibrate global and domestic market developments to utilize room for further rate hikes in a measured way,"" Warjiyo told reporters.
On May 26, one day after being sworn-in for a five-year term, Warjiyo called Wednesday's off-cycle meeting. Comments by government officials on Monday convinced nearly all analysts that BI would increase rates on Wednesday's session, the first special one called since November 2014, when rates were hiked.
All but one of 18 analysts in a Reuters Poll expected an increase on Wednesday.
Stephen innes, head of Asia-Pacific currency trading at , OANDA, said Wednesday's decision showed ""currency first and nothing else really matters"".
The rupiah, one of the worst performers among Asian currencies this year, barely moved following the rate announcement. It was trading at about 13,985 per dollar at the time it was made.
PAST MONETARY EASING
BI had already raised its key rate by 25 basis points on May 17 to shore up the currency, then trading at its weakest since October 2015.
In 2016 and 2017, BI cut the benchmark rate by a total of 200 bps in a bid to boost sluggish lending and economic growth. But annual growth has stayed at about 5 percent.
On Monday, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said ""We are ready to take any kind of policy to support Indonesia's economy,"" adding that if short-term measures mean slightly lower growth, ""then that consequence has to be accepted"".
The government has a 2018 growth target of 5.4 percent. BI expects 5.2 percent, better than last year's 5.07 percent.
Indrawati and other senior officials on Monday sought to shore up confidence in Southeast Asia's biggest economy at a time Indonesia, like other emerging markets, has seen an outflow of funds as U.S. assets become more attractive due to rising interest rates.
Officials note that key economic indicators are sound. The annual inflation rate is seen at 3.6 percent at the end of 2018, while the current account deficit is expected at 2.3 percent of GDP - below BI's ""healthy"" threshold of 3 percent.

17,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2018 02:52AM ET</span>",German retail sales rebound with bigger-than-expected jump in April,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose more than expected in April after four consecutive monthly drops, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that household spending will support growth in Europe's biggest economy in the second quarter.
Private consumption has become a key growth driver in recent years as German consumers benefit from record-high employment, rising real wages, strong job security, moderate inflation and low borrowing costs.
The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, showed retail sales rose by 2.3 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said.
It was the strongest monthly increase since October 2016 and beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.7 percent rise. It followed an upwardly revised drop of 0.4 percent in March.
On the year, retail rose by 1.2 percent, slightly weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.3 percent increase.
A breakdown of the year-on-year data showed sharp increases in sales of clothing, shoes and other items such as books and jewellery. Online retail sales also surged.
The retail sales data came after a GfK survey published last week showed the mood among German consumers deteriorated further heading into June to reach the lowest level so far in 2018.
Household spending contributed 0.2 percentage points to a quarterly gross domestic product expansion rate of 0.3 percent in the first quarter.

Despite uncertainties sparked by the prospect of a trade dispute between Europe and the United States, the government expects consumers to remain a key pillar of support for the economy this year. Berlin forecasts 2.3 percent growth for 2018.

18,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","China's Economy Is Battling Slowdown, Earliest Indicators Show","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy is refusing to slow down without a fight.
That’s the picture that emerges this month from a new gauge of economic activity developed by Fielding Chen at Bloomberg Economics, which aggregates the earliest available indicators into one reading for the first time.
While an ongoing campaign to curb financial excess and deflate property bubbles is taking its toll on some parts of the economy, the damage is being mitigated by industry benefiting from increased pricing power and the recent strength of global trade, the dashboard shows.
The dashboard brings together eight readings from China’s trade partners, smaller businesses, sales managers, real estate, stocks and commodities to give an under-the-hood look at activity in the world’s second-largest economy, independent from -- and before -- the official data.
The gauge is based on the three-month weighted average of the changes of these indicators, smoothing out volatility in the single-month readings. A full dashboard, with five additional indicators, including the official purchasing manager indexes due May 31, plus South Korea exports, will be available from Bloomberg Economics early next month.
A moderation in the pace of growth for the world’s second-largest economy has been on the cards for some time, given 2017’s out-performance and the short-term costs of the effort to clean-up the financial sector. On the back of that concern, policy makers have acted to reassure that growth won’t slow too sharply, with the People’s Bank of China cutting reserve requirements in April.
Combined PMI reports from the European Union, the U.S. and Japan point to a moderate slowdown, as do prices of real estate stocks and iron ore. Meanwhile, a survey of smaller companies and a tracker of factory inflation are still holding up.
Corporate profitability is also a bright spot that could carry momentum in the economy for longer than anticipated. Industrial profit growth accelerated to 21.9 percent in April from a year earlier. That, plus signs that leading trade indicators like South Korea exports are headed for a strong performance, create some room for optimism.
Here are the full details on the dashboard’s dials:
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see a 6.5 percent expansion this year after 6.9 percent in 2017, in line with the government’s own target.
The early indicators offer signals of a slowdown underway, not a definitive account. Factories might still be humming along, even while demand from the property sector and the rest of the world starts to lose steam. Industrial indicators for April surprised to the upside, though trade indicators in the month’s PMI readings softened.
The dashboard data based on real-time market prices and business surveys depict more of the on-the-ground situation in the private sector, while the official gauges tend to lean towards the state sector, Chen said.
“The surprising strength in factory activities in April may not be sustained a few months down the road,” Chen said, adding that the activities will be more in line with the slowing property, infrastructure and consumption demand. “We are expecting a gradual slowdown this year.”

19,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence rebounds, house prices increase","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer confidence rebounded in May, but households were a bit pessimistic about their short-term income prospects even as they expected strong job growth to persist, which could restrain consumer spending.
The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index rose 2.4 points to a reading of 128.0 this month from a downwardly revised 125.6 in April. The index was previously reported at 128.7 in April. 
""If consumers don't step up their spending ... then the growth outlook this year may disappoint on the weak side,"" said Chris Rupkey chief economist at MUFG in New York.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid a deepening political crisis in Italy. The dollar rose to a 10-month high against the euro, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street dropped, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average touching near three-week lows. 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 26.6 in May, the best reading since May 2001, from 22.7 in April.
That measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, suggests that labor market slack continues to shrink.
But consumers were less upbeat about their short-term income prospects. The share of consumers expecting an improvement in their income fell to 21.3 percent this month from 21.8 percent in April. The proportion expecting a decrease rose to 8.2 percent in May from 7.9 percent in the prior month.
BUYING PLANS DROP
The weak income readings are despite massive tax cuts which the Trump administration claimed would boost paychecks for American workers. The $1.5 trillion tax cut package came into effect in January.
Consumers also showed a reluctance to commit to purchases of big-ticket items this month, with intentions to buy automobiles, houses and appliances declining. Consumer spending braked sharply in the first quarter and there are signs that it picked up early in the April-June period.
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 0.5 percent in March after rising 0.8 percent in February. House prices gained 6.8 percent in the 12 months to March after rising by the same margin in February.
The solid gains are at odds with recent data which had suggested a cooling in house prices. The Federal Housing Finance Agency reported last week that house prices edged up 0.1 percent in March from February. 
The regulator's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
""While the weakness in the FHFA house price data raised some concerns that the trend in house price appreciation had started to shift lower, so far, the Case-Shiller data do not support that view,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The house price inflation is being fueled by an acute shortage of homes available for sale, which is hurting the housing market.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence increased to 128.0 this month, compared to a reading of 128.2 forecast by economists.
April’s reading was revised down to 125.6 from the initial 128.7.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The Present Situation Index increased from 157.5 to 161.7, while the Expectations Index improved from 104.3 last month to 105.6 this month.
“Consumer confidence increased in May after a modest decline in April,” Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
Franco noted that consumers’ assessment of current conditions increased to a 17-year high, suggesting that the level of economic growth in the second quarter is likely to have improved from the first three months of the year.
“Consumers’ short-term expectations improved modestly, suggesting that the pace of growth over the coming months is not likely to gain any significant momentum,” she added.
“Overall, confidence levels remain at historically strong levels and should continue to support solid consumer spending in the near-term,” Franco concluded."

The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group said its monthly ""euro break-up"" index, based on a survey of around 1,000 institutional and retail investors, more than doubled to 13 percent from 6.3 percent in April.
""The turmoil over the Italian government formation, in which the euro-critical parties League and 5-Star want to form an alliance, has alarmed the bond markets,"" Sentix researcher Manfred Huebner said.
A sub-index on Italy showed that 11.3 percent of investors expected the third-biggest euro zone economy to leave the single currency bloc, up from 3.6 percent in the previous month.
The overall headline figure was far below the survey's record levels of more than 70 percent reached during the euro zone debt crisis in 2012.
Sentix said it conducted the survey from May 24-26.
Italy's anti-establishment forces abandoned their efforts to form a ruling coalition on Sunday after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella, who vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic as economy minister.
Mattarella set the country on a path to fresh elections on Monday, appointing a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister with the task of planning for snap polls and passing the next budget.

22,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Euro zone lending growth levels off,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lending growth to euro zone households and companies held steady in April while a broader indicator of money circulating in the currency bloc, which often foreshadows future activity, rebounded, European Central Bank data showed on Tuesday.
Lending to non-financial corporations expanded by 3.3 percent in April while household lending grew by 2.9 percent, both unchanged from the previous month, the ECB said in a regular monthly statement.
Buying around 2.5 trillion euro worth of debt in the past three years, the ECB has labored away to depress borrowing costs and kick start lending, all in the hope of rekindling growth and inflation.
While its efforts have mostly paid off, growth has softened in recent months, raising concerns that the ECB could struggle to remove stimulus, particularly if political uncertainty in Italy dents investor sentiment and causes borrowing costs to rise.
Lending growth, which accelerated for most of last year has also appeared to level off this year, holding well below its pre-crisis mark and indicating that the bank sector is still far from healthy.
Weighed down by bad debt often a decades old, many lenders remain reluctant to lend to the real economy while they struggle to repair their balance sheets.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, seen by some as a precursor of economic activity, rose to 3.9 percent in April from 3.7 percent a month earlier, in line with expectations for 3.9 percent. But its rate is still well below the 4.2 percent growth recorded in February.

23,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",China's May manufacturing growth seen dipping only marginally,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's vast manufacturing sector is expected to have dipped but only marginally in May, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy as fears of a trade war with the United States ebbed. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is seen slipping to 51.3 in May from 51.4 in April, according to the median forecast of 30 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
That would mark the 22 straight month of expansion for China's manufacturing sector, and reinforce consensus views that the economy will slow only modestly this year, good news for policymakers as they try to navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with Washington.
Last week, Washington and Beijing both claimed victory as the world's two largest economies stepped back from the brink of a global trade war and agreed to hold further talks to boost U.S. exports to China. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will visit China this weekend for another round of talks.
Economic data for April had painted a mixed picture for China's economy, with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low and growth in retail sales sliding. 
However, the industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained healthy with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.
China has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but does not want to cut off funding to the real economy. It has cut electricity prices for industrial users by about 7 percent so far this year.
Separately, a private survey on China's factory activity is forecast to show a similar easing trend, with some analysts warning that a growing number of credit defaults is pointing to mounting pressure on small and medium-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from a year-long construction boom as their larger, state-owned peers.
The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) is expected to have fallen slightly to 51.0 in May versus 51.1 in April.
New export orders in the Caixin PMI shrank for the first time in over a year in April as firms remained cautious of uncertain external demand.
The official PMI survey is due out on May 31, along with a similar official survey on services.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on June 1, and the Caixin services PMI on June 5.

Despite a better-than-expected first-quarter, economists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.[ECILT/CN]

27,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",China Industrial Profit Growth Accelerates on Higher Output,"(Bloomberg) -- Profit growth at Chinese industrial companies accelerated, snapping a streak of slowing expansion since October, as factory output remained robust.
Industrial profits advanced 21.9 percent in April from a year earlier, versus a 3.1 percent increase in March and 16.1 percent in January and February combined. Total profits for the month were 576.03 billion yuan ($90.1 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday.
The acceleration was bolstered by higher output, rebounding factory inflation and improved profit margins particularly in the steel, chemical and auto industries, the bureau said in a separate statement. Industrial output climbed 7 percent last month, exceeding forecasts, though decelerating investment and retail sales signal a looming economic slowdown.
“The notable recovery in industrial enterprise profitability in April indicates that China’s domestic growth remains resilient,” Eva Yi, senior economist at China International Capital Corp. in Hong Kong, said in a research note. Meanwhile, there are some “early signs of stress from the recent changes in the industrial enterprise balance sheet.”
China’s supply-side reform continues to help cut industrial companies’ costs and leverage, the bureau said. The nation’s total industrial profits in the first fourth months climbed 15 percent from a year earlier to 2.13 trillion yuan, Sunday’s data showed.

28,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",China April industrial profit growth rebounds to six-month high,"(This story corrects typographic error in 14th paragraph)
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in April rose at their fastest pace in six months, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday, as factories benefited from higher prices and strong demand.
Profits in April rose 21.9 percent year-on-year to 576 billion yuan ($90.14 billion), the quickest since October, bringing gains for the first four months of 2018 to 15 percent.
The data suggests China's industrial sector is still seeing solid growth momentum despite curbs on pollution and rocky trade relations with the United States.
Last month's rebound was helped by lower comparison figures for April 2017, higher factory prices and stronger demand, He Ping, head of NBS' industrial division, said in a statement.
It was a significant improvement over March's 3.1 percent growth that was the slowest in over a year and which government officials had blamed on the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.
The higher April data should help ease concerns of slowing momentum in China's economy as the country implements tougher pollution controls on ""smokestack"" industries and cash-strapped regional governments cut back on big investment projects, curbing demand for building materials.
Profit growth for Chinese industrial firms has softened from last year's strong pace as factory gate price gains weaken. In the first four months of 2017, profits rose 24.4 percent.
China's producer price inflation picked up to 3.4 percent in April from March but was much lower than 6.4 percent in the year-ago period. 
Weaker profit growth suggests companies may be reluctant to invest and hire new staff, while making it harder for debt-laden firms to service their debt, especially state-owned enterprises that account for the bulk of the country's high leverage.
A Reuters analysis showed that debt growth for Chinese companies has slowed to the lowest rate in more than a decade, but companies have also seen profit margins squeezed to their lowest level in two years.
April economic data had shown signs of slowing momentum as investment growth touched a near 20-year low and retail sales growth weakened. 
Despite stronger-than-expected first-quarter economic growth, economists polled by Reuters still expect a gradual slowdown to around 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, as rising borrowing costs weigh on consumption and investment.
Beijing continues to call for tighter controls on risky investments and speculation in the property sector, but does not want to cut off funding to firms in the ""real economy"" such as manufacturing firms that are a key source of jobs. 
There have also been signs that policymakers have moved to a slightly looser stance as they look to ensure growth doesn't slow too much, while also keeping financial risks under control.
STEEL SECTOR LEADS REBOUND
April's rebound was led by the steel, chemicals and automobile industries, said He, as profits for iron and steel processing firms rose 260 percent in April.
No industrial sectors recorded year-on-year losses over January to April, the data showed.
But earnings in the computer and telecommunications sector fell 5.3 percent over the four months, though that was a slight improvement from an 11 percent decline in the first quarter.
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 6.1 percent year-on-year as of end-April, according to the statistics bureau.
Profits at China's state-owned firms rose 26.2 percent to 627 billion yuan for Jan-April, compared with a 23.1 percent rise in the first quarter.
The data includes companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan ($3.13 million) from their main operations.

Canada posted a deficit of C$16.19 billion ($12.48 billion) in the fiscal year that ended in March, down from a deficit of C$21.85 billion the year before.
While that was also smaller than the C$19.4 billion deficit in 2017-18 that the government predicted in its February budget, the figures do not account for year-end adjustments or planned spending on veterans' benefits, the finance department said.
Taking those adjustments into account, the figures are ""broadly in line"" with the expected deficit for the fiscal year, the report said.
Revenue rose 5.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year on increased income from personal and corporate taxes and outpacing a 3.5 percent increase in program expenses.

The budget deficit for March was C$10.63 billion, slightly wider than the C$10.39 billion reported in March 2017. While revenue was up in the month, so was spending on program expenses.

An economist at Ifo said the domestic economy, particularly trade, construction and services, had been largely responsible for the stabilization, while there was ""no euphoria"" in the export sector which has historically propelled the economy.
""The downward trend has stopped,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters. ""The global economic environment is difficult, but the German economy is holding its ground.""
But Andreas Scheuerle, economist at DekaBank, disagreed, saying the trend had not yet changed and added: ""The news that is currently raining down on companies really does not lend itself to creating a positive mood.""
He pointed to the possibility of U.S. import tariffs on autos and concerns about Italy's new government, and said that news had come toward the end of the survey period so would not weigh on the index until next month.
Illustrating the challenging international environment for German exporters, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), which makes everything from chemical plants and car parts to submarines and steel, last week cut the profit margin forecast for its capital goods business, blaming a strong euro and higher material costs.
GROWTH ON LAST LEG?
Germany, a major exporter, faces a host of risks including the prospect of U.S. import tariffs on aluminum and steel, a potential global trade war and the possibility that German firms conducting business in Iran will face sanctions after the U.S. decision to back out of the nuclear deal with Tehran.
""The number of dark clouds in the German economic sky has clearly increased,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, pointing to higher oil prices, trade tensions and Italian politics.
""Add to this the political reluctance to speed up new structural reforms and both public and private investments and it becomes obvious that the German growth story is running on its last leg.""
But Stephen Brown at Capital Economics was more optimistic, saying the stabilization was encouraging and gave reason to hope economic growth might pick up to 0.6 percent in the second quarter. 
Other recent data has painted a negative picture, showing private sector growth at its lowest in more than 1-1/2 years, investor morale remaining at its weakest level in more than five years and the mood among consumers hitting its lowest this year.
Economic output slowed to 0.3 percent in the first quarter, down from 0.6 percent in late 2017 but the finance ministry says the economy is still in a strong upswing.
The government expects a 2.3 percent expansion this year but the Bundesbank says underlying economic momentum is likely to have weakened.
The Ifo survey showed that German managers were more satisfied with their current business situation but felt more downbeat about their prospects for the coming months.
A breakdown showed sentiment deteriorating in the manufacturing sector while it picked up in services, trade and construction.

LONDON (Reuters) - Already facing a likely growth slowdown, the euro zone risks a sudden tightening of financial conditions next month should banks across the bloc use the opportunity to repay billions of euros in cheap loans taken from the European Central Bank.
Such repayments could in turn boost the euro and the bloc's borrowing costs, an unwelcome development for policymakers after data this week signaled economic growth probably failed to pick up in the second quarter of the year.
June brings the first early repayment date for almost 400 billion euros ($471 billion) of targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), designed by the European Central Bank to encourage lending to the real economy. 
A first series of TLTROs was launched in 2014, and a second in 2016. They provided banks with interest-free funding and even the possibility of a rebate if they lent the cash on to businesses and households. 
The loans had a four-year maturity, with a quarterly option to repay early from two years after the loan was taken out.
Early repayments for the first series of TLTROs fell due in 2016 and most of those loans were rolled over into the second series, analysts said. 
According to Swedish bank Nordea, early TLTRO repayments in June could top 110 billion euros. 
That estimate is based on a comparison with 2013, when unexpected early repayments of a previous series of cheap three-year loans totaling 137 billion euros offered by the ECB to help fight the euro zone debt crisis caught markets by surprise.
To view a graphic on The ECB's balance sheet, click: https://reut.rs/2Lq5j8W 
Other banks' estimates put the expected figure for next month in the region of 100 billion euros. 
The ECB declined to comment on repayment expectations.
Peter Kinsella, head of currency and rates strategy at CBA, sees two reasons why banks will repay a sizeable portion of the TLTRO loans.
First, they no longer require the same degree of central bank support. CBA estimates that the average Tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of a bank's financial strength, is around 14 percent versus 8 percent before the 2008 financial crisis.
The recovery in euro zone banks was highlighted by first quarter earnings -- 85 percent of banks in the MSCI EMU index met or beat analyst expectations, according to I/B/E/S data.
Second, CBA says that because various regulatory levies faced by banks are proportional to the size of their balance sheets, early repayment of ECB loans will help reduce that balance sheet and in turn potential charges. 
""If euro zone banks voluntarily repay a significant proportion ... we anticipate front-end euro zone yields may lift aggressively, because the early repayment implies a tightening of monetary conditions,"" said Kinsella. 
European Commission data shows euro area monetary conditions have already tightened in recent months, partly because of the euro's strength at the start of 2018 and throughout last year.
A further tightening could take investors by surprise. 
German two-year bond yields remain deeply negative, at minus 0.61 percent (DE2YT=RR).
Some strategists said that while early TLTRO repayments was not their base-case for June, this could happen in September -- the banks' next opportunity to pay back the ECB early. 
Traders say there were few immediate concerns about early loan repayments being made -- especially since interest rates at minus 0.4 percent for two more years under the TLTRO remain attractive, and potentially shelter banks from a rate rise over that period.
Also, many banks are believed to be still assessing what they might do.
One strategist said it made financial sense for banks to start repaying these loans only when the maturity of the loans drops to a year because after that they become less attractive to hold. 
Also, even if banks decide to repay their loans early, the ECB will still continue its 30 billion euros a month of bond purchases until September at least. That means its balance sheet will still be expanding and pumping cash into the economy.
For Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich, though, these ECB purchases may not be big enough to offset the impact of early TLTRO repayments. 
""Given that the ECB is on the final stretch of its net bond purchases, the remaining bond purchases may never be able to compensate for the flow of early TLTRO repayments,"" he said.
""The ECB's balance sheet could start to contract well before the first rate hike and even before the end of the net bond purchases.""
This would stand in contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which did not let its balance sheet start contracting until more than 1-1/2 years after its first post-crisis rate hike, he said.
For others, the incentive to pay back loans early was linked to facing up to the reality of the changing monetary policy backdrop globally. 

""This is not an issue for right now, but it could be later in the year as central banks globally tighten their policies -- essentially the unwinding of global QE,"" said Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Existing home sales fell 2.5% in April from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.46 million units.
Economists had forecasts a 0.2% decrease to an annualized pace of 5.56 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.
NAR indicated that sales also slid 1.4% on an annualized basis as all four major regions saw no gain in sales activity last month.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun explained that the slump was due to extremely low inventory levels.
“The root cause of the underperforming sales activity in much of the country so far this year continues to be the utter lack of available listings on the market to meet the strong demand for buying a home,” he said.
“Inventory shortages are even worse than in recent years, and home prices keep climbing above what many home shoppers are able to afford,” Yun added.
According to the report, the median existing-home price for all housing types in April was $257,900, up 5.3% from April 2017 ($245,000)."
38,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>",Tight supply weighs on U.S. home sales; job market strengthening,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales tumbled in April as an acute shortage of properties limited choices for potential buyers, the latest sign that the housing market was struggling to regain momentum.
While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, the trend in claims continued to point to a tightening labor market. A robust labor market is fueling demand for housing.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units last month. The NAR attributed April's weak sales to an ""utter lack of available listings on the market to meet the strong demand for buying a home.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, declining only 0.2 percent last month. April's drop followed two straight monthly increases. 
Sales fell 1.4 percent on a year-on-year basis in April.
While the number of previously owned homes on the market increased 9.8 percent from the prior month to 1.80 million units in April, housing inventory was down 6.3 percent from a year ago. Supply has declined for 35 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 26 days in April, the fewest since the NAR started tracking the series in May 2011. That was down from 30 days in March and 29 days a year ago. Fifty-seven percent of homes sold in April were on the market for less than a month.
With inventory tight, the median house price increased 5.3 percent from a year ago to $257,900 in April. That was the 74th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested news that U.S. President Donald Trump had canceled a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES
House price increases have far outpaced wage gains - annual wage growth has remained below 3 percent. Economists said there was no sign yet that rising mortgage rates were having an impact on home sales. They, however, cautioned that higher borrowing costs could worsen the housing shortage.
""But rising rates may be making homeowners less likely to sell because they could be trading a very low mortgage on their existing home for a higher one on another home,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. 
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate averaged 4.61 percent in the week ended May 17, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. That compared to an average of 4.55 percent in the previous week.
The weak existing home sales report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a 1.5 percent drop in new home sales in April. Investment in homebuilding was unchanged in the first quarter.
""Early on in our tracking of the second-quarter housing data, it looks like real residential investment will decline during the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Given labor market strength and rising inflation, economists said the sluggish housing market was unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month.
Minutes of the Fed's May 1-2 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed most officials believed ""that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate ... to take another step in removing policy accommodation.""
The Fed raised borrowing costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended May 19. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 220,000 in the latest week.
The labor market is viewed as being close to or at full employment, with the jobless rate near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent. The unemployment rate is within striking distance of the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 6,250 to 219,750 last week.

""The labor market is undoubtedly in good health,"" said Kathryn Asher, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 3,000 to 220,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 219,750, up 6,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The rate of expansion from a year earlier gave the trade ministry enough confidence to narrow its growth forecast for 2018 to 2.5 to 3.5 percent, from a prior range of 1.5 to 3.5 percent. Manufacturing showed particular strength while construction expanded on an annual basis for the first time in a year.
Steady growth that’s within the government’s forecast range, coupled with data earlier this week showing inflation comfortably within target, should support the central bank’s plans to gradually tighten monetary policy this year. The government remains on guard for negative effects stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions and a global trend of rising interest rates.
“They already got their first tightening in, in April -- I don’t think they’re going to be in a rush,” Selena Ling, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said of the MAS officials. She sees the chance of further tightening at the October MAS meeting versus a hold in the policy stance as around 50-50, with signs now that Japan and some key economies in Europe could be slowing down.
A surge in electronics demand underpinned the city state’s 3.6 percent expansion last year, but as the export boom starts to moderate, GDP growth is set to ease to a more sustainable pace. The trade ministry expects growth to broaden out to other sectors of the economy this year, even as construction continues to lag.
“On balance, the pace of growth in the Singapore economy is expected to remain firm in 2018, with growth supported primarily by outward-oriented sectors,” the trade ministry said in its statement. Solid growth in electronics and precision engineering clusters, although more moderate this year, will help sustain manufacturing, it said.
While growth has been concentrated in export-related industries, it’s expected to broaden out to domestic-focused sectors this year, such as retail and food services, as the labor market improves, the ministry said. Construction will probably remain lackluster, it said, “as the earlier weakness in construction demand, particularly from the private sector, is expected to continue to weigh on construction activities this year.”
Compared with a year ago, construction fell 5 percent in the first quarter, after contracting 8.4 percent for the whole of 2017. Manufacturing climbed 9.8 percent in the first quarter, while the financial services industry surged 9.1 percent.
Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China is among the biggest risks to global growth and export-reliant Singapore. In addition, the ministry said the threat to emerging markets from rising U.S. interest rates is a key downside risk.
In a separate release, Enterprise Singapore maintained its forecast for non-oil exports to expand 1 percent to 3 percent this year.

The Fed kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 1.50% to 1.75% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on May 2 and stuck to its projections for two additional rate hikes this year.
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2% in March, warranting the need for further gradual rate hikes, the Fed's minutes showed.
""Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" according to Fed's minutes.
Fed officials also said that after an extended period of low inflation, the Committee's longer-run policy objective ""was to return inflation to its symmetric 2% goal on a sustained basis.""
The above-trend economic growth was underpinned by a number of factors including a strong labor market following a drop in the unemployment rate below 4% in April for the first time since 2000.
""A number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad,"" the minutes showed.
The report did little to alter the outlook for monetary policy, with the majority of traders expecting a rate hike at the Fed’s next meeting in June.
CIBC said the Fed minutes were somewhat dovish as the US central bank expressed ""tolerance for a bit of overshooting on the inflation front"" and did not appear too concerned about the prospect of an overheating economy.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 5.778 million barrels in the week ended May 18. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 1.567 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a decline of 1.3 million.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.123 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 438.1 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA indicated was “in the lower half of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 1.883 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 1.388 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 0.951 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 1.335 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. applications on mortgages to refinance an existing home fell to their lowest level in 17-1/2 years as some 30-year borrowing costs climbed to their highest levels in over seven years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.
Higher mortgage rates have pinched requests for mortgages to buy a home, although strong housing demand and tight supply have offset the rise in borrowing costs.
The Washington-based group for the U.S. mortgage industry seasonally adjusted measure on refinancing applications declined 3.7 percent to 1,018.1 in the week ended May 18, the lowest reading since December 2000.
The share of refinancing among weekly mortgage applications dipped to 35.7 percent from 35.9 percent the week before.
Refinancing ""might not come back for years,"" said Jonathan Corr, president and chief executive at Ellie Mae.
Demand from millennials, loosely defined as people born in the early 1980s to the 1990s, and lean housing supply will likely support home sales and prices for the foreseeable future. ""Demand is far outstripping supply,"" Corr said.
MBA's seasonally-adjusted gauge of home purchase applications fell 2 percent to 247.4, a six-week low.
The group's weekly barometer of total mortgage applications, adjusted for seasonal factors decreased 2.6 percent to 366.7, the lowest level since December.
Mortgage activity fell with rising home borrowing costs, which have moved in step with the increase in U.S. bond yields.
Expectations of faster economic growth and inflation since a sluggish first quarter have caused investors to reduce their bond holdings. Last Friday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) reached 3.128 percent, the highest since July 2011, according to Reuters data.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" home loans, whose balances are $453,100 or less, rose to 4.86 percent, the highest since April 2011. They averaged 4.77 percent the prior week, MBA said.
Fifteen-year mortgage rates averaged 4.31 percent last week, the highest level since February 2011.
Average interest rate on five-year adjustable-rate loans rose to 4.12 percent, the highest since the MBA began tracking it since 1990.
While rising mortgage rates have yet to cause a meaningful drop in home sales, they together with growing home prices have made it expensive for potential home buyers, said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance.
""There's some headwinds from higher mortgage rates,"" Liu said. ""Affordability is an issue for us in the longer run.""

45,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2018 01:09PM ET</span>","U.S. new home sales fall in April, housing market treading water","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell less than expected in April amid a rise in transactions in the South and Northeast, and data for the prior three months was revised lower, suggesting the housing market was struggling to regain momentum.
Economists said rising mortgage rates did not appear to be significantly hurting sales and blamed the drop in purchases on an acute shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.
Mortgage rates have climbed to seven-year highs as a healthy economy and tightening labor market fan fears of inflation and expectations of aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates in March and has forecast at least two more hikes for this year.
""New home sales are not showing signs of headlong retreat, so we know that higher interest rates have not really begun to bite yet and slow sales activity in a worrisome way,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales dropped 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 units last month. March's sales pace was revised down to 672,000 units from the previously reported 694,000 units. 
Home sales in February and January were not as strong as initially estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11 percent of housing market sales, falling 2.0 percent to a pace of 679,000 units in April.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 11.6 percent from a year ago. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher, outperforming a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
New home sales are benefiting from an inventory squeeze in the market for previously owned houses, which is constraining home resales. Builders have been unable to keep up with demand for housing, which is being driven by a robust labor market, citing expensive lumber as well as land and worker shortages.
RISING MORTGAGES
Tight inventories are pushing up house prices. Expensive houses and rising mortgage rates are making home purchasing less affordable, especially for first-time buyers who account for less than a third of transactions.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate averaged 4.61 percent in the week ended May 17, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. That compared to an average of 4.55 percent in the previous week.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to purchase a home declined 2 percent last week from the week prior. 
Investment in homebuilding was unchanged in the first quarter and economists are forecasting little or no growth in the April-June period.
Last month, new home sales rose 0.3 percent in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions. They rebounded 11.1 percent in the Northeast and were unchanged in the Midwest. Sales in the West dropped 7.9 percent in April. 
The median new house price rose 0.4 percent to $312,400 in April from a year ago. There were 300,000 new homes on the market in April, the most in nine years and up 0.7 percent from March. Supply is just over half of what it was as the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
""While the inventory of new homes for sale is relatively healthy, much of that stock is at the expensive end of the spectrum and therefore not much help for the majority of first-time buyers,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

The preliminary reading of the Markit services purchasing managers’ index came in at 55.7 this month, up down from 54.6 in April.
Economists had forecast a reading of 54.9.
The manufacturing PMI rose to 56.6 in May, compared to 56.5 a month earlier.
Analysts had expected a reading of 56.6.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, rose to 55.7 this month from 54.9 in April.
The consensus forecast was looking for a slight rise to 55.0.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The research group noted that private sector firms signaled a robust and accelerate rise in business activity “which adds to evidence of a sustained growth rebound in the second quarter of 2018.
However, IHS Markit also warned that input cost inflation rose to nearly a five-year high.
“The flash May PMI surveys point to an encouragingly solid pace of economic growth of 2.5-3% with monthly job gains running at just over 200,000, though the interesting action is coming on the prices front,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
“Input costs measured across both manufacturing and services are rising at the fastest rate for nearly five years, with the goods-producing sector seeing the steepest cost increases for seven years in recent months,” he explained.
Williamson pointed to the fact that supplier delivery delays - a key leading indicator of inflationary pressure - had risen to the highest point in the 11-year history of the survey. Increased demand was allowing suppliers to charge higher prices, while higher oil and energy prices were also pushing up firms’ costs. 
“Business optimism meanwhile remains at a three-year high, with companies commonly expecting rising demand to help drive business growth, setting the scene for further strong survey results in coming months,” Williamson concluded."

A Reuters poll of 10 analysts forecast manufacturing output in April will rise 8.3 percent from a year earlier.
""It's going to be because of the base effects in the pharmaceuticals cluster. We suspect it's going to look very similar to what happened with exports in April,"" said Brian Tan, economist, Nomura. 
A pick up in pharmaceuticals helped offset five consecutive months of decline of electronics exports, leading to an unexpectedly sharp rise in exports year-on-year.
Manufacturing and exports of electronics were one of Singapore's main drivers of growth last year, leading to an increase of 3.6 percent in GDP in 2017, and marking the fastest pace in three years.
Analysts and policymakers are concerned that the city-state's growth is heavily dependent on its electronics sector, and that the growth in pharmaceuticals industry is not necessarily a positive factor for the outlook due to its volatile nature. 
""One of the problems with pharmaceuticals is that it is very volatile, if you look at its growth patterns from last year, you can see it is going to reverse in June... the numbers may not look so good,"" Tan said. 
Manufacturing output in the city-state is also seen growing from the previous month in April, at 1.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the poll's median forecast.

In March, Singapore's industrial production grew better than expected at 5.9 percent year-on-year, and 0.3 percent from the month before on a seasonally adjusted basis.

49,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","French unemployment edges up, dampening Macron's hopes","By Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - French unemployment rose slightly in the first three months of the year, confounding economists' expectations for a decline and suggesting President Emmanuel Macron's policies to boost jobs and growth are struggling to find traction.
Data from the national statistics office INSEE showed the ILO jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent in the first quarter, up from 9.0 percent in the last quarter of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rate of 8.8 percent. 
While disappointing for a government that has banked on bringing high unemployment down via faster growth and tweaks to employment law, analysts suggest France may now be hampered by a wider loss of momentum across the euro zone.
""The first quarter data showed a slowdown in France but actually the country's loss of inertia wasn't a one-off, it was across Europe generally,"" said Lorne Baring, chief investment officer at B Capital SA.
""The question now is whether the second quarter brings France, and Europe as well, back towards the improving trend or if it confirms a slowdown is under way.""
At the end of last year, in the months after Macron's election victory, France looked to be in a strong position, with growth picking up and business and consumer confidence at or near highs.
But first quarter growth of 0.3 percent came in below expectations and manufacturing surveys and other indicators have since pointed to a slowdown in momentum.
""DISRUPTIVE FACTORS""
A survey of French purchasing managers on Wednesday showed business activity slowed more than expected in May, although the month was affected by a high number of holidays.
IHS Markit said its composite PMI, which covers the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 54.5 points from 56.9 in April, hitting its lowest level since January 2017.
""There have been short-term disruptive factors,"" said IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson, adding that companies remained upbeat about prospects for now. ""So we remain positive about the outlook.""
Part of the problem for the euro zone is a raft of political uncertainty, both at home and abroad.
While Germany continues to grow, weaker global trade and the looming prospect of a tariff battle with the United States have hit output. The rate of growth halved in the first quarter of the year.
Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, has still not appointed a prime minister since elections in March, and the candidate proposed by the populist coalition seeking to take office is an entirely unknown quantity. 
Yields on Italian debt have climbed -- reflecting the higher risk of holding Italian assets -- on the back of the political instability and the euroscepticism of both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League.

The rate of consumer-price growth fell to 2.4 percent from 2.5 percent in March, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had expected no change in the rate. Core inflation eased to 2.1 percent. The pound fell to the lowest level this year after the data.
The Bank of England expects inflation to retreat toward its 2 percent target over the next year as external influences abate, but officials are concerned a lack of spare capacity may be starting to fuel domestically generated price pressures.
After policy makers refrained from raising interest rates this month following a snow-blighted first quarter, money markets now put the chance of a hike in August at about 50-50.
Downward pressure on inflation came from air fares, which fell 0.2 percent over the month compared with an 18.6 percent surge a year earlier, when prices were boosted by the Easter vacation. The Easter holiday was in March this year.
Upward pressure came from auto fuel, with rising crude prices increasing the cost of filling up the tank by 1.2 percent.
The pound fell after the ONS report, dropping 0.6 percent to $1.3352. It earlier touched $1.3349, the lowest level since December.
Soft drink prices saw their biggest ever increase for the time of year -- up 2.8 percent from March -- following the introduction of a tax on sodas with a high sugar content. However, the impact on inflation was limited, and many retailers haven’t yet passed on the levy to consumers, the ONS said.
Higher oil costs pushed up producer input prices last month, but inflationary pressures have eased sharply over the past year as the effect of sterling’s 2016 depreciation dissipates.
House prices in March rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the same as in February. The worst-performing region was London, where values fell 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since September 2009 when Britain was in the grip of the financial crisis."

This was its lowest level since March 2017 and was below expectations for the reading to hold steady at the previous month’s 2.5% gain.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.4% in April.
That compared to an increase of 0.1% in the previous month.
Analysts had expected a gain of 0.5%.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.1% last month, below forecasts for an increase of 2.2%.
Core inflation advanced 2.3% in March.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 3.4% on an annualized basis in April, compared to previous month’s 3.3% rise.
The reading was in line with the consensus forecast.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.5% in April, in line with expectations.
RPI increased 0.1% in March.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 3.4% in April, matching the prior month’s reading.
Economists had expected a gain of just 3.3%.
Month-on-month, core RPI rose by 0.5% in April, compared to the 0.1% advance in the previous month.
The ONS indicated that the largest downward contribution to the change in the rate came from air fares, which it noted were influenced by the timing of Easter.
“Rising prices for motor fuels produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward effect,” the ONS said in the report.
For markets, the low level of inflation may ease pressure on the Bank of England to move forward with policy tightening. Traders are currently split over whether there will be a rate hike in August.
In testimony to the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, BoE governor Mark Carney reiterated that the central bank expects interest rates to rise at a limited and gradual rate."

A composite Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to an 18-month low of 54.1, from 55.1 in April, IHS Markit said on Wednesday. New order growth weakened, hiring and backlogs of work showed slower rates of increase and companies became less optimistic about the outlook.
“While prior months have seen various factors such as extreme weather, strikes, illness and the timing of Easter dampen growth, May saw reports of business being adversely affected by an unusually high number of public holidays,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Some of the fog will hopefully lift with the June PMI data, providing a clearer signal of the underlying growth momentum.” 
European Central Bank officials are carefully watching economic reports from across the 19-nation region as they prepare to set out the future path for monetary policy. Asset purchases are currently set to expire in September, although they could be extended if the growth and inflation outlook warrants further stimulus.
Preliminary PMI data for June will be published on June 22, a week after the Governing Council holds its next policy meeting. Officials have indicated in the past that they saw scope to wait until July to decide on their bond-buying program.
Williamson said that activity in euro-area manufacturing and services signals the economy is currently expanding at a quarterly pace of just over 0.4 percent. That would match first- quarter growth but remains below the rates seen in 2017.
“It’s also becoming increasingly evident that underlying growth momentum has slowed compared to late last year,” Williamson said. “More expensive oil and rising wages are meanwhile continuing to push companies’ costs higher, but weak final demand means firms are struggling to pass these higher costs onto customers.”"

China imported 640,000 tonnes of sorghum in April, up 87 percent on a year ago, ahead of a huge anti-dumping deposit announced by Beijing on April 17 after a two-month investigation. The country imports almost all of its sorghum from the United States.
News of the deposit, which still came earlier than the trade had expected, prompted several more cargoes of the grain already shipped from the United States to China to be resold to other countries before reaching Chinese ports.
April sorghum imports were up 12.3 percent from last month's 570,014 tonnes, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.
Beijing dropped the U.S. sorghum probe and anti-dumping deposit last week in a goodwill concession as the two sides held talks to resolve trade tensions. But the damage to shipments was already done and trade flows have been disrupted, traders said.
While the China customs data did not break down countries of origin, the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs between China and the United States was reflected in some other products.
Shipments of barley, used in feed and brewing, and an alternative to sorghum, rose 2.6 pct from last year's 1.1 million tonnes to 1.12 million tonnes, and were up 30.2 percent from 860,000 tonnes in March. 
Beijing in early April increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, although the impact on overall imports was not clear. 
China's pork imports fell 19 percent in April from March to 110,098 tonnes, but were still up 3.4 percent year on year. Imports were also pushed down by falling domestic pork prices, analysts said.
China bought 560,000 tonnes of fresh and dried fruits and nuts in April, up 31.6 percent from the previous year.
Imports of logs in April dropped 11.4 percent on year to 4.21 million cubic meters, as China ramped up inspections of imports of the wood from the United States. 
China bought 380,000 tonnes of corn in April, more than six times the 60,000 tonnes imported in March, having imported zero corn in April 2017.

Sugar imports rose 140.5 percent year on year to 470,000 tonnes in April, also up 23.7 percent from 380,000 tonnes in March, as some shipments delayed earlier at port arrived.

Household debt rose to a record 1,468 trillion won ($1.4 trillion) as of the end of March, up 8 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to a statement from the Bank of Korea. From the fourth quarter, the amount rose 1.2 percent.
President Moon Jae-in’s administration has taken a series of measures to tighten financial institutions’ lending terms and slow debt growth. While policy makers say the amount of debt isn’t an imminent threat to Korea’s financial system, they say lower-income borrowers may default as interest rates rise.
While the increase of 8 percent is still large, it’s below the 8.2 percent average rise seen from 2005 to 2014, before a series of interest-rate cuts led to sharper increases in household debt. The government’s goal is to keep annual growth below 8.2 percent.
The debt figures come a day before the central bank reviews its benchmark interest rate on Thursday. How board members assess the data -- whether they focus on the record-high amount or the slower growth -- would be of interest to investors and analysts. The debt was one reason analysts had forecast the BOK’s next policy change would be a rate increase.
Bank loans accounted for almost half of the increase in the debt from the previous quarter, while other financial institutions such as insurers and the Korea Housing Finance Corp. accounted for slightly less. Credit card purchases accounted for the rest."

LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Barclays  (L:BARC) banker charged with conspiring to manipulate Euribor benchmark interest rates told a London court on Tuesday that he could not remember receiving requests from traders for rates that would benefit their trading books.
But Colin Bermingham, a one-time senior rate submitter, told Southwark Crown Court that he would have accommodated Barclays traders if their requests were in line with the price for cash he saw in the market.
""I can't remember receiving any of those requests,"" the 61-year-old said when cross-examined by prosecutor Emma Deacon, for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). 
Bermingham is the second defendant to testify in the trial of bankers over alleged misconduct when setting the euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which determines the rates on trillions of financial contracts and loans worldwide.
Four ex-Barclays bankers and a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) employee are charged with conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Brussels-based Euribor rates between 2005 and 2009. 
Bermingham, Philippe Moryoussef, a former senior trader who is being tried in absentia, Italian-born Carlo Palombo, Sisse Bohart, a Dane, and Frankfurt-based Deutsche employee Achim Kraemer deny the charge.
Rates such as Euribor are submitted by major banks each day and were designed to reflect their estimated cost of borrowing in different currencies over various time frames. The prosecution alleges such rates should not be submitted with an eye on a bank's commercial interest.
Deacon said Bermingham had often responded over the bank's communication systems to trader requests for higher or lower rates with: ""sure"" and ""will do"".
But in May 2009, Barclays called a meeting at which staff from the money desk and compliance were told that rate submitters should not listen to trader requests when deciding what numbers to submit, the court was told.
""How did you think about what you had been doing when you found out...?"" Deacon asked. 

""I don't remember feeling one way or another about it,"" Bermingham said, adding staff had been told that accommodating trader requests was ""something we shouldn't be doing going forward"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Retail sales in Russia picked up in April, while real wages growth exceeded expectations as the unemployment rate fell, suggesting an economic recovery was under way, according to data released on Tuesday.
The monthly set of data released by the Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat, indicated that sanctions that the United States imposed on Moscow in early April had little immediate impact on Russia's fundamentals.
After two years of recession caused by a slump in oil prices and Western sanctions, the Russian economy is now recovering along with oil, the rouble has generally stabilized and global commodity prices remain favorable for an economy dependent on exports of energy and raw materials.
Retail sales, the key gauge for consumer demand, the primary driver of economic growth, were up 2.4 percent year-on-year in April after a 2.0 percent rise in the year to March.
Capital investment, the next most important driver, was up 3.6 percent year-on-year in the first quarter after increasing 1.4 percent in the same period a year earlier.
""The latest Russian activity figures suggest that GDP growth picked up to about 1.5 percent year-on-year at the start of the second quarter,"" the research firm Capital Economics said in a note.
""These data also provide early evidence that the tightening of U.S. sanctions and the fall in the ruble in early April have had little impact on the real economy so far.""
Kirill Tremasov, a former head of macroeconomic forecasting department at the Economy Ministry, said on his Telegram channel that Tuesday's set of data suggested annual GDP growth stood at 1.5 percent in April.
This year, the economy is projected to expand by 1.5-2.0 percent, according to the central bank's forecasts, after growing by 1.5 percent in 2017.
Real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, rose 7.8 percent year-on-year in April, beating analysts' call for a 5.9 percent increase.
At the same time, the unemployment rate inched lower to 4.9 percent in April, its lowest since August 2017, from 5.0 percent in March.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Betsabeth Casique saved for eight months for bus tickets out of Venezuela for herself and her three children. At 1.4 million bolivars each, they are worth what she earns in a month working as a nurse.
It is less than two dollars at the black market exchange rate.
When socialist President Nicolas Maduro won re-election to a six-year term on Sunday in a vote the opposition and foreign governments called illegitimate, Casique decided to leave, first for the western city of San Cristobal and from there to Cucuta, Colombia.
""That was the straw that broke the camel's back, what pushed me to do it faster,"" Casique, 29, said while charging her cell phone outside the Aeroexpresos Ejecutivos terminal in Caracas, where she was planning to buy tickets for a bus leaving on Tuesday.
Ninety-nine people bought tickets on Monday morning for that trip, said Greberli Rojas, a passenger who displayed a handwritten wait-list she was keeping to avoid disputes between passengers trying to fit on the bus.
Rojas, a 29-year-old accountant who arrived from the town of Barlovento in Miranda state and bought her ticket early Monday, planned to spend the night at the station to avoid losing her spot.
""I'm prepared to sell coffee because us migrants have to be prepared to start from the bottom,"" said Rojas, who plans to settle in Lima, Peru.
It appeared the emigration crisis Venezuela had experienced in recent years as its economy collapsed would continue since Maduro's government was unlikely to change policies that led to hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages and rising crime. 
The United Nations has estimated that nearly 1 million Venezuelans the country left between 2015 and 2017. 
Over the past weekend, migrants streamed across the border, skeptical that their votes would change anything in an election many thought would be rigged. Mainstream opposition called for a boycott and turnout was 46 percent compared with 80 percent in 2013's presidential election.
""We expected that the incumbents would win, so we decided to leave,"" said Jorge Hernandez, a 23-year-old engineering student who sold his Toyota Avalon to buy tickets for himself and his mother to leave Caracas from the Rutas de America terminal on Monday morning.
He brought bread and crackers for the 36-hour trip to Trujillo, Peru, where his sister has been waiting tables for two-and-a-half months.

This would mark the first quarterly loss for the home finance industry in four years, as 30-year mortgage rates hit a seven-year high last week, Fratantoni said.
Net production margin fell to 9.3 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 40.5 basis points in the prior quarter, according to the MBA.
The historic average on operating income is about 55 basis points, he said.
""We're assured it (the operating margin) will be in the negative mid-single digits"" in the first quarter, Fratantoni told reporters at the MBA National Secondary Market conference. ""Price competition has become extraordinarily tight.""
Slower business volume and rising costs would result in some industry consolidation in the form of exit among smaller lenders and scaling back by larger ones, he said.
The average interest rate on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of loan among U.S. homeowners, is expected to reach 5.0 percent by year-end, climbing to 5.4 percent in 2019 before stabilizing at that level in 2020.
Last week, mortgage rates rose in step with a bond market selloff that propelled 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) to the highest level since July 2011.
Worries about rising inflation and government borrowing lifted the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) to 3.128 percent on Friday, the highest level since July 2011, Reuters data showed.
Rising mortgage rates are expected to depress refinancing activity in the coming years. However, it is unlikely they will have much of a negative impact on lending to buy homes due to tight supply and solid demand, Fratantoni said.
In 2018, lenders are expected to make $1.167 trillion in loans for home purchases, up from $1.110 trillion in 2017. They will likely originate $446 billion in mortgages for refinancing, down from $600 billion in 2017, Fratantoni said.

64,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2018 02:27AM ET</span>","Japan's exports accelerate in April as volumes rise, outlook positive","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports accelerated in April on increased shipments of cars and machines used to make semiconductors, with rising volumes suggesting healthy overseas demand could help the economy recover quickly from a dip in the first quarter. 
Exports grew 7.8 percent in April from the same period a year ago, below the median estimate for an 8.1 percent annual increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. In March, exports grew an annual 2.1 percent.
In terms of volume, which strips away the impact of exchange rates, Japan's exports rose an annual 4.6 percent in April, faster than the 1.8 percent annual increase seen in March. 
Exports are likely to continue to grow thanks to increased demand for manufacturing equipment, cars and car parts, but Japan's trade surplus with the United States makes it a potential target for U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies.
""Overseas economies are in a growth phase, so Japan's exports will continue to do well,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The U.S. government may turn its attention to Japan's trade surplus, but there are steps Japan can take, especially given the close defense relationship between the two countries.""
The rise in the volume of exports was another reason to be optimistic, Miyazaki noted. 
Exports of cars rose 15.3 percent in April from the same period a year ago, while exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment rose 18.2 percent year-on-year, finance ministry data showed on Monday.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose an annual 10.9 percent in April, versus a 10.8 percent increase in the previous month, due to an increase of shipments of machines used to process metals and to make electronic components.
Japan's exports to China often serve as a barometer of global demand because companies in China use materials and equipment from Japan to make goods for export to other countries.
Japan's economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year, ending the best run of expansion in decades.
The April trade data suggests exports could help the economy quickly return to growth, but the rate of expansion could be slower than the previous growth spurt.
Japan's exports to the United States rose 4.3 percent year-on-year in April, faster than a 0.2 percent annual increase in March.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States was 615.7 billion yen ($5.55 billion) in April, up 4.7 percent from the same period a year ago. In March the trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 0.3 percent.
Since taking office last year, Trump has pushed to rewrite free-trade deals to protect U.S. companies and jobs from what is seen as unfair foreign competition. 
Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which affect Japanese companies, and has also criticized Japan for its low level of imports of American vehicles.
Last year Trump urged Japan to buy more U.S. military hardware, which remains an option for Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the United States. 
The United States and China have called off their threats of tariffs while they discuss ways China can buy more American goods to lower the U.S. trade deficit.

Some officials in Tokyo are worried that the United States could seek a similar measures from Japan.

66,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street's 'Sell in May' could be fading away,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - ""Sell in May and go away,"" arguably the most well-worn axiom on Wall Street, has proven to be shrewd advice during previous midterm election years. 
Though the exact origins of the phrase are a bit murky, up until recently, stocks had underperformed in the six-month period starting in May, which coincides with vacation for many traders between the Memorial Day and Labor Day holidays. 
But this year, investors may be better served by eschewing the adage as stocks look positioned to buck that trend, with corporate profits coming off a banner quarter and as the U.S. economy continues to gain traction. 
According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) has lost 64.71 points from May through October since 1950 versus a gain of 20,790.89 for the November through April months. Over the same time frame, the S&P (SPX) has gained 264.31 points during the May-October period, compared with a gain of 2,420.72 points during the other six months.
While stocks have risen in the November through April period, volatility has also increased. After hitting a record high on Jan. 26, the S&P dropped more than 10 percent to bottom out on Feb. 8 at 2,581 and tested the low again in late March. The index now sits about 5.5 percent below the January high. 
""I don’t think it is going to work this year,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. 
""The economy is strong, earnings are good, the market has already sold off a little bit.""
This year, May is off to a strong start, with both the Dow and S&P on track for their best performance in the month since 2009. 
Midterm years have proven to be particularly troublesome, however, according to data from LPL Research. 
Elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are set to take place in November. Historically, the party in power loses seats after a new president's election and the Republican party currently holds a majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
Since 1950, midterm years have only yielded an average gain of 0.1 percent on the S&P in the May through October period, with the index also suffering an average peak-to-trough pullback of 14.7 percent, the largest of the four years in the cycle. 
""Clearly midterm elections are a headwind and a concern but there are others as well,"" said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. 
""The difficulty of investing is on the rise, that is largely a factor of inflationary pressures becoming more prevalent and interest rates on the cusp of a regime change."" 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) touched a high of 3.128 percent on Friday, their highest level since July 2011 and many analysts expect them to climb towards 3.25 percent. 
As for selling in May, the last time the month was negative for both the Dow and the S&P was 2012. In the five years since, the S&P has climbed in the May through October period four times, with the only decline being a 0.3 percent dip in 2015. 
Another reason for optimism this year, according to LPL, has been the performance of the S&P 500 over the prior six months and its position relative to the index's 200-day moving average, a technical indicator. 
Since 1950, when the S&P has entered the ""sell in May"" period above its 200-day moving average after notching gains in the prior six months, the benchmark index has climbed about 3.3 percent, with gains 70.2 percent of the time. 
Perhaps even more telling for stocks is during midterm years; the S&P has climbed an average of 5.5 percent, with gains about two-thirds of the time when those conditions are met. 
For 2017-2018, the S&P rose 2.8 percent in the November though April period while closing out the period nearly 40 points above its 200-day moving average. 
""That is not even getting into the positive fundamental backdrop that is still in place with the corporate earnings strong, the overall fiscal policy which is still tax reform and potential infrastructure spending and deregulation,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""In these next six months we would be buyers of any weakness and wouldn’t be shocked at all if we bucked the 'sell in May and go away' trend for the sixth year out of the last seven.""

The consumer price index rose 2.2% last month, compared with the same month a year earlier.
Prices rose by 0.3% from a month earlier.
Economists had expected annual inflation to increase by 2.3% and monthly inflation to rise by 0.4%.
Core inflation, which excludes gasoline, was up 1.5% from a year earlier and rose by 0.1% from the previous month.
The Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at 2%, the midpoint of a target range of 1% to 3% over the medium term.

Markets saw only around 40% odds for a hike at the next policy decision on May 30."
68,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",Bank of Japan inflation target recedes as consumers resist price rises,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer price growth slowed in April for a second straight month, showing little of the inflationary momentum needed to reach the central bank's elusive 2 percent target.
The weakness in April inflation is particularly unwelcome for the Bank of Japan, which had hoped companies would rush to hike prices at the start of a new business year.
The slowdown, which came in the wake of first-quarter data showing the economy may have reached its peak, could discourage BOJ policymakers from signaling their intention to end its ultra-easy monetary policy, analysts say.
""The broad-based moderation in price pressures in April underlines that the Bank of Japan won't be able to tighten monetary policy anytime soon,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""We expect GDP growth to slow this year which suggests that capacity shortages won't intensify any further.""
The core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier, slightly less than a median market forecast for a 0.8 percent rise.
It followed a 0.9 percent gain in March, marking the second straight month of slowdown, despite recent gains in oil prices that pushed up electricity and gasoline bills.
The pace of increase in the core-core CPI, an index closely watched by the BOJ that strips away the impact of fresh food and energy costs, slowed to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent in March.
Processed food prices rose 1.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the same rate of increase as March, a sign few firms took the start of a new business year as an opportunity to pass rising costs on to consumers.
The ratio of goods that saw prices rise stood at 53.9 percent in April, roughly unchanged from March.
DEFLATIONARY MINDSET PERSISTS
The pressure to keep prices down is particularly strong for mass-market retailers with acutely cost-conscious customers. 
Fast food operator  Yoshinoya Holdings  Co (T:9861) has said it has no plans to raise the price of its famed beef bowl dish this year despite rising labor costs, having suffered a decline in sales after a price hike in 2014.
 Torikizoku Co Ltd  (T:3193) continues to see customer numbers fall since it raised the price of its grilled chicken skewers last October for the first time in nearly 30 years.
""The economy isn't necessarily doing that well,"" said Soichi Okazaki, president of retail giant Aeon (T:8267) Co Ltd.
While recent rises in oil costs may underpin price growth, analysts expect inflation to fall short of the BOJ's goal in coming years given slow wage growth and weak consumption.
""Companies remain cautious of raising prices,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Price rises for non-energy goods will likely remain slow, so we can't expect core CPI to accelerate much,"" he said, adding that core consumer inflation will likely hover below 1 percent for the time being.
Japan's economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year, suggesting growth has peaked after the best run of expansion in decades.
While analysts expect growth to rebound in the current quarter, any sign of the economy hitting a plateau could further push back market expectations of an exit from easy monetary policy.
The BOJ last month dropped a timeframe for hitting its price goal and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has conceded that pushing up inflation expectations would take time.

Almost half the economists polled by Reuters this month do not expect the BOJ to change its ultra-easy policy until 2020 or later, given sluggish inflation.

The latest fall in the BOJ’s key inflation gauge will likely heighten questions about the sustainability of its stimulus program, which is widely thought to be both at the limits of its powers and producing diminishing returns. Still, private economists are pushing back their forecasts for when the BOJ will begin tightening policy. Key factors going forward will be oil prices and the yen’s exchange rate.

70,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Rising stars slash debt costs in robust U.S. economy,"By Jonathan Schwarzberg
NEW YORK (LPC) - Oil producer Continental Resources is one of several US companies that have been able to cut borrowing costs after their credit ratings were upgraded to investment-grade on the back of rising commodity prices and a robust economy. 
The number of companies poised to cross the threshold to high-grade from speculative-grade or ""junk"" ratings rose to 18 in the first quarter from 15 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The number of potential ""fallen angels"" that could move in the other direction dropped to 35 from 40 in the first quarter, which is the 10th consecutive quarter to see a reduction, according to Moody’s Investors Service. 
The proportion of potential fallen angels to ""rising stars"" also dropped to 1.9 times on March 31 from 2.7 times on December 31, according to Moody’s. It was as high as 5.7 times in the fourth quarter of 2015 after oil prices collapsed, which was the highest level since 8.0 times in June 2009, after the financial crisis. 
“Economic strength, along with improved commodity prices, is a factor in the ratio of fallen angels to rising stars remaining below historical averages,” said Michael Corelli, a senior credit officer at Moody’s. 
Companies typically need at least two investment-grade ratings to move into high-grade territory with ratings of BBB-/Baa3 or higher, from high-yield, which starts at BB+/Ba1.  
Fitch gave Continental Resources its second ratings upgrade on April 30, which allowed it to reach investment-grade status after S&P upgraded the company to BBB- from BB+ in February. Moody’s rated it Ba2, two notches below investment-grade, in March. 
Moving up to investment-grade can reduce borrowing costs significantly if interest margins are linked to ratings grids. High-grade ratings also help companies to refinance more cheaply. 
Continental Resources was upgraded shortly after the company lined up a US$1.5bn revolving credit facility with pricing linked to a ratings grid, which saw pricing fall to 150bp from 175bp over Libor. 
The company has traditionally used its revolving credit, and had US$188m of outstanding borrowings under its revolver at the end of 2017 which it repaid in the first quarter of 2018, according to filings with the Securities Exchange Commission.  
Continental Resources will also save money on the commitment fee, which dropped to 20bp from 25bp, if the revolving credit facility is undrawn. 
PRO RATA SAVINGS 
An investment-grade credit rating for loan issuers means that companies can easily switch from syndicated term loans to less expensive pro-rata facilities, which can save up to 300bp. Discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) did just that in April, after Moody’s upgraded its debt to Baa3 in March from Ba2.  
Dollar Tree lined up a US$1.25bn revolving credit facility and a US$782m term loan shortly after the upgrade to replace 5.75% senior notes due in 2023 and existing term loans, including a US$650m term loan B-2 due in July 2022.
Dollar Tree’s new term loan, which matures in April 2020, is priced at 100bp over Libor, compared to a fixed interest rate of 425bp on its existing term loan B. 
Other rising stars this year have included building products manufacturer  Masco Corp  (NYSE:MAS) in March and chipmaker  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) in January, which were both upgraded to investment-grade at Baa3 from Ba1, according to Moody’s.
The pattern of rising stars and upgrades could be threatened by increased M&A activity in the robust US economy as companies making acquisitions load up with debt to buy rivals, which can drag their credit rating lower, according to Corelli.
Changes in technology could also hit high-grade credit ratings and produce more fallen angels in the near future, according to Michael Terwilliger, a portfolio manager at investment firm Resource America. 
“Unquestionably the biggest threat facing all businesses—whether they are high-yield issuers or not—is technology,” Terwilliger said. “The Uber/Facebook/Amazons of the world are quickening the pace of change in our economy, threatening the core of countless businesses. Given the pace of technological change, the trend will inevitably result in more fallen angels versus rising stars over time.”

Higher borrowing costs have not yet caused a meaningful squeeze on the housing market, as underlying demand remains solid, Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said.
“While this year’s higher mortgage rates have not caused much of a ripple in the strong demand levels for buying a home seen in most markets, inflationary pressures and the prospect of rates approaching 5 percent could begin to hit the psyche of some prospective buyers,” he said in statement. 
Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged 4.61 percent in the week ended May 17, matching the level last seen in May 2011. A week earlier, 30-year rates averaged 4.55 percent, the U.S. mortgage finance agency said.
Average 15-year mortgage rates rose to 4.08 percent in the latest week from 4.01 percent, while interest rates on five-year adjustable mortgages averaged 3.82 percent, up from 3.77 percent a week earlier, Freddie Mac said.
Worries about rising inflation and government borrowing lifted the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) to 3.122 percent earlier Thursday, the highest since July 2011, Reuters data showed.

The consensus forecast had been for a reading of 21.0.
Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
With regard to future activity in the sector, new orders surged to 40.6 in May, compared to last month's reading of 18.4.
The employment index advanced to 30.2 in May, compared to a prior reading of 27.1, indicating a faster pace of hiring.

""Nearly 64 percent of the firms expect price increases for purchased inputs over the next six months, and 36 percent expect higher prices for their own manufactured goods,"" the report said.
""The indexes for prices paid and received continued to suggest price pressures. Looking ahead six months, the firms continued to be optimistic about the outlook for manufacturing activity,"" the survey added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits increased more than expected last week, but the number of Americans on unemployment rolls fell to its lowest level since 1973, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.
Other data on Thursday showed an acceleration in mid-Atlantic factory activity this month, with manufacturers saying they were boosting employment and asking for higher prices for their products. The combination of a tightening labor market and firming inflation bolsters expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
""The U.S. labor market is headed toward becoming the tightest in recent memory,"" said Kathryn Asher, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended May 12, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week. 
The labor market is viewed as being close to or at full employment, with the jobless rate near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent and within striking distance of the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. The U.S. central bank raised rates in March and forecast at least two more hikes for this year.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 87,000 to 1.71 million in the week ended May 5, the lowest level since December 1973. Declining continuing claims underscore tightening labor market conditions and support economists' expectations that wage growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. 
The labor market and regional factory data added to strong reports this week on consumer spending and industrial production in suggesting that economic growth was picking up early in the second quarter after slowing at the start of the year. 
Growth estimates for the second quarter are around a 3.0 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate in the January-March period.
A report from the Conference Board on Thursday showed its leading economic index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent in April after a similar gain in March. That indicates strong growth should continue into the second half of the year.
The yield on the 30-year U.S. government bond rose to its highest level since July 2015, helping to lift the dollar against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher.
SOLID JOB GROWTH
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 213,250 last week, the lowest level since December 1969. 
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls portion of May's employment report.
The four-week average of claims fell 18,250 between the April and May survey periods, suggesting solid job growth. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in April after rising by 135,000 in March. Job gains are slowing as employers struggle to find skilled workers.
There were a record 6.6 million unfilled jobs in March, according to government data published last week.
Expectations of strong job growth this month were also bolstered by a separate report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed which showed its manufacturing business outlook survey's current general activity index rose about 11 points to a reading of 34.4 in May. 
Manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region reported hiring more workers this month and increasing hours for their existing workforce. The survey's employment index rose to a seven-month high. While a measure of prices paid for raw materials by factories in the region fell, it remained at high levels.
The survey's prices received index rose to its highest reading since February 1989. Nearly 64 percent of the firms expected input price increases over the next six months, and 36 percent anticipated higher prices for their goods. 
In response to a special question on prices and wages, manufacturers in the region said they expected changes in prices of their goods to exceed inflation over the next year. They also expected wages and benefits for factory workers to increase 3 percent over the same period. 
Though these findings are unchanged from when the same question was asked in February, they fit in with economists' predictions that inflation will overshot the Fed's 2 percent target. The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price excluding food and energy, increased 1.9 percent year-on-year in March.

""While the strong growth should continue through the rest of the year, the rising pricing power it is supporting is becoming worrisome,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank on Thursday hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time since November 2014, as expected, in a bid to bolster the fragile rupiah.
Bank Indonesia (BI) raised the 7-day reverse repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent. In 2016 and 2017 combined, BI cut the key by 200 bps to try to spur lending and faster economic growth.
In a Reuters poll, 13 of 21 economists had predicted a rate at Thursday's meeting, the last for Governor Agus Martowardojo.
The governor, who will be succeeded by Perry Warjiyo later this month, said the hike was in response to rising global financial uncertainty amid tighter U.S. dollar liquidity.
""BI will continue to monitor economic developments and is ready to take firmer actions to ensure macroeconomic stability,"" Martowardojo said.
In the month since BI last met on April 19 and said it would be an ""overkill or counterproductive"" to be raising rates, consensus expectations swiftly turned to seet a rate rise as needed to put a floor under the falling rupiah. 
Southeast Asia's largest economy is one of the region's worst affected by the combination of rising U.S. yields and higher oil prices, and has seen about $4 billion leave its markets over the past month as foreign investors review their exposure to higher-yielding emerging markets. 
The rupiah  has fallen more than 5 percent to past 14,000 per dollar in four months as Indonesian 10-year bond yields jumped more than a percentage point over that period, and the stock market (JKSE) is down 8 percent this year.

On Thursday, BI maintained its 2018 economic growth outlook at 5.1-5.5 percent and said that annual inflation would remain within its target range of 2.5-4.5 percent.

76,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","Japan core machinery orders fall in March, capex recovery seen intact","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell in March for the first time in three months, but manufacturers forecast a rise for April-June, suggesting capital expenditure could hold up despite news that the economy contracted in the first quarter. 
The 3.9 percent fall in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, compared with a 3.0 percent drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders will rise 7.1 percent in April-June, after rising 3.3 percent in the previous three months and up for a third straight quarter.
""The upshot is that non-residential investment should remain a key growth driver this year,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
The machinery orders data follows a gross domestic product (GDP) report out on Wednesday showing that the world's third-largest economy contracted an annualized 0.6 percent in January-March, ending an uninterrupted eight-quarter expansion and suggesting growth may have peaked.
The GDP data also showed capital expenditure declined 0.1 percent in January-March, falling for the first time in six quarters.
While many economists see the economy returning to growth this quarter led by exports, capital expenditure is also expected to be underpinned by factory automation and demand for labor-saving technologies to cope with labor shortages.
""Autonomous recovery in capital expenditure is in place as the Bank of Japan's latest tankan survey suggested. I don't think an uptrend in business investment backed by exports and domestic labor shortages has changed at all,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Still, potential fallout from Sino-U.S. trade frictions and protectionist U.S. policies cloud the outlook for Japan's capital expenditure and export-reliant economy, especially if Japanese products become target of U.S. criticism, Minami said. 
The two economic powerhouses - and Japan's major trading partners - have threatened each other with heavy tariffs amid U.S. disapproval of China's trade practices and its treatment of U.S. intellectual property.
The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment that machinery orders are picking up.
By sector, orders from manufacturers declined 17.5 percent in March, down for the first time in three months, the data showed.
Service-sector orders increased 2.2 percent, up for a third straight month.
Overseas sales of machinery, which are not counted as core orders, fell 7.2 percent in March, down for two months in a row.

Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, declined 2.4 percent in March, the data showed.

Manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in a report on output across the industrial sector, which comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent rise in manufacturing. But the Fed's new estimates of factory output in prior months showed output was slightly lower than previously believed in each month between November and March.
Overall industrial output expanded 0.7 percent in April and estimates of output in three of the previous four months were also lowered, including a sharply reduced estimate for February.
A 2.3 percent increase in machinery production bolstered the overall gain in factory output, although a drop in production of primary metals and fabricated metal products weighed on the sector.
The report follows a survey of factory managers published earlier this month that showed a slowdown in U.S. factory activity, with manufacturers complaining about rising commodity prices in the wake of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
A recent Fed report based on comments of the central bank's business contacts across the country showed rising concern about the tariffs, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month it was too early to know how they would affect the U.S. economic outlook.
The utilities index jumped 1.9 percent last month. 
In the 12 months through April overall industrial output rose 3.5 percent.
The percentage of industrial capacity in use rose 0.4 percentage point in April to 78.0 percent.
Fed officials look to capacity use as a signal for how much further the economy can accelerate before sparking higher inflation.

The Federal Reserve reported that industrial output advanced 0.7% last month after gaining 0.5% in March.
Economists had forecast industrial production rising 0.5%.
Meanwhile, manufacturing production increased 0.5% in April, compared to the 0.1% increase in the previous month.

79,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",Industrial production rises strongly; homebuilding tumbles,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production increased solidly in April amid an acceleration in manufacturing and mining output, the latest indication that the economy was gathering momentum early in the second quarter.
The upbeat report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a pickup in consumer spending in April. But a sharp drop in homebuilding and permits last month put a wrinkle on the brightening economic picture.
Industrial production expanded 0.7 percent in April, matching March's increase, the Fed said. Manufacturing output, which accounts for more than 70 percent of industrial production, rose 0.5 percent as a 2.3 percent increase in machinery production offset a drop in production of primary metals and fabricated metal products.
The industrial sector is being supported by strengthening domestic and global economy, a still-weak U.S. dollar and tax cuts. But there are concerns that trade tensions between the United States and China could slow momentum. 
""Risks continue to hover over our industrial outlook, mainly related to trade policy,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""China-U.S. trade tensions are slowly rising while strains between the U.S. and Europe are becoming more visible following the Trump administration's decision to back out of the Iran nuclear deal.""
A survey early this month showed trade policy as the top concern for manufacturers, with varies industries complaining that the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports had pushed up commodity prices. 
Some manufacturers reported that ""business planning is at a standstill"" as a result of the tariffs.
Last month, mining production increased 1.1 percent, boosted by a 3.0 percent rise in oil and gas well drilling. Utilities production advanced 1.9 percent. 
Industrial capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.4 percentage point to 78.0 percent, its highest reading since March 2015. It remains 1.8 percentage points below its long-run average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilization measures as a signal of how much slack remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
HOUSING TREADING WATER
Strong industrial output and a pickup in consumer spending support expectations of second-quarter growth around a 3 percent annualized rate. That should allow the Fed to raise interest rates next month. 
The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in March and forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. The economy grew at a 2.3 percent pace in the first quarter. 
The dollar rallied to a five-month high against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading marginally higher.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.287 million units in April. The decline reversed March's rise, indicating that housing continued to tread water.
Building permits fell 1.8 percent to a rate of 1.352 million units last month. Starts fell in the Northeast, West and Midwest, but rose in the South.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, edged up 0.1 percent to a rate of 894,000 units last month. Single-family homebuilding has lost momentum since setting a 948,000-unit pace last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
Last month's gain in single-family starts was outpaced by an 11.3 percent decline in groundbreaking activity on multi-family housing units. Residential construction has been hamstrung by rising prices for building materials and shortages of land and skilled workers.
While a survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders perked up in May, builders complained that ""the record-high cost of lumber is hurting builders' bottom lines and making it more difficult to produce competitively priced houses for newcomers to the market.""  
The Trump administration in April last year imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. These constraints have left builders unable to plug an acute shortage of houses on the market, restraining home sales growth.
""The industry is still under capacity constraints and suffers from not being able to hire as many workers as it would like,"" said Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 

""In the next two years, residential construction will also pull back slightly once the Fed finishes increasing short-term rates ... reducing the amount of credit going to real estate development.""

Eurostat confirmed its preliminary flash estimate that its consumer price index slowed to 1.2% year-on-year in April, down from 1.3% in March.
Core, or underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, fell to an annual rate of 0.7%, also in line with the preliminary estimate, but down from 1.0% in the previous month.

Speaking after the bank’s latest policy meeting in April, ECB President Mario Draghi acknowledged that the pace of the euro area recovery had moderated since the start of the year, but signaled no change in monetary policy.
Draghi said his overall assessment was one of “caution tempered by an unchanged confidence” that inflation is moving towards the ECB’s target of just below 2%.

82,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2018 03:07AM ET</span>","Japan's GDP ends best growth run in decades as spending, trade fade","By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy contracted more than expected at the start of this year, suggesting growth has peaked after the best run of expansion in decades, unwelcome news for a government struggling to get traction for its reflationary policies.
The world's third largest economy shrank by 0.6 percent on an annualized basis, a much more severe contraction than the median estimate for an annualized 0.2 percent decline.
The contraction, which was driven by declines in investment and consumption and weaker export growth, comes as Japan Inc frets over the possible effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies on exports.
It also highlights the central bank's vulnerability to an economic or financial shock after five years of heavy monetary stimulus has left it with little ammunition to defend growth.
Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said there was no change to the government's view that the economy was recovering moderately, predicting a resumption in growth to be driven mainly by private consumption and capital expenditure.
""But we need to be mindful of the impact of overseas economic uncertainty and market volatility,"" he added. 
External demand - or exports minus imports - added just 0.1 percentage point to first-quarter GDP as imports slowed more than exports.
However, a breakdown of the data shows export growth is losing momentum, expanding just 0.6 percent in the first quarter after growth of 2.2 percent October-December last year. 
Slower export growth reflected a decline in shipments of mobile phone parts and factory equipment in the quarter, a government official said. 
This is a concern for Japanese manufacturers because many of these machines and electronic components are sent to China, where they are used to produce goods for export, but this trade is at risk if the Trump administration's threatened tariffs on Chinese exports go ahead. 
""Globally, IT-related items have been in an adjustment phase, which weighed down Japan's exports and factory output,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Economists say Japan's first-quarter contraction is temporary, but the rebound will not be nearly as strong as previous quarters.
""The economy is not headed for a recession,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. ""However, it is clear that in the long term the pace of growth is slowing.""
Wednesday's data marked the end to eight straight quarters of economic expansion, which was the longest stretch of growth since a 12-quarter run between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989. 
Fourth quarter growth was revised to an annualized 0.6 percent, down from the 1.6 percent estimated earlier.
Capital expenditure fell 0.1 percent, down for the first time in six quarters, suggesting corporate investment is not as strong as many economists had expected. The median estimate was for a 0.4 percent increase.
The capital spending figures may presage data due on Thursday that is forecast to show core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell in March for the first time in three months.
Consumer spending fell marginally, registering a decline of less than one percentage point in the first quarter. The median estimate was for consumer spending to remain unchanged.
""The economy is unlikely to continue to contract further. The global economy is performing well and the yen is trading beyond 110 yen against the dollar, so once exports start to grow again, the economy will return to a moderate growth path,"" said 
Maruyama of SMBC Nikko Securities.
The first-quarter contraction could make Japanese politicians more reluctant to implement a hike in sales tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent scheduled for next year.
A sales tax hike to 5 percent from 3 percent in 2014 caused a large fall in consumer spending and tipped the economy into recession.
""The revised GDP data 2017 showed the economy had already started to slow down from the beginning of last year. And the economic contraction for January-March may support some ruling officials' call for a delay in a planned sales tax hike,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Securities.

Yet economists expect a rebound in the current quarter as the global economy regains traction.
Key Takeaways
Japan’s economy had expanded at well above its potential growth rate for a year, as strong export growth fueled production and investment, helping to raise wages and inflationary pressures. The first-quarter slowdown likely sapped progress on inflation -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicted core inflation fell in April to 0.7 percent. Yet most economists see GDP rebounding in the current quarter, fueled partly by better export growth and production.

86,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Japan's first quarter GDP growth seen slowing sharply in setback for 'Abenomics',"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely slowed to a crawl, or possibly even contracted slightly at the start of this year, which would break the longest run of growth seen for decades and thwart Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary 'Abenomics' polices. 
Many economists expect the world's third largest economy will return to growth in the current quarter, while blaming temporary factors such as bad weather and a slowdown in global electronic products demand for the first-quarter slump.
But potential fallout from Sino-U.S. trade frictions and global protectionism cloud the outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy in the coming quarters, they say.
""The economy maintains momentum towards recovery but exports are slowing as global growth seems to have peaked in the fourth quarter,"" said Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""Manufacturers are piling up inventories of goods and the United States is leaning towards protectionism, so Japan's economy may struggle to accelerate in the second quarter onwards.""
Policymakers worry that next year's planned sales tax hike could hurt fragile domestic demand as sluggish wages keep a lid on consumer spending, despite the record profits earned by Japanese corporations.
A sharp slowdown could also add to the headaches of a premier grappling with domestic issues such as suspected favoritism, declining support, and opposition pressure for his finance minister to resign. 
A slowdown could also call the Bank of Japan's rosy economic outlook into question, especially after the central bank last month ditched a firm timeframe for meeting its elusive 2 percent inflation goal after more than five years of monetary stimulus. 
All this could mean that the government will keep the fiscal spigot wide open and maintain pressure on the central bank to prolong its massive monetary stimulus, some economists say. 
Cabinet Office data due on Wednesday is expected to show Japan's economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent in January-March from the previous quarter, slowing sharply from 1.6 percent annual growth seen in October-December 2017.
A contraction would mark the first decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in nine quarters, ending the longest run of growth since a 12-quarter streak from April-June 1986 to January-March 1989 during Japan's economic bubble.
A 0.2 percent contraction would translate into a flat quarter-on-quarter reading, a Reuters poll of 18 economists found. 
Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy, probably stood flat after a 0.5 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
The quarter was hit by bad weather that drove up fresh vegetable prices and dampened consumer spending.
External demand - or exports minus imports - likely made no contribution to first-quarter GDP as exports slowed from the rapid growth seen in the second half of 2017, led by strong exports of electronics and electrical sectors products related to smartphones.

Capital expenditure likely rose 0.4 percent, versus a 1 percent gain in the previous quarter, led by demand for factory automation and labor-saving technologies as companies tried to cope with a labor shortage.

87,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Gain Points to Healthier Second Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose in broad fashion last month as bigger after-tax paychecks helped compensate for rising fuel costs, signaling consumer demand was off to a firm start this quarter.
The value of sales increased 0.3 percent in April, matching the median forecast, after a 0.8 percent advance in the prior month that was stronger than initially reported, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday.
So-called retail-control group sales, which are used to calculate gross domestic product and exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations, improved 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent gain.
The results add to the expectation that consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, will rebound from its first-quarter weak patch. A strong job market and higher take-home pay in wake of tax reductions are buoying Americans’ wherewithal to spend and cushioning the squeeze from costlier fuel that leaves people with less money to buy other goods and services.
“Households are in good spirits and are spending in the new season,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note. “Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people’s pockets.”
The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.05 percent after the report and a separate figure showing manufacturing in New York state expanded at a faster pace this month.
Retail sales data for February were also revised up to unchanged from a previously estimated 0.1 percent decrease.
Nine of 13 major retail categories showed advances in April, led by the biggest jump in sales at apparel stores since March of last year. Increased receipts were also evident at furniture merchants, building-materials outlets, Internet retailers and department stores.
Filling-station receipts increased 0.8 percent, the most since January and reflecting a jump in gasoline costs that are now near the highest level since late 2014. That probably boosted retail sales as Commerce Department figures aren’t adjusted for price changes.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales also rose 0.3 percent, after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in the previous month.
The Commerce Department’s retail report may help economists tweak their forecasts for how consumer spending began the second quarter after growing 1.1 percent in the first three months of 2018, a slowdown following three quarters of robust gains.
While consumer spending has remained solid in this expansion, business investment has also been posting strong growth in recent quarters. Tax cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law at the end of 2017 were seen as providing a further jolt to consumption and capital spending that would spur growth toward the president’s 3 percent goal.
Economists including those at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). have noted the recent runup in gasoline prices, and said persistenly higher fuel costs this year would risk eroding a sizeable portion of the tax benefits.
Demand for automobiles barely rose. Purchases at automobile dealers climbed 0.1 percent after increasing 2.1 percent in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased marginally in April as rising gasoline prices cut into discretionary spending, but consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter.
The economic outlook got a boost from other data on Tuesday showing factory activity regaining momentum in May on strong orders growth. While manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, they were absorbing much of the higher costs, a sign inflation will probably continue to increase at a moderate pace.
""A better pace of real consumer spending growth is taking hold in the second quarter,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. ""However, rising fuel costs may be sapping gains in other spending categories.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month after surging 0.8 percent in March. April's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Retail sales in April advanced 4.7 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Economists estimated that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was growing at a 2.5 percent annualized rate early in the second quarter. Consumer spending grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the January-March quarter, which was the slowest in nearly five years.
The economy expanded at a 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter. Growth is expected to accelerate to a 3.0 percent pace in the April-June period.
In a separate report, the New York Federal Reserve said its Empire State current business conditions index rebounded four points to a reading of 20.1 in May. The rise recouped the bulk of March's decline in the index. The survey's prices paid index raced to its highest level since 2011. But a measure of prices received by manufacturers rose marginally.
Stronger consumer spending together with steadily rising inflation support economists' expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year.
The U.S. dollar rallied to a five-month high against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to a seven-year high. Stocks on Wall Street were weaker. 
GASOLINE PRICES A BURDEN
Economists blamed the slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter on delays in processing tax refunds. They also said clean-up efforts in the wake of back-to-back hurricanes in late 2017 had pulled forward spending into the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending is being supported by rising wages, which are being driven by a robust labor market. While lower income taxes could also provide a boost, rising gasoline prices could blunt some of the stimulus. Prices at the pump have increased about 31 cents to near $3.00 per gallon since January, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
""Looking ahead, the consumer now faces the added burden of higher gasoline prices,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
With crude oil prices rising after President Donald Trump's decision last week to pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and vow to put tough sanctions on Tehran, gasoline prices are likely to remain elevated.
In April, auto sales edged up 0.1 percent after accelerating 2.1 percent in March. Receipts at service stations jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting higher gasoline prices, following a 0.3 percent gain in March.
Sales at restaurants and bars fell 0.3 percent, the largest drop since February 2017. Americans also cut back on spending on hobbies. Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores dipped 0.1 percent last month, matching March's drop. 
Consumers also scaled back spending on personal grooming, with sales at health and personal care stores falling 0.4 percent last month. But households increased spending at furniture, building material and clothing stores last month.

They also boosted online purchases, but sales at electronics and appliance stores fell.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German growth halved in the first quarter of the year due to weaker trade and less state spending, data showed on Tuesday, though analysts said they saw it as a temporary blip.
Europe's biggest economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first three months, the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016, preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
This compared with 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters forecast of analysts and followed an expansion rate of 0.6 percent in the final three months of last year.
Still, it marked the 15th consecutive quarter of expansion, the longest period of uninterrupted growth since German reunification.
""Is it a pause or a fundamental shift? For us the answer is clear: It's just a blip,"" DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said. He pointed to continued strong foreign demand and vibrant domestic activity due to record employment and rising wages.
""However, this should not hide the fact that risks to the economic outlook have risen not least due to the neo-protectionist aspirations and sanctions policy of the U.S. government,"" Scheuerle added.
The statistics office said positive contributions in the first quarter came mainly from domestic demand while trade was weak.
""Investment rose sharply, with significantly more investment in construction, but also in equipment,"" the office said. Household spending rose slightly while state consumption fell.
On the year, the German economy grew by a calendar-adjusted 2.3 percent in the first quarter, the data showed. This was just short of the consensus forecast of 2.4 percent.
The office also confirmed full-year GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2017 which translated into a calendar-adjusted rate of 2.5 percent. This was the strongest pace since 2011.
The DIHK Chambers of Commerce and Industry also blamed the slowdown in the first quarter on a flu epidemic, an unusually high number of strikes and an above-average number of holidays.
""The start of the year is a disappointment, but not yet the beginning of the end of the upswing,"" DIHK managing director Martin Wansleben said.
The government has also said it expects the economy to bounce back in the second quarter due to full order books and high employment. Berlin forecasts 2.3 percent growth this year.
""The upswing has cooled down a bit, but it's still intact,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said. ""We expect stronger growth rates in the months ahead.""
Jennifer McKeown from Capital Economics said the economy will get a boost from increased public spending on child benefits and pensions in the coming quarters while growth among major export partners would also pick up again.
""In all, we still see German GDP rising by 2.5 percent this year as a whole and the renewed strength of the euro zone's largest economy will encourage the ECB to signal this summer that asset purchases will not last into 2019,"" she added.

The release of the preliminary data does not include a detailed breakdown but only a qualitative assessment. The office will release more detailed GDP results on 24 May.

Developers sold 729 units last month, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said Tuesday. That’s more than the 716 units in March and the highest since November. Still, sales are running at a slower pace than early last year.
The city-state’s housing market is showing signs of recovering from a four-year slump even as officials watch cautiously after previous bouts of overheating. Property prices climbed 3.9 percent in the first quarter, the biggest gain in almost eight years.
“The sales momentum continues to catch on as there is ample supply to fuel it,” said Desmond Sim, head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE). “I expect the same for the coming months so that full-year numbers will exceed those of 2017.”

95,By Investing.com,"<span>May 15, 2018 01:06AM ET</span>","Weaker-than-expected China April Investment, Retail Sales Cloud Economic Outlook ","Investing.com – Fixed asset investment in China rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 from a year earlier, compared to the general consensus of a 7.4% gain, official data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the country’s economy might be losing steam.
Meanwhile, retails sales grew 9.4% from a year earlier, compared to the estimates of 10.0%. Property sales growth also softened to 1.3% in January-April, down from 3.6% in January-March, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
On the other hand, industrial production output gained 7.0% in April, the NBS said, outperforming the general consensus of 6.4%.
The statistics bureau noted that the industrial output data showed the China-U.S. trade frictions have yet to show any significant impact on China’s economy.
The two nations are set to resume trade talks this week, as China’s top economic official Liu He arrives in Washington on Tuesday for trade discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that would run until Saturday. Reports suggested that Liu might be ready to offer U.S. companies easier access to Chinese markets.
The news came after the U.S.’s request of a more precise timetable on when and how China would open up its markets, as U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said on Tuesday that the two countries are still ""very far apart"" on resolving trade frictions."
96,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",China Data Shows a Hint of Slowdown While Factories Still Hum,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic momentum broadly held up in April with industrial production exceeding forecasts, though slowing investment signaled a moderation in the coming months.
Industrial output rose 7 percent in April from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said Tuesday, versus a projected 6.4 percent in a Bloomberg survey and 6 percent in March. Retail sales expanded 9.4 percent from a year earlier, versus a forecast 10 percent, Fixed-asset investment rose 7 percent year-on-year in the first four months, compared with an estimated 7.4 percent.
The reports are among the first official readings unaffected by the Lunar New Year holiday, which skewed year-on-year comparisons for the first three months. The mixed data confirm a picture of an economy already in a gradual cyclical slowdown, at a time when it is facing risks ranging from trade tensions with the U.S. to an ongoing campaign to curb excessive debt.
“Regulatory tightening in China’s financial system is starting to drag on growth,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong. “Fixed-asset investment, especially infrastructure, may slow further in the coming months as tighter financial regulations, especially regarding shadow banking, are starting to bite.”
A key indicator of performance for the rest of the year lies in the real estate sector. Property development investment in the first four months expanded 10.3 percent from the same period a year earlier.
""Infrastructure investment has been slowing for a while but property investment is still holding up and we’re not expecting that to slow until going into the second half of this year,"" Donna Kwok, a senior China economist at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""Moderation is underway but it’s taking its time.""
Total Demand
The slowdown in infrastructure investment is partly due to government efforts to slow wasteful public-private joint investment and curb local government debt, said National Statistics Bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua at a briefing in Beijing.
“Total demand is showing signs of weakening, which is closely related to the ongoing deleveraging and also the tightening of PPP projects,” said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst at Bank of Communications Co. in Shanghai. “The external shocks aren’t as big as expected, and the economy in general is still stabilizing despite the slight slowdown.”
Though rhetoric around the trade dispute with the U.S. remains heightened, it hasn’t yet hit the economy, said the statistics bureau’s Liu. Vice Premier Liu He, who is President Xi Jinping’s top aide for economic matters, will travel Tuesday to the U.S. for trade talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday in Beijing, a potential avenue for further easing of tensions.
There are clouds on the horizon for exports, said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia-Pacific economist at IHS Markit in Singapore. The Caixin Media Co. and Markit Economics Ltd. manufacturing gauge’s reading for booked shipments dropped to the weakest level since June 2016 last month and the sub-indexes of an official manufacturing gauge tracking new export orders both declined.

97,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 02:17AM ET</span>","China property investment growth slows, sales dip on increased curbs","By Kevin Yao and Yawen Chen
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's property investment growth slowed in April while sales marked their biggest fall in six months as higher borrowing costs and increased curbs on buyers weighed on demand, backing views that a key driver of the economy is losing some momentum.
Real estate investment rose 10.2 percent in April from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 10.8 percent rise in March, according to Reuters calculation based on National Bureau of Statistics data. The figure mainly focuses on residential real estate but also includes commercial and office space.
Property directly affects 40 other business sectors in China and is a major driver for the economy but a furious market boom since 2016 has raised concerns and prompted a flurry of government measures to tame soaring home prices.
""Real estate developers are launching fewer new projects in the face of weak sales growth, which has taken a hit recently due to slower mortgage lending and tighter property controls,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note after the data.
Property sales by floor area fell 4.1 percent in April on-year, the weakest monthly performance since October 2017 and a turnaround from a 3.2 percent gain in March.
In the first four months of the year, investment grew 10.3 percent from a year earlier, slowing slightly from the first quarter when growth hit 10.4 percent, its fastest in three years. The first quarter growth was driven by surging land prices and a boom in demand from smaller cities where home purchase conditions are less restrictive.
Some major cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou have seen a surge in the marketing of new home developments over the past two months as authorities reduced curbs, with developers also eager to ramp up the launches to boost their cashflow.
However, growth is expected to cool with a government crackdown on risky borrowing triggering worries about future financing, indicating growing liquidity pressure facing Chinese property developers.
New construction starts measured by floor area, an indicator of developers' confidence, were up only 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, slowing from a sharp jump of 17.8 percent in March, Reuters calculations showed.
In year-to-date terms, property sales rose just 1.3 percent in the first four months, the smallest increase of any January-April period since 2015.
New household loans, mostly mortgages, slowed to 528.4 billion yuan in April from 580 billion yuan in March, according to central bank data released last week.
While demand appears to be softening, a government think tank said on Monday that the property market remains frothy and is still subject to volatility.
China's new home prices rose for their 35th consecutive month in March, with more cities reporting growth as the government supported demand from first-time buyers. The April figures are due on Wednesday.
Zhang Yiping, an analyst with China Merchants Securities said property investment's overall contribution to the real economy has fallen significantly with indicators of market strength - sales and new construction - both dipping.
However, despite the signs of cooling, the pace of growth remains robust.
""The still rapid growth in real estate investment is still mainly thanks to higher land purchases,"" Zhang said. 
Land purchases totaled 24 million yuan during the period, up 13.6 percent from the year earlier, NBS data showed.

98,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 02:44AM ET</span>","Soft China April investment, retail sales suggest economy losing steam","By Kevin Yao and Fang Cheng
BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade row with the United States.
Fixed asset investment grew the slowest since 1999 while the pace of retail sales softened to a four-month low, suggesting a long-anticipated slowdown in the world's second-largest economy may finally be setting in even as protectionism is on the rise.
The lone bright spot on Tuesday's activity data was industrial output, which jumped more than expected as automobile and steel production surged.
""Industrial activity was buoyed by the easing of pollution controls (imposed over the winter). But there are signs in the rest of today’s data that the economy is losing momentum,"" Capital Economics senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note following the data.
""Domestic spending is likely to continue to soften given the headwinds from slowing credit creation,"" he said, adding that the rebound in industry may be short-lived once companies rebuild inventories which were depleted in recent months.
Capital Economics has long predicted Beijing will loosen monetary policy later this year to keep growth from slowing too sharply as it continues a crackdown on financial risks.
Industrial output rose 7.0 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said, beating forecasts for a rise of 6.3 percent and up from a seven-month low of 6.0 percent in March.
NO TRADE HIT YET
Sino-U.S. trade frictions have yet to show an impact on China's economy, the statistics bureau said. 
But while April exports and imports were surprisingly solid, business surveys point to a sharp weakening in export order growth, possibly as companies grow worried about being stuck with high inventories if the U.S. and China start imposing tit-for-tat tariffs.
Analysts also suspect some firms may be rushing out shipments to beat any punitive trade measures, flattering the most recent export figures but blunting future gains.
Washington and Beijing will resume trade negotiations this week, after initial talks earlier this month appeared to make little progress in narrowing their differences.
SLOWING INVESTMENT, SOFTENING DEMAND
Investment growth slowed pretty much across the board, adding to views that rising borrowing costs -- a byproduct of the regulatory crackdown on riskier lending -- are finally starting to drag on activity.
Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 7.0 percent in January-April from a year earlier, versus forecasts of only a slight dip to 7.4 percent. Growth in April cooled to around 6 percent, analysts estimated.
Private sector investment growth moderated to 8.4 percent, from 8.9 percent in the first three months. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China and has rebounded this year as spending by heavily-indebted state firms slows.
Growth in infrastructure spending, a powerful economic driver last year, slowed to 12.4 percent in the first four months from 13 percent earlier in the year. 
That trend is likely to continue as Beijing forces local governments to scale back spending to contain their debt, and as home sales cool due to strict government controls to fight speculation and tame home prices.
China's property market, another key growth driver, is also showing signs of fatigue as mortgage rates rise.
Real estate investment rose 10.2 percent in April on-year, slowing from a 10.8 percent rise in March, according to Reuters calculation based on the official data.
Property sales by floor area fell 4.1 percent in April, the biggest drop in six months, compared with a 3.2 percent rise in March. New construction starts also slowed sharply.
For the first four months of the year, sales grew just 1.3 percent.
The property slowdown is weighing on consumption, filtering through to weaker demand for home appliances and furniture.
Retail sales growth slowed to 9.4 percent in April, missing forecasts for a 10.0 percent gain and off March's pace of 10.1 percent.
SLOWDOWN
While China's official data suggests economic growth has been remarkably steady at 6.8-6.9 percent over the past year, 
analysts have stuck to their forecasts that it will gradually lose steam in coming months, even without any trade shocks.
Economists polled by Reuters expect a slowdown to around 6.5 percent this year, which is also the government's target.
But a few China watchers believe activity has already slackened much more, although they are in the minority.
UK-based Fathom Consulting's momentum gauge ended the first quarter at 5.9 percent, while Capital Economics reckons growth slowed to 4.8 percent at the start of 2018 as policy tightened. 
With trade frictions rising, there are signs that Beijing is already moving to a more supportive policy stance to ensure growth doesn't slow too much.
The politburo, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party, said in April China will strive hard to achieve 2018 economic targets and will boost domestic demand.
The central bank last month unexpectedly cut reserve requirement ratios (RRR) for most banks hours after soft March data, a move that was earlier and more aggressive than expected.
While the central bank insists it has not shifted its ""neutral"" policy stance, economists believe further RRR cuts are likely as policymakers look to offset the impact on companies from higher financing costs and any trade fallout.
Nomura believes Beijing will continue special lending programs to support homebuyers in smaller cities and speed up its fiscal spending.
The weighted average lending rate for non-financial firms, a key indicator reflecting corporate funding costs, rose 22 basis points in the first quarter to 5.96 percent, the People's Bank of China said in its quarterly report on Friday.

The preliminary publication of the data for May from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment held steady at 98.8 last month.
Analysts had forecast a drop to 98.5.
The current conditions indicator decreased to 113.3 in May, from the previous 114.9.
Economists had projected that the index would rise to 115.7.
Additionally, consumer expectations unexpectedly increased to 89.5 in May, from the prior reading of 88.4.
That beat consensus that had expected a decline to 88.0.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 2.8% from 2.7%, while the five-year gauge held steady at the previous 2.5%.
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that the data will provide some additional points for both sides in the debate about the timing and number of future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
According to the date, eight out of every 10 consumers anticipated interest rate hikes during the year ahead, and fewer consumers anticipated further declines in the unemployment rate, instead expecting joblessness to stabilize.
“Consumers have a remarkable track record for anticipating changes in the actual unemployment rate,” Curtin commented.
“Overall, the data are consistent with a growth rate of 2.7% in real personal consumption from the second half of 2018 to first half of 2019,” he concluded."
101,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>","U.S. import prices, surveys point to moderate inflation","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices rose less than expected in April as a rebound in the cost of petroleum products was tempered by a drop in food prices, the latest indication that inflation pressures were increasing moderately.
The Labor Department said on Friday import prices gained 0.3 percent last month after falling 0.2 percent in March. The report came on the heels of data this week showing benign monthly consumer and wholesale price readings in April.
""Import prices are consistent with our view that domestic inflation pressures will continue to gradually develop,"" said Kathryn Asher, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Signs of a moderate build-up of price pressures suggest the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually raise interest rates even as inflation is flirting with the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, accelerated 1.9 percent year-on-year in March after rising 1.6 percent in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.5 percent in April. In the 12 months through April, import prices increased 3.3 percent, matching March's gain.
With oil prices surging in recent days, economists expect monthly inflation measures to push higher in the coming months. 
Crude prices were trading near 3-1/2-year highs on Friday as the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Iran tightened the outlook for Middle East supply at a time when global crude production is only just keeping pace with rising demand.
President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and promised tough sanctions against Tehran. 
The moderate inflation theme was also highlighted in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, which showed households' inflation expectations over the next 12 months edging up to 2.8 percent in early May from 2.7 percent in April. Their longer-term inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.5 percent.
Another survey from the Philadelphia Fed saw the core PCE price index averaging 2.0 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous forecast of 1.9 percent. Inflation was seen averaging 2.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters.
""Inflation is running neither too hot nor too cold,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It is running just right for rate hikes every other meeting.""
The Fed raised interest rates in March and has forecast at least two more hikes for this year. U.S. stocks were trading higher while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell marginally. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
FOOD PRICES FALL
Last month, prices for imported petroleum rebounded 1.6 percent after declining 2.2 percent in March. Excluding petroleum, import prices edged up 0.1 percent in April after being unchanged in the prior month. Import prices excluding petroleum rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through April.
The cost of imported food fell 0.4 percent in April, declining for a second straight month, while prices for imported capital goods were unchanged. The cost of imported motor vehicles nudged up 0.1 percent. 
Import prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials increased 0.7 percent after jumping 1.0 percent in March. They were driven by a 4.0 percent surge in the prices of iron and steel mill products. Trump imposed a 25 percent import tariff on steel in March to shield domestic producers from what he said was unfair competition.
The cost of goods imported from China slipped 0.1 percent in April, the first drop in seven months, after rising 0.2 percent in March. Prices increased 0.2 percent in the 12 months through April.
The Labor Department report also showed export prices accelerated 0.6 percent in April after gaining 0.3 percent in March. Prices for agricultural products fell 1.2 percent last month, the first drop since December 2017, weighed down by lower prices for soybeans, nuts and wheat.

Export prices increased 3.8 percent on a year-on-year basis, the largest gain since November 2011, after rising 3.4 percent in March. Prices for nonagricultural exports gained 0.7 percent last month, boosted by a 1.5 percent jump in industrial supplies and materials prices.

103,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Japan economy seen shrinking for first time in two years in first quarter,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is expected to have contracted for the first time in two years in the first quarter due to weak private consumption and softer export demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
A negative reading, while slight, would snap Japan's longest period of economic expansion -- eight straight quarters of growth - since its 1980s bubble economy.
But analysts said the expected January-March weakness may be only a temporary soft patch, arguing that higher prices for fresh vegetables and bad winter weather likely weighed on consumer spending in the quarter.
The global economy also has remained firm, suggesting Japan will regain traction in the second quarter, they added.
Gross domestic product (GDP) probably shrank at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter after a 1.6 of expansion in the final quarter of 2017, the poll of 18 analysts showed.
That would mark the first contraction in the world's third-largest economy since late 2015.
The annualized contraction would translate into a flat reading from the previous quarter. 
""The economy had steadily recovered but it appeared to have come to a temporary standstill,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Economic indicators such as factory output and firms' business sentiment have shown a softening momentum of the economy. The GDP data will likely reflect those moves.""
Analysts believe there was no growth in private consumption in the quarter, after a 0.5 percent gain in the final quarter last year. Private consumption accounts for 60 percent of GDP.
External demand - or exports minus imports - also provided no contribution to GDP, the poll found. Japan's exports rose less than expected in March and a business survey showed export order growth slowed sharply in April due to a stronger yen. 
Capital spending was forecast to rise 0.4 percent in the quarter, slowing from a 1.0 percent increase in the previous period but still up for a sixth straight quarter.
""The economy is expected to return to the pace of around annualized 1.0 percent growth from April-June but we need to pay attention to impacts from the United States' trade protectionism including the currency movements,"" said Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
The Cabinet Office will publish the GDP data on May 16 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, May 15).
MACHINERY ORDERS, CORE CPI
The poll also predicted machinery orders fell 3.0 percent in March from the previous month, when they grew 2.1 percent. The highly volatile data series is regarded as an indicator of capital spending in six to nine months.
It would be the first decline in three months after a 2.1 percent growth in February and a 8.2 percent jump in January.
Still, machinery orders likely rose for the third straight quarter in Jan-March versus the previous quarter, analysts say.
""Capital spending is staying solid despite the bearish tone of domestic and overseas economies and it will likely retain its positive movement,"" said an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities in the survey.
The machinery order data will be released at 8:50 a.m. on May 17.
The poll also found the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.8 percent in April from a year earlier, a touch less than the 0.9 percent gain seen in March.
Core CPI is due out at 8:30 a.m. on May 18.

The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, likely grew 2.0 percent in April.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest gain since February 2017, after rising 2.4 percent March.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after two straight monthly increases of 0.2 percent. The so-called core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in April, matching March's increase.
Economists had forecast the CPI rebounding 0.3 percent in April and the core CPI climbing 0.2 percent.
The Federal Reserve tracks a different inflation measure, which is now flirting with the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy accelerated to 1.9 percent year-on-year in March as last year's big declines in the price of cell phone service plans dropped out of the calculation.
Economists expect the core PCE price index, which had increased 1.6 percent in February, to breach its target in May.
Gasoline prices rebounded 3.0 percent in April after tumbling 4.9 percent in March.
Further increases are likely after crude oil prices jumped to 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision on Tuesday to pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran.
Food prices rose 0.3 percent last month after nudging up 0.1 percent in March. Food consumed at home increased 0.3 percent, the biggest gain since March 2017.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in March.
But healthcare costs nudged up 0.1 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in March, helping to restrain the increase in the core CPI. Prices for used cars and trucks tumbled 1.6 percent in April, the largest drop since March 2009.

The cost of recreation fell 0.4 percent last month, the biggest decline since December 2009. Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent in April after falling 0.6 percent in the prior month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in April, suggesting that inflation was increasing at a moderate pace, which could allow the Federal Reserve to continue gradually raising interest rates.
But with the labor market tightening and oil prices rising after President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal, promising to restore stiff sanctions on Iran, price pressures are expected to accelerate in the coming months.
Inflation is flirting with the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. Policymakers have in recent days signaled they would not be too concerned if inflation overshot the target, reiterating what the Fed said in its statement last week.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in April as increases in the cost of gasoline and rents were tempered by a drop in motor vehicle prices. The CPI had slipped 0.1 percent in March. 
""The sources of the weakness in last month's reading do not suggest the onset of a trend shift lower,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Today's number would not deter the Fed from hiking (interest rates) again next month.""
In the 12 months through April, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest gain since February 2017. That followed a 2.4 percent rise in the year to March.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after two successive monthly increases of 0.2 percent. The so-called core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in April, matching March's increase.

Economists expect the core PCE price index, which had increased 1.6 percent in February, to breach the 2 percent target in May.
In their policy statement last week, Fed officials said they expected annual inflation to run close to the ""symmetric"" 2 percent target over the medium term. The central bank left interest rates unchanged last week.
The Fed hiked rates in March and has signaled at least two more increases for this year. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while U.S. Treasury yields fell. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies.
SKILLS MISMATCH
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department's first-time applications for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended May 5. Claims dropped to 209,000 during the week ended April 21, which was the lowest level since December 1969.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the unemployment rate close to a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent. That has led to a slowdown in job growth as employers struggle to find skilled workers. A government report on Tuesday showed job openings rising to a record 6.6 million in March.
Competition for workers is expected to push up wage increases, which have remained moderate.

Consumer price inflation rose by an annualized 2.5% last month the Labor Department said, from 2.4% in the previous month.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, rose 2.1% year-on-year. Economists were looking for a gain of 2.2%.
Month-on-month, CPI rose 0.2%, against forecasts for a reading of 0.3%, while core CPI rose 0.1% from a month earlier.
Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.
Inflation remains a central concern for markets as increasing price pressures would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently forecast.

108,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Subdued UK industrial output data caps glum first quarter for economy,"LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - British industrial output barely rose in March, confirming a glum first quarter for the economy that looks likely to scupper a Bank of England interest rate hike later on Thursday.
The data, released along with figures for the construction industry and overseas trade, did nothing to alter the picture of an economy that has struggled for momentum in recent months.
While heavy snow storms swept through Britain in early March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) stuck with its earlier judgment that this had little overall impact on the economy's performance in the first three months of 2018.
The ONS said industrial output inched up by 0.1 percent month-on-month in March, the same pace as in February and slightly below the consensus for growth of 0.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. 
British data have mostly soured over the past month, forcing investors to ax widespread bets that the BoE will raise interest rates this month.
The BoE, which did not have early access to Thursday's data, announces its decision at 1100 GMT. 
Almost all economists polled by Reuters think the weak run of data will dissuade the central bank from raising rates this time, at least until August. 
""Today's figures support previous estimates showing the economy was very sluggish in the first quarter of 2018, with little impact overall from the bad weather,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
A lack of clarity around Britain's terms of departure from the European Union in less than a year, as well as a slowing euro zone economy, are among reasons cited for Britain's disappointing performance of late.
The ONS said the impact from Thursday's data on its preliminary estimate of first quarter economic growth -- which showed only a 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter increase -- was negligible.
Manufacturing output, which was a bright spot last year thanks to the strong global economy, edged lower for a second month running, dropping by a monthly 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent fall in February.
Economists had expected a fall of 0.2 percent. 
Separate ONS data showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world increased to 12.287 billion pounds in March from 10.414 billion pounds in February -- at the top end of forecasts that had pointed to a gap of 11.25 billion pounds.
Nonetheless, the ONS indicated that net trade was likely make a very small positive contribution to economic growth in the first quarter. 
The ONS also released figures for construction output, which fell 2.3 percent on the month in March, after a fall of 1.0 percent in February -- more or less as expected in the Reuters poll.
On the year, construction output was down 4.9 percent in March, the biggest annual drop since January 2013.

110,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",China Factory Inflation Pauses Slide as Consumer Prices Ease,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation gained pace, snapping a five-month streak of declines, while the consumer price index eased.
The producer price index rose 3.4 percent in April from a year earlier, in line with the estimate in a Bloomberg survey and up from 3.1 percent in March. The consumer price index climbed 1.8 percent, the statistics bureau said Thursday, versus a forecast 1.9 percent gain and prior reading of 2.1 percent.
Producer inflation pressures remain broadly on an easing trend since reaching an eight-year high in February 2017. In recent months solid external demand has helped underpin the economic expansion even as the trade tensions with the U.S. add uncertainty to the outlook.
“Inflation remains well-behaved,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in a Bloomberg Television interview. “This means that monetary policy will remain steady. Benchmark rates will not be changed this year and rates used in open-market operations will be moved only marginally higher in lockstep with the Fed in terms of timing but by much smaller increments.”
Despite a PPI acceleration from a year earlier influenced by a low base, factory prices fell from a month earlier, signaling that a turning point for the moderation in the headline index may not have been reached just yet.
“Inflation pressure will pick up in coming months, but won’t rise to the level that would affect monetary policy,” said Zhu Qibing, chief macro-economy analyst at BOC International China Ltd. in Beijing. “PPI may continue to rebound on supply-side reforms and pollution curbs.”
A gauge of raw materials producer prices picked up to 5.7 percent from 5.1 percent, while indexes for manufacturing and mining also gained. Consumer inflation for food slowed to 0.7 percent from 2.1 percent. A gauge for consumer goods edged lower.

112,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",China April producer inflation picks up for first time in seven months,"By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer inflation picked up for the first time in seven months in April, bolstered by surging commodities prices and suggesting its industrial demand remains resilient even as trade tensions ratchet up with the United States.
But consumer inflation eased from the previous month as food prices rose at a slower pace, official data showed on Thursday.
Analysts and investors are closely watching inflation gauges in China for signs of a long-expected economic slowdown that would weigh on industrial profit growth and investment and possibly tip a shift in central bank policy.
But the country's commodity futures markets are notoriously speculative, making it difficult to tell if producer price swings are pointing to a real change in underlying demand. 
The producer price index (PPI) rose 3.4 percent in April from a year ago, accelerating from a 17-month low of 3.1 percent in March, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday. On a month-on-month basis, it declined 0.2 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer inflation would rebound to 3.5 percent as steel mills stocked up on raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal to meet a seasonal surge in construction. Oil prices have also been on the rise.
Sharper factory-gate price rises could bolster profits for industrial firms, which saw earnings growth slow to the weakest pace in over a year in March.
CONSUMER INFLATION EASES 
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier, just below expectations and slowing from March's 2.1 percent. On a month-on-month basis, it dipped 0.2 percent.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.0 percent in April, unchanged from March.
    The food price index rose 0.7 percent on-year, after rising 2.1 percent in March, as distortions from the long Lunar New Year holiday receded. Non-food prices rose 2.1 percent, the same pace as the previous month. 
Pork prices in April declined 16.1 percent on-year, most likely due to a glut in the market.
""The decline in pork prices in April dragged the headline number lower by 0.4 percentages points,"" said David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist at ANZ. ""But I don't think the softness in pork prices is sustainable. We will most likely see a rebound sometime in the second half this year.""
TRADE WAR A RISK TO INFLATION
While neither Washington nor Beijing has set a hard timeframe for the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs, there are worries that the threat of disruptions and higher costs could start to add upward pressure on inflation in China that would be felt from factory floors to farms.
Pork prices, for example, which have a large weighting in the consumer inflation basket, could soar if feed costs continue to rise. China imposed a hefty duty on imports of U.S. sorghum last month and has threatened high tariffs on U.S. soybeans.
But analysts still expect broader price pressures will moderate this year as higher borrowing costs and a cooling property market lead to a softening in economic activity. 
China has set an inflation goal of 3 percent for 2018, the same target as last year. Most market watchers expect full-year CPI to be in the low- to mid-2 percent range, picking up from 2017 but still well within the central bank's comfort zone. 
Mild inflationary pressures had been expected to give Chinese policymakers plenty of room to continue their crackdown on riskier lending this year, which has been pushing up companies' financing costs.
But China's central bank last month cut reserve requirement ratios (RRR) for most banks, sparking fears that economic momentum may already be starting to slow.
That has prompted speculation that China is considering shifting monetary policy from a slightly tighter bias to a somewhat looser stance, as the threat of a trade war with the United States adds to the risks facing the world's second-largest economy in coming months.
""Today's inflation data point to easing price pressures, consistent with our view that inflation is already past its peak for the current economic cycle,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note after the data.
""Softening price pressures should give the People's Bank ample room to loosen monetary policy later this year in response to cooling economic activity.""

Despite a stronger-than-expected first quarter, economists polled by Reuters still expect China's economic growth to cool to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices barely rose in April after strong gains in the first quarter, held back by a moderation in the cost of services such as hotel accommodation and healthcare, which could ease fears that inflation pressures were rapidly building up.
The slowdown in wholesale price growth reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday is, however, likely temporary as manufacturers have been reporting paying more for raw materials. Economists also expect oil prices to surge after President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran.
""Inflation isn't breaking out, although with Trump exiting the Iran nuclear deal, higher energy prices could kick-start a new round of inflation at the producer level,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in March. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 2.6 percent from 3.0 percent in March.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.2 percent last month and rising 2.8 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services also nudged up 0.1 percent last month. The so-called core PPI had increased by 0.4 percent in each of the past three months. 
In the 12 months through April, the core PPI rose 2.5 percent after jumping 2.9 percent in March. 
Core goods prices increased 0.3 percent in April, matching March's gain. Prices for intermediate processed goods increased 0.5 percent while the cost of unprocessed goods shot up 0.9 percent.
""There is building pressure in the pipeline,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with shares of energy companies getting a boost from surging oil prices after the United States exited the Iran nuclear deal and imposed the 'highest level' of sanctions against the OPEC member. 
Crude prices rose to 3-1/2-year highs. U.S. Treasury yields rose while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
INFLATION NEAR TARGET
Inflation is flirting with the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.9 percent year-on-year in March and is expected to breach its target in the coming months. 
This comes as last year's big declines in prices of cell phone service plans drop out of the calculation.
Fed officials have in recent days signaled they would not be too concerned if inflation overshot the central bank's target, reiterating a message in a statement issued at the end of a two-day policy meeting last Wednesday. 
In that statement, policymakers said they expected annual inflation to run close to the ""symmetric"" 2 percent target over the medium term. The U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged last week. The Fed hiked rates in March and has forecast at least two more increases for this year. 
In April, the price of services ticked up 0.1 percent. That followed two straight monthly increases of 0.3 percent. 
Services were restrained by a 3.2 percent drop in the cost of hotel accommodation, which was the biggest decline since September 2009. The cost of healthcare services fell 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in March. Those costs feed into the core PCE price index.
Prices for goods were unchanged last month after rising 0.3 percent in March. Wholesale food prices declined 1.1 percent last month, the largest drop since August 2016, after surging 2.2 percent in March. 
Food prices were weighed down by sharp declines in the cost of vegetables, eggs and unprocessed finfish.
Gasoline prices fell 0.4 percent in April after dropping 3.7 percent in the prior month.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased less than initially estimated in March amid declines in the stocks of motor vehicles and a range of other goods. 
Stocks at wholesalers rose 0.3 percent instead of the 0.5 percent gain it reported last month. They increased 0.9 percent in February.

""We expect to see more inventory building in the second quarter, which will be a net add to U.S. GDP growth,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's consumer economy failed to rebound in April after snowy weather kept shoppers at home the month before, adding to downbeat data that make a Bank of England rate rise this week unlikely.
In a latest sign of slow growth in 2018, retail spending contracted by 3.1 percent year-on-year in April after a 2.3 percent rise in March, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said on Wednesday.
That marked the sharpest drop since records began in 1995.
While the plunge partly reflects the timing of the sales-boosting Easter holidays -- which started in March this year rather than April -- the BRC warned of a weak underlying trend.
Marc Ostwald, market strategist at ADM Investor Services, said the figures were ""dismal"".
British data have soured over the past month, suggesting the economy has not yet recovered from a weak start to 2018 in the manner most economists and BoE officials had expected.
A lack of clarity around Britain's terms of departure from the European Union in less than a year, as well as a slowing euro zone economy, are among reasons cited for Britain's disappointing performance of late.
The BoE now looks unlikely to raise rates on Thursday, according to a new Reuters poll of economists who have mostly pushed back forecasts for a rate hike to August. [BOE/INT]
Adding to mixed signals, a survey of recruitment firms on Wednesday showed demand for permanent staff grew at the weakest pace so far this year during April, though growth in starting salaries remained robust.
RETAIL ""IN DISTRESS"" 
Looking at retail sales over the three months to April, which smoothes out March's jump and last month's plunge, the BRC said overall spending was up just 0.4 percent year-on-year.
That marked the third-worst reading since the global financial crisis.
The BRC said the retail market was likely to remain ""extremely challenging"". Earlier on Wednesday, baker  Greggs  (L:GRG) warned profit for 2018 was likely to disappoint, blaming a dip in consumer demand.
Already this year Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality have filed for protection from creditors.
""The retail industry is clearly in distress,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics.
Separately, payment card firm Barclaycard said consumer spending -- which includes a broader range of purchases such as holidays and eating out -- rose at an annual pace of 3.4 percent in April after growing just 2.0 percent in the previous month.
Excluding the snow-hit March, April marked the weakest increase in five months.

""The UK seems to be caught in a holding pattern, with people still budgeting carefully,"" Barclaycard managing director Paul Lockstone said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in March, suggesting that a recent slowdown in hiring was probably the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed more workers voluntarily quit their jobs in March, a sign of confidence in the labor market that economists believe will help to push up wage growth this year.
The JOLTS report bolsters expectations that inflation will accelerate and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least two more times this year. The U.S. central bank hiked interest rates in March.
""The labor market is hot and getting hotter by the day so central bankers need to continue to take the punch bowl away because higher wages and greater inflation are on the way,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 472,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.6 million. March's job openings were the highest since the data series started in December 2000. For a graphic see: https://reut.rs/2K3daHP
The job openings rate rose three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.2 percent, also an all-time high. But hiring fell to 5.4 million from 5.5 million in February, suggesting a skills mismatch. Job growth slowed in March and April after increasing by the most in more than 1-1/2 years in February.
The skills mismatch was also corroborated by an NFIB survey on Tuesday showing lack of qualified workers as ""the single most important problem"" for a fifth of small businesses in April. 
""Businesses are looking for workers in just about every nook and cranny of the economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
FASTER WAGE INFLATION SEEN
There were 112,000 additional vacancies in the professional and business services industries. The construction industry had 68,000 more job openings and companies in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector had 37,000 unfilled positions.
In March, job openings were concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast regions. There was 1.0 unemployed worker per job opening in March. The unemployment rate fell to a near 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent in April.
About 3.3 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in March, up from 3.2 million in February. 
As a result, the quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 2.3 percent. Quits accounted for a record 62 percent of separations in March. At the depths of the recession, they made up just a third. For a graphic see: https://reut.rs/2K4WEae
""Quits are also a source of upward pressure on wages,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The majority of workers who voluntarily change jobs receive a pay bump, generating stronger wage growth for job switchers.""
Wage growth as measured by average hourly earnings has remained moderate, increasing 2.6 percent year-on-year in April. But other gauges of wage growth have been more robust.
The Employment Cost Index, widely seen by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack, showed wages rising at their fastest pace in 11 years in the first quarter. 

Layoffs fell 56,000 to 1.56 million in March.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A stronger-than-expected rebound in German industrial output in March, and a jump in exports in the same month, helped ease concerns on Tuesday that growth in Europe's biggest economy could have come to a standstill at the start of the year.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial production rose 1.0 percent on the month, the strongest increase since November and above expectations of a 0.8 percent rise.
Seasonally adjusted exports were up 1.7 percent while imports fell 0.9 percent, widening Germany's disputed trade surplus to 22 billion euros ($26.20 billion) in March, it said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Germany's export strength, arguing that U.S. import tariffs would protect American manufacturing jobs and reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Germany and other EU countries.
The bullish output and export figures brought some relief after weak data for January and February pointed to a massive slowdown in the first quarter.
""Rebounding exports and industrial production show that talk of a downswing has been premature,"" ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said.
But given the first two disappointing months, overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter, due next week, is likely to come in weaker than the 0.6 percent registered in the final three months of 2017.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Andreas Rees said the data pointed to a quarterly growth rate of up to 0.4 percent. ""Maybe this is just a blip in the first quarter, but this weaker performance could also continue in spring,"" Rees added.
The outlook for German exporters has clouded as factories face headwinds from rising protectionism and a stronger euro. This was also reflected in data on Monday which showed industrial orders dropped for a third month running in March due to weak foreign demand.
A string of unexpectedly weak economic data had pointed to a cooling in the euro zone economy as a whole, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to begin scaling back in its unprecedented monetary stimulus later this year.
CALM PHASE
In the first quarter as a whole, German industrial production edged up 0.1 percent on the quarter, the economy ministry said.
""After the strong performance in the course of 2017, production in manufacturing took a breather in the first quarter,"" the ministry said.
The ministry blamed the weak start to the year on a flu epidemic, an unusually high number of strikes and an above-average number of holidays over Easter falling in March.
""After a calm phase, industrial output will gain momentum in the course of the year,"" the ministry said, pointing to full order books and favorable economic conditions for trade.
The DIW economic institute has said it expected economic growth to slow down to 0.4 percent in the first quarter and bounce back to around 0.7 percent in the second.
ING's Brzeski agreed there was little reason to doubt the underlying strength of Germany's current upswing, which is now in its ninth year.
The biggest domestic problem for the German economy is that factories are struggling to further boost production, he said, pointing to record employment and widespread labor shortages as well as filled order books and capacity constraints.
""Against this background, more investment seems to be the best and easiest way forward. It would increase production capacity and could lift the current speed limits,"" he added.

Exports denominated in yuan rose 3.7% in April from a year earlier, while imports rose 11.6%, resulting in a trade surplus of 182.8 billion yuan ($28.72 billion) for the period. These are compared to the 5.9% gain in imports and a decline of 9.8% in exports in March. 
In dollar terms, exports in April rebounded from a drop in March and rose 12.9%, while imports surged 21.5%. 
Analysts had previously expected exports in dollar terms to rise 6.3% on year, while import growth was expected to pick up to 16%. 
The data came after the U.S.-China trade talks last week in Beijing, where the U.S. asked China to cut the trade deficit by at least $200 billion by 2020. 
“We don’t expect all core differences in the U.S.-China trade relationship to be resolved,” Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong, wrote in a recent report. “Lingering trade tension and uncertainty will likely negatively affect China’s export orders and related business investment.” 
China’s export outlook is being clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the United States as well as a potential full-scale trade war, as the two nations threatened each other with tariffs since the beginning of the year. 
The impact of the data on equities seemed to be limited however, as the Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component traded 0.9% and 0.7% higher respectively by 12:10AM ET (04:10 GMT). "

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rebounded more strongly than expected in April after a surprise drop the previous month, suggesting global demand remains relatively resilient and providing a cushion to the economy amid a heated trade dispute with the United States.
Imports in April also grew more robustly than expected, signaling China's domestic demand is holding up well, good news for policymakers looking to soften the blow from any trade shocks. 
Some analysts, however, warned the strong April showing was mostly seasonal and that the global export recovery may have already topped out.
""Shipments still look healthy but today’s data does point to a softening in external demand recently,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 
""The backdrop of the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U.S. is one in which global growth has already peaked and China’s export performance is waning as a result."" 
The world's two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars' worth of exports in recent months, leading to worries that Washington and Beijing may plunge into a full-scale trade war that could damage global growth and roil financial markets. 
China's April exports rose 12.9 percent from a year earlier, beating analysts' forecasts for a 6.3 percent increase and snapping back from a 2.7 percent drop in March that economists believe was heavily distorted by seasonal factors.
The heated row with Washington and threats of tit-for-tat punitive measures on trade and investment have added to existing concerns about an economic slowdown in China this year as Beijing continues its campaign to reduce risks to the country's financial system.
High-level discussions between the two sides in Beijing last week appeared to make little substantive progress in defusing trade tensions apart from an agreement to hold more talks.
China's top economic official will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks with the Trump administration, the White House said on Monday.
A Reuters report citing sources said China had offered to buy more U.S. goods and lower tariffs on some goods, including cars.
But the Trump administration has drawn a hard line, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States by 2020, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, according to people familiar with the top-level U.S.-China talks last Friday.
Highlighting the challenge of significantly reducing that gap any time soon, China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $22.19 billion in April, from $15.43 billion in March, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Tuesday.
For January-April, it rose to $80.4 billion, from about $71 billion in the same period last year.
China's exports to the United States rose 9.7 percent in April from a year earlier, slowing from a 14.8 percent rise in the first quarter. Its imports from the U.S. rose 20.3 percent in April, the fastest growth in three months.
Export growth was led by a 20.7 percent increase in shipments of high-tech products, led by mobile phone exports.
Economists at ANZ believe some Chinese exporters may be accelerating electronics shipments amid the tariff threats.
China's move to higher-value exports is clear, with shipments of lower-end products like shoes and apparel declining year-on-year, but its strategic tech sector is firmly in the cross hairs of the White House.
STRONG IMPORTS
China's April imports also grew strongly, suggesting its domestic demand remains resilient despite rising corporate borrowing costs and cooling property sales.
Imports grew 21.5 percent on-year, beating analysts' forecast of 16 percent growth, and accelerating from a 14.4 percent rise in March.
Once again, commodities led the way, with imports of soybeans and crude oil rising in April from the previous month, though imports of iron ore and coal fell.
That left China with a trade surplus of $28.78 billion for the month, compared with forecasts for a $24.7 billion surplus in April and a rare deficit of $4.98 billion in March.
While neither the United States nor China has set a hard timeframe for imposition of tariffs, the threat of disruptions and higher costs may already be altering global trade patterns as well as companies' production and marketing strategies.
Companies in both countries have said that they are adjusting business plans and becoming more cautious in the face of the worsening trade environment and the threat of more tariffs.
China's exports of steel and aluminum both rose in April as U.S. tariffs and sanctions caused a spike in global prices, prompting mills and smelters to send more metal abroad, analysts said.

Meanwhile, China's imports of integrated circuits have surged since the start of the year as the United States threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese goods over allegations of intellectual property theft.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending fell 0.7 percent in March from a year earlier to mark the second straight month of declines, underscoring the view the economy suffered a temporary lull in the first quarter as bad weather hurt consumption.
Wage earners' income slid 3.8 percent in March, posting the third straight month of falls, in a sign firms remain wary of raising pay despite reaping record profits from robust global demand.
Weak consumption would be a headache for the Bank of Japan, which hopes that companies will pass on rising costs to households and help drive up inflation to its 2 percent target.
Household spending slid 0.1 percent in March from February, government data showed on Tuesday.
""There are some weaknesses in the pickup in household spending,"" a government official who briefed reporters said.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, has grown for eight straight quarters through end-2017, the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s.
But core consumer inflation stood at 0.9 percent in March from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target, as slow wage growth keeps consumers from increasing their spending.

Economic growth is expected to show annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the first quarter, but is seen likely to regain some momentum over the course of the year, a Reuters poll showed.

Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 19.2 from 19.6 in April. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a rise to 21.0. The fall was due to both lower economic expectations and investors' slightly weaker assessment of current conditions.
""Uncertainties about the introduction of punitive U.S. tariffs and the danger that this could lead to an expansion of protectionist measures are weighing on us,"" Manfred Huebner, managing director at Sentix, said in a note.
U.S. President Donald Trump has invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China.
A week ago, the White House announced that Trump had extended a temporary reprieve from the tariffs for the European Union, Canada and Mexico until June 1, just hours before they were due to come into force.
In the run-up to a June 1 deadline, Germany is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal that benefits both sides. But that puts Germany at odds with European peers such as France.
A Sentix survey for Germany also fell for the fourth month in a row, hitting its lowest since September 2016.
""The economy in Germany is booming and yet the zenith seems to have passed,"" Huebner said.

Sentix conducted the survey of 974 investors between May 3 to 5.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders unexpectedly dropped for the third month running in March due to weak foreign demand, data showed on Monday, suggesting that factories in Europe's largest economy are facing headwinds from rising protectionism.
Contracts for German goods fell 0.9 percent after a downwardly revised drop of 0.2 percent the previous month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average predicted a 0.5 percent rise in orders.
""A decline of 0.9 percent is a setback, that really hurts,"" VP Bank Group analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
""The economy is slowing down, that's the sure take-away from today's industrial orders data,"" Gitzel said, adding that some growth forecasts would soon have to be revised down.
The government last month cut its 2018 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent and expressed concern about international trade tensions. 
""The debate about tariffs has probably created great uncertainty in Europe's export-driven industry,"" Gitzel added.
As Europe's biggest exporter to the United States, Germany is desperate to avoid an EU trade war with the United States.
In the run-up to a June 1 deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump to decide on whether to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU, Germany is urging its European partners to be flexible and pursue a broad deal that benefits both sides.
In a further sign that the looming tariffs are a concern, investor morale in the euro zone deteriorated for the fourth month in a row in May to hit its lowest level since February 2017 on fears of a protectionist spiral, a survey showed.
NO MORE XXL
The drop in industrial orders was led by foreign orders which fell by 2.6 percent, while domestic orders rose 1.5 percent, the data showed.
A sector breakdown of the figures showed that demand for capital goods such as machinery and cars fell the most, while orders for consumer goods rose against the trend.
The economy ministry said that the sector had lost some momentum in the first quarter after an unusually strong performance in the previous six months.
In the first quarter of 2018, order intake was down 2.1 percent on the previous quarter, it said.
""Orders from countries outside the euro area decreased significantly,"" the ministry added.
Despite the overall decline in the first three months of the year, the ministry said that companies still had a huge backlog of orders to work through.
The unexpectedly weak figures followed economic data that pointed to a cooling in the euro zone economy, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to begin reining in its lavish monetary stimulus later this year.
""All in all, the data is another confirmation that the growth peak has been passed,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said.
The upswing of the German economy will continue, albeit less dynamically, Krueger said, predicting quarterly growth rates of ""standard size rather than XXL"".
Preliminary gross domestic product data for the first quarter are due out next week from the Federal Statistics Office. Analysts predict the economy grew 0.5 percent on the quarter after 0.6 percent in the last three months of 2017.

The DIW economic institute has said it expected the economy to bounce back in the second quarter after taking a breather at the beginning of the year, blaming the weak start to the year on a flu epidemic, strikes and an above-average number of holidays.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth faded again in April but the picture still remained relatively bright as new business stayed strong and firms managed to build up backlogs of work, a survey showed on Friday.
However, somewhat worrying for policymakers at the European Central Bank as they look to move away from their ultra-loose stance, inflationary pressures eased and the survey hinted at further easing in coming months.
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall indicator of euro zone growth, fell to a 15-month low of 55.1 in April from March's 55.2.
That was a touch below a flash estimate but still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. It was the lowest January 2017.
""Despite the drop, the PMI is not yet at a worryingly low level, but the survey details hint at further easing in the coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the survey was indicative of the euro zone economy growing around 0.5-0.6 percent this quarter. A Reuters poll last month pegged growth at 0.6 percent, faster than the official flash first quarter estimate of 0.4 percent. 
But forward-looking indicators suggested more momentum may be lost. While backlogs of work were again accrued firms did so at a slower rate and this meant an index measuring optimism fell to a five-month low of 65.7 from 66.3.
""Any further deterioration could herald new concerns among policymakers regarding the economic outlook,"" Williamson said.
Composite PMIs for Germany, France and Spain all fell from March readings while France's held steady.
An earlier flash PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry suggested activity there picked up but the final reading showed a fall to 54.7 last month from March's 54.9. The preliminary estimate was 55.0.
April's slowdown came despite service firms raising prices at a shallower rate - the output price index fell to a seven-month low of 51.8 from 52.1.
Official flash data on Thursday showed April inflation unexpectedly slipped to an annual 1.2 percent in the bloc as prices of services increased at a slower pace. The ECB wants inflation just below the 2 percent.
ECB policymakers have been debating whether to end the central bank's 2.55 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) asset purchase scheme but evidence of weakening inflation after a string of downbeat data could make it more difficult for them to curb stimulus.
A Reuters poll found last month said the ECB would end the stimulus this year and hike interest rates in 2019.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) climbed to 52.9 in April from March's four-month low of 52.3, though it remained weaker than levels in 2018's first two months. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were similar to those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector earlier this week, which showed April's services PMI rising to 54.8 from March's 54.6.
Strength in services bodes well for policymakers aiming to boost domestic demand at a time a possible trade war with the United States causes concern there could be a loss of economic momentum in China. 
As the Caixin services survey came out, top-level Trump administration officials are in China for important trade talks. 
The services sector already accounts for more than half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
Growth in new business orders accelerated in April due to improving market conditions, greater tourist numbers and new product offerings. This led to the first back-to-back monthly increase in outstanding work for Chinese services providers since mid-2007, the survey showed.
New projects and efforts to raise operating capacity contributed to a further rise in employment in April, albeit the increase in the growth rate was only marginal.
Inflationary pressures continued to cool across China's service sector as input prices grew at the slowest pace in April in six months while the increase in prices charged by services providers was only modest. 
Business expectations towards the year ahead, improved slightly in April, supported by ongoing company expansions, projects of improving market conditions and increasing client bases.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of firming growth, rising to 52.3 in April from the previous month's 51.8, indicating relatively stable economic growth. 
""The operating conditions of the service sector improved more significantly than the manufacturing sector,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""Overall, expectations regarding future output weakened due to reduced optimism across the manufacturing sector, which may further weigh on investment in the manufacturing industry.""

Economists expect China's economic growth to ease to 6.5 percent this year, in line with Beijing's target but below a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector and the trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.

May 3 - New orders for U.S.-made goods rose more than expected in March, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment and a range of other products, but there are signs that business spending on equipment is slowing.
Factory goods orders rose 1.6 percent, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for February was revised up to show orders jumping 1.6 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 1.4 percent in March. Orders rose 7.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in March.
Orders for transportation equipment increased 7.6 percent, lifted by a 44.5 percent jump in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. Transportation orders rose 8.9 percent in February. Orders for machinery fell 1.9 percent, the largest drop since April 2016, after rising 0.6 percent in February.
Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery surged 2.6 percent. Orders for motor vehicles fell 1.0 percent, the biggest drop since last July. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6 percent while bookings for computers advanced 1.0 percent.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by strong domestic and global demand. But a shortage of skilled workers and rising commodity prices after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are starting to impact production.
A survey on Monday showed sentiment among manufacturers falling in April for a second straight month amid growing concerns about the tariffs, which were imposed by President Donald Trump in March.
Manufacturers said the import duties had increased prices, made it difficult to source material and brought business planning to a standstill. That could undercut business spending on equipment. 
Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries.

The Commerce Department revised March orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, to show them falling 0.4 percent instead of dipping 0.1 percent as reported last month.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 1.0 percent in February. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.8 percent in March instead of the 0.7 percent drop reported last month.
Core capital goods shipments were up 1.2 percent in February.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended April 28, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 209,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since December 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, close to the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged. The Fed said policymakers expected ""economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.""
The Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,750 to 221,500 last week, the lowest level since March 1973.
While the claims report has no bearing on April's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, filings for jobless benefits declined during the month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 192,000 jobs in April after rising 103,000 in March.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 77,000 to 1.76 million in the week ended April 21, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 15,500 to 1.83 million, also the lowest level since December 1973.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in March as exports increased to a record high amid a surge in deliveries of commercial aircraft and soybeans, bolstering the economy's outlook heading into the second quarter.
While other data on Thursday showed a modest increase in new applications for jobless benefits last week, the number of Americans receiving unemployment aid fell to its lowest level since 1973, pointing to tightening labor market conditions. 
Wage growth is also rising, with hourly compensation accelerating in the first quarter. Strengthening wage growth should put upward pressure on inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. 
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and said it expected annual inflation to run close to the Fed's 2 percent target over the medium term. 
""The good news is that we are exporting more, but with the labor markets incredibly tight, labor costs are accelerating as well,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The rise in labor costs will undoubtedly factor into policymakers' thinking when they meet again in June.""
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit tumbled 15.2 percent to a six-month low of $49.0 billion in March. The trade gap widened to $57.7 billion in February, which was the highest level since October 2008.
March's decline ended six straight monthly increases in the trade deficit. The politically sensitive goods trade gap with China dropped 11.6 percent to $25.9 billion, which will probably do little to ease tensions between the United States and China. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion worth of Chinese goods to punish Beijing over its joint-venture requirements and other policies Washington says force American companies to surrender their intellectual property to state-backed Chinese competitors.
China, which denies it coerces such technology transfers, has threatened retaliation in equal measure, including tariffs on U.S. soybeans and aircraft. A U.S. trade delegation arrived in China on Thursday for trade talks. 
Trump, who claims the United States is being taken advantage of by its trading partners, has already imposed broad tariffs on imported solar panels and large washing machines. 
He recently slapped 25 percent import duties on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. But the tariffs and standoff with China are eroding business confidence. The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its national nonmanufacturing index fell for a third straight month in April.
From construction to mining, finance and professional services, businesses complained about the administration's protectionist measures, which they said made ""folks nervous,"" and would ""cause unintended consequences on all industries.""
The Trump administration argues that the perennial trade deficit is holding back economic growth. The economy grew at a 2.3 percent annualized pace in the first quarter, slowing from the October-December period's 2.9 percent rate.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS
Away from the trade uncertainty, prospects for the economy are brightening. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended April 28. 
Claims remained near a more than 48-year low of 209,000 touched during the week ended April 21. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, close to the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 77,000 to 1.76 million in the week ended April 21, the lowest level since December 1973.
Labor market strength is likely to be underscored by April's employment report which is scheduled for release on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March. 
With labor conditions tightening, wage growth is picking up.
Another report from the Labor Department showed hourly worker compensation accelerated at a 3.4 percent rate in the first quarter after rising at a 2.4 percent pace in the October-December period.
""The tight labor market is putting some upward pressure on wages, and this should continue as we look for the unemployment rate to trend lower,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
In March, exports of goods and services increased 2.0 percent to an all-time high of $208.5 billion, lifted by a $1.9 billion increase in shipments of commercial aircraft. There were also increases in exports of soybeans, corn and crude oil. Real goods exports were the highest on record. 
Exports to China jumped 26.3 percent in March.
Imports of goods and services fell 1.8 percent to $257.5 billion, in part as the boost from royalties and broadcast license fees related to the Winter Olympics faded. There were decreases in imports of capital, consumer goods and crude oil. Imports from China fell 2.1 percent in March.

Another report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for U.S.-made goods rose more than expected in March, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment and a range of other products, but business spending on equipment appeared to be slowing.

140,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation slowdown adds to ECB's headache,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation unexpectedly slowed last month, adding to a string of data that could make it more difficult for the European Central Bank to curb its lavish monetary stimulus later this year.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 1.2 percent year-on-year in April. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to be unchanged from March's 1.3 percent.
The weak reading follows disappointing GDP, output, export and sentiment figures, which suggest that euro zone economic growth has peaked after a five-year run and will at best slow to a more moderate level, below optimistic forecasts at the start of the year.
This comes at a sensitive time for the ECB as policymakers are debating whether to end a 2.55 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) bond buying scheme this year, satisfied that healthy growth will eventually raise inflation back to its target of almost 2 percent.
The ECB's bond buying was introduced more than three years ago to revive a euro zone economy that was flagging at the time and push up inflation by flooding the financial system with cash. It is due to run out at the end of September, and policymakers need to decide over the summer whether to shut the programme after several extensions.
But inflation has failed to rise for years according to expectations and in April it missed the ECB's prediction of a rate ""around"" 1.5 percent for the rest of the year.
Perhaps more worryingly for the ECB, all measures of closely-watched underlying inflation fell, indicating that pressures remain weak, despite robust employment growth and a healthy wage deal in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy.
Inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices, the ECB's preferred measure, slowed to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent. The rate excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, an even more narrow measure often looked at by market analysts, eased to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.
The euro extended its recent slide on the data and bond yields fell as investors are pricing in even slower policy normalization by the ECB. While the currency is broadly unchanged this year, it is down 3 percent in the past three months as investors give up expectations that the ECB will tighten policy more aggressively.
The inflation slowdown comes even as crude oil prices (LCOc1) are up around 40 percent from a year earlier, suggesting that inflation would be even weaker with steady energy costs.
While policymakers have played down the impact of the weak growth so far, they are expected to delay their final decision until the last possible moment, assessing whether growth would stabilize or slow further.
The bloc's GDP growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the first quarter from 0.7 percent three months earlier and the European Commission said downside risks to growth have increased.
Still, some policymakers have argued that earlier readings were not sustainable and some moderation was always included in forecasts.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, a longtime critic of the ECB's lavish policies, said that worries over the demised of the upswing were exaggerated and expectations for an ECB rate rise in mid-2019 remained realistic.

141,By Investing.com,"<span>May 03, 2018 05:02AM ET</span>",Euro Zone Inflation Slows in April,"Investing.com - Inflation in the euro zone slowed in April, according to a flash estimate released on Thursday, underlining the case for the European Central Bank’s caution in removing stimulus measures.
The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index fell to 1.2% in April from the same month a year earlier, compared to expectations for a reading of 1.3%.
Core, or underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, fell to an annual rate of 0.7% from 1.0% in the previous month.
The ECB targets inflation of close to but just under 2%.
Sluggish inflation is one reason some policymakers are cautioning against withdrawing stimulus too soon.
Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi said that his overall assessment was one of “caution tempered by an unchanged confidence” that inflation is moving towards the central bank’s target.
In remarks after the ECB’s policy meeting, Draghi acknowledged that the pace of the recovery in the euro zone had moderated since the start of the year, saying there had been “a loss of momentum that is pretty broad based across countries and all sectors”.
Economic growth in the region slowed to an annualized 2.5% in the first quarter according to preliminary data released on Tuesday, down from 2.7% in the previous quarter.
Many analysts now believe that the ECB may wait until July - a month later than previously expected - to give markets updated forward guidance on its plans to begin phasing out its stimulus program."
142,By Investing.com,"<span>May 03, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>","UK Services PMI Picked Up Slightly, Remained Subdued in April","Investing.com - Activity in the UK service sector picked up slightly last month, but remained subdued according to a closely watched business survey released on Thursday.
Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.8 in April, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.5.
Firms noted that subdued consumer spending had held back business activity growth in April.
Meanwhile, concerns about the domestic economic outlook had acted as a brake corporate spending, the report said.
Employment in the sector grew at the slowest rate since March 2017 last month.
The prior month’s reading was 51.7, which was the lowest in more than one-and-a-half years as disruption due to snow and unusually bad weather conditions held back growth in business activity.
Similar surveys earlier in the week showed that while activity in the construction sector rebounded at the fastest pace in five months in April, activity in the manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace in seventeen months.
The report did little to alter the view of investors that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting next week.
“The services survey adds to signs that the rate of economic growth remained disappointingly subdued at the start of the second quarter”, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler Markit.
“The disappointing services data will add to expectations that the MPC will take its finger firmly off the rate hike trigger. Any further slowing will also raise questions as to whether the November rate hike may have been ill-timed.”"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus swelled to a 10-month peak in March as resource exports boasted a bumper run, suggesting the economy sprang ahead in the first quarter after a disappointing end to last year.
Thursday's batch of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics also showed approvals to build new houses hit a three-year high in March and rapid population growth promised to support construction for many months yet.
The country's trade surplus climbed to A$1.53 billion ($1.15 billion) in March, more than double forecasts, while January and February were both revised to show fatter gains.
As a result the surplus for the whole March quarter amounted to A$4 billion, a huge turnaround from the previous quarter's A$1 billion shortfall.
Analysts estimated that could have added around half a percentage point to gross domestic product growth in the quarter, reversing a big drag from the December quarter.
""Importantly, real net exports likely made a positive contribution to growth, whereas we anticipated a broadly neutral impact,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Andrew Hanlan.
""The outlook for exports is also positive, led by LNG as new capacity comes on stream, and by services such as education and tourism in response to strong demand from Asia and complemented by the recent retreat in the Australian dollar.""
Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been on a tear and helped lift exports in the March quarter almost 8 percent above the previous quarter.
Analysts now suspect GDP growth may have doubled in the March quarter to around 0.8-1.0 percent.
That would be welcome news to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has been counting on a marked acceleration this year and next to revive inflation and wages.
It would also please the Liberal National government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull which is due next week to hand down what is likely to be the last annual budget before a general election.
Adding to the upbeat news was a surprisingly steep 2.6 percent rise in approvals to build new homes in March.
Detached houses alone were up more than 10 percent on the year ago, a tonic for growth given they are far quicker to build than apartment towers and involve a much broader range of small businesses.
Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, noted the value of approvals for homes and commercial buildings had climbed to A$126 billion in the year to March, a record high.
""The building pipeline is already choc-a-bloc, but it continues to expand,"" said James.
""Construction companies are already claiming they can't find the staff they need. There will be upward pressure on wages.""

144,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>","Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, says inflation near goal","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U.S. central bank's target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.
The upgrading of the Fed's inflation outlook represented a milestone after roughly six years of price gains falling short of its 2 percent goal, even as key aspects of the economy saw a healthy recovery from the 2007-2009 recession. 
The Fed's rate-setting committee also downplayed a recent slowdown in economic and job growth, saying activity had been expanding at a moderate rate and job gains, on average, had been strong in recent months.
It said inflation had ""moved close"" to its target and that ""on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
The Fed's decision to leave its benchmark overnight lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent was unanimous. Investors had all but ruled out another increase at this week's meeting. 
The Fed raised rates in March and currently forecasts another two increases this year, although an increasing number of policymakers see three as possible. Investors overwhelmingly expect a rate hike at the June 12-13 policy meeting.
After the release of the Fed's statement, traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures kept bets that rates would rise at least two more times in 2018. U.S. stocks pared losses before turning lower, Treasury yields briefly edged higher, and the dollar (DXY) was off its highs of the day against a basket of currencies. 
""There are some changes in the statement to reflect the evolution of the data especially in their inflation outlook,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.
""I think a June rate hike is a done deal unless something dramatically changes between now and June.""
ROBUST ECONOMY 
The Fed's confidence in the economic outlook was also highlighted by its assertion that business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly. It added that risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced, removing a prior reference to ""near-term risks.""
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has maintained that the central bank will pursue a middle-of-the-road approach to monetary policy, continuing to gradually lift rates in the face of a robust economy that had yet to spark a jump in inflation.
But data released on Monday showed price gains are now effectively at the Fed's target.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation soared 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest increase since February 2017, after increasing 1.6 percent in the year through February, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.
Fed policymakers had anticipated the rise and have stressed that their target is not a ceiling and that they will tolerate increases above it without being immediately concerned.
The Fed's pace of rate increases has picked up since it began its tightening cycle in December 2015. It raised rates once in 2016, but lifted borrowing costs three times last year amid a strengthening economy and labor market.
Although economic growth slowed to an annualized rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter, a period that has tended to be weaker in recent years, and job gains cooled in March, a pickup is expected in the months ahead, fueled in part by the Trump administration's tax cuts and fiscal stimulus.
The economy is now in its second-longest expansion since World War Two. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, below the Fed's longer-run estimate of what constitutes full employment, and there are signs wages are moving firmly higher after an extended period of sluggishness.

The Fed's policy statement made no mention of the economic risks posed by mounting trade tensions between the United States and other nations, particularly China. Fed policymakers had flagged the potential negative impact of the conflict in recent public comments, but adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight funds rate unchanged at 1.75% to 2.0% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
At its previous meeting in March, the Fed raised rates by a quarter point and projected two more rate hikes this year, although an increasing number of investors now see three hikes as possible.
The Federal Reserve stuck to its customary narrative of “gradual” rate hikes but acknowledged that inflation was nearing its 2% target, which further cemented investor expectations for a rate hike at the Fed’s next meeting in June.
“The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate,” the Fed said in a statement. “Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”
Analysts said the Federal Reserve's carefully chosen language concerning inflation was a signal that policymakers were expecting inflation to run above target in the coming months but that shouldn't necessarily lead to aggressive monetary policy tightening.
""It's likely that PCE runs a little hotter than 2% over the remainder of the year, but policymakers appear to be trying to tamp down expectations that such a run would warrant a materially faster pace of rate hikes,"" CIBC said following the release of the statement on Wednesday.
The Fed's upbeat outlook on inflation comes as data earlier this week showed that the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.9% in the 12 months through March, just shy of the Fed’s 2% target.
Economic activity will expand at a ""moderate pace"" in the medium term, the Fed said, insisting that risks to the economic outlook appear ""roughly balanced.""
Ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, the Fed expressed confidence in the labor market, anticipating conditions to remain ""strong.""
The labor market has gathered momentum in recent months as data last week showed that wages and salaries recorded their biggest increase in just over a decade in the first quarter."

LONDON (Reuters) - British construction activity rebounded faster than expected last month after succumbing to snow in March, but the upturn did little to alter the view of investors that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged next week.
Wednesday's IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 52.5 in April from 47.0 in March. That was comfortably above the median expectation of 50.5 in a Reuters poll of economists and back above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
Sterling rose from near a three-and-a-half-month low against the dollar before the report.
""Whilst it is improbable that this (data) will bring a rate hike back to the table in next week's BoE meeting, it is a pleasing development nonetheless,"" said David Cheetham, a market analyst for currency brokers XTB Online Trading.
Survey compiler IHS Markit said the recovery was ""somewhat underwhelming"" after the snowstorms dubbed ""the Beast from the East"" hit the sector in late February and early March.
Looking at the PMI over the three months to April, smoothing out a sharp fall in March and a bounce-back last month, the survey showed construction activity was barely growing.
""(The survey) provides an indication that the construction sector has been treading water at the very best in recent months,"" Tim Moore, economist at IHS Markit, said.
Construction accounts for 6 percent of British economic output. A 3.3 percent fall in output in the sector in the first three months of the year was largely responsible for a sharp slowdown in growth for the whole economy.
Official statisticians said the first-quarter weakness appeared to have been caused by more than just snow, and economists are keeping a close eye on whether surveys show a recovery in April, or it there is underlying weakness..
A separate survey covering Britain's manufacturers, which was published on Tuesday, showed growth in that sector slowed to a 17-month low in April, sending sterling below $1.37 for the first time in more than three months.
Even before this week's PMIs and weak overall economic growth data for the January-March period last week, Governor Mark Carney had suggested the BoE might not raise rates to a new post-financial-crisis high of 0.75 percent on May 10.
Wednesday's PMI showed some signs of a brightening mood in construction. Business expectations rose to an 11-month high in April, while new construction orders grew for the first time in four months - albeit barely.
Builders were doing better outside of London, accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson said.
""Today's figures may give the impression the sector is flat-lining, but the truth is that outside of London the housing market is ticking over nicely,"" said Brendan Sharkey, a partner at the firm who focuses on construction and property companies.
The PMI for the much larger services sector is due on Thursday.

149,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 05:51AM ET</span>",Euro zone economy slows as expected in first quarter,"By Robert-Jan Bartunek
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth slowed as expected at the start of 2018, although economists said temporary factors were partly behind the weakness and that the economy should continue to expand strongly this year. 
Gross domestic product across the 19 countries sharing the euro currency expanded by 0.4 percent in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of 2017 and by 2.5 percent year on year, EU statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday. 
Eurostat's preliminary flash estimate was in line with economists' forecasts, but well below the 0.7 percent quarterly rises seen in the previous three quarters.
The growth rate pushed the euro zone behind the United States, but still ahead of Britain, which registered its weakest growth since 2012. 
Economic sentiment data slipped in March but remained broadly unchanged in April, leading analysts to forecast that the euro zone economy will ease back to still-healthy growth levels of about 2 percent year-on-year in the coming quarters.
But it was seen as unlikely to match the 2.5 percent expansion seen in 2017.
""Temporary factors, including unseasonably cold weather, striking workers, short-term bottlenecks and even an outbreak of the flu, appear to have weighed on GDP growth in Q1,"" economists at Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""Given the high level of consumer confidence, we suspect that consumption growth will pick up in Q2 and help to push quarterly GDP growth back to around 0.5 or 0.6 percent.""
Confidence took a dip in part over concerns about a trade war with the United States, which could still be sparked if Washington imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union. A decision on this is due by June 1.

In a separate statement, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was stable in March at 8.5 percent.

Eurostat said the euro area economy grew by an annualized 2.5% in the three months to March. That was down from 2.7% in the fourth quarter and in line with estimates.
The economy expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter.
Speaking after the bank’s latest policy meeting last Thursday, ECB President Mario Draghi acknowledged that the pace of the euro area recovery had moderated since the start of the year, but signaled no change in monetary policy.
Draghi said there had been “a loss of momentum that is pretty broad based across countries and all sectors”.
But he added that his overall assessment was one of “caution tempered by an unchanged confidence” that inflation is moving towards the ECB’s target of just below 2%.
Many analysts now believe that the ECB may wait until July - a month later than previously expected - to give markets updated forward guidance on its plans to begin winding up its stimulus program.
At the same time, a separate report showed that the euro zone unemployment rate remained steady at 8.5% in March."

Research firm Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index to rose to 52.5 in April, compared to forecasts for a reading of 50.5.
The prior month’s reading was 47.00, which was a 20 month low.
Residential work was by far the best performing category of construction activity in April, with the rate of growth reaching its strongest since May 2017 as house building activity resumed following snow disruptions in March.
Weather-related improvements were also seen for commercial building and civil engineering activity, with both areas recording a modest return to growth after marked declines in the previous month.
“A rebound in construction activity was pretty well inevitable after snowfall resulted in severe disruptions on site during March,"" said Tim Moore, associate director at survey compiler Markit.
“While temporary factors make it difficult to gauge underlying momentum, the recovery from March’s low point is somewhat underwhelming and provides an indication that the construction sector has been treading water at the very best in recent months.""
The report came a day after a similar survey showing that activity in the UK manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace in seventeen months in April.
The report saw investors slash expectations for a rate hike from the Bank of England at its upcoming meeting next week after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in the first quarter."

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone factory growth slowed further last month from record highs at the turn of the year, but expansion remained strong as customers largely shrugged off rising prices, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Having outpaced its peers in 2017, growth in the bloc's economy has steadily weakened this year and a March Reuters poll said growth had peaked.
But the economy remains strong and price pressures showed some signs of increasing last month, so the European Central Bank is still likely to move away from its ultra-easy monetary policy this year. 
IHS Markit's April final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc slipped for a fourth month, falling to a 13-month low of 56.2 from March's 56.6, above a preliminary reading of 56.0. Anything over 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and is considered as a good guide to economic health, rose to 56.2 from March's 55.9.
""The manufacturing sector saw growth weaken further at the start of the second quarter, but let's not lose sight of the fact that the overall pace of expansion remains encouragingly solid,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Although growth has slowed markedly compared to the start of the year, December had seen the best performance in over 20 years of survey data collection, with factory activity clearly surging at an unsustainable rate.""
Factory growth slowed in three of the bloc's four biggest economies - Germany, Italy and Spain - but France snapped a streak of three consecutive months of falling readings and picked up, earlier figures showed. 
Gross domestic product figures due later on Wednesday are expected to show the euro zone economy expanded 0.4 percent last quarter, slower than the 0.6 percent achieved in the final three months of 2017. 
The ECB wants inflation just below 2 percent but it held steady at 1.3 percent in April, official data are expected to show on Thursday. However, an output prices PMI suggested factories increased charges faster last month as it rose to 57.5 from 57.3. 
""Anecdotal evidence from the surveys also highlights how demand has been curbed by other issues such as the stronger euro and rising prices,"" Williamson said.
Since the turn of the year, the euro (EUR=) has risen against the dollar, peaking at a gain of almost 5 percent in February - making the bloc's exports more expensive. But those gains have been wiped out in the past fortnight.

153,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",German factory growth slips to nine-month low in April: PMI,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - German manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in nine months in April, a survey showed on Wednesday, as new-orders growth slowed for the fourth consecutive month.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to 58.1 from 58.2 in March. That matched a flash reading and was well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
Despite the fall in the headline index, output rose faster than it had in March, suggesting manufacturing had made a solid start to the second quarter.
Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the drop to a nine-month low was no reason for alarm, after record-high growth at the turn of the year.
""The sector looks to have come off the boil in terms of its rate of growth, though it is still running relatively hot,"" he said.
While the increase in output was robust, new orders booked their smallest gain in 17 months.
""A further slowdown in order books in May would mean some downside risks to the outlook,"" Smith said.
""The survey's forward-looking business confidence gauge has stabilised after falling throughout the opening quarter, to suggest that firms themselves see growth levelling off at a lower rate than those seen in recent months.""

154,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>","China April factory growth edges up marginally, export orders shrink: Caixin PMI","BEIJING, (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up in April as output quickened slightly, a private survey showed on Wednesday, though a decline in export orders reinforced risks to the outlook as firms continued to shed staff while inventories also rose.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) climbed to 51.1 in April from a four-month low of 51.0 in March, and topped economists' forecast for a modest slowdown to 50.9.
While production rose at a slightly faster pace and the headline reading remained above the 50-point mark that divides growth from contraction on a monthly basis, the pace of acceleration was modest. 
Particularly concerning was a sub-index on export orders shrinking for the first time since November 2016. The weak overseas sales reading was also backed up by an official PMI survey which showed shipment orders slowed last month - a worrying sign given the growing risks to the trade sector from a heated Sino-U.S. trade dispute. 
Moreover, overall optimism among Chinese manufacturers dipped to a four-month low in April, with some firms citing concerns over future market conditions and the strength of global demand. 
While the survey didn’t make any reference to the U.S.-China trade row, underlying caution about the outlook reinforced views of an expected slackening in momentum in the world's second-biggest economy. Indeed, the survey showed ""anecdotal evidence"" of softer international demand.
""Overall, operating conditions across China's manufacturing sector continued to improve in April,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
""But uncertainty in exports has increased significantly, and the dependence of the Chinese economy on domestic demand is rising.""
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from a year-long, state-led construction boom as large, government-owned industrial heavyweights.
There was also a further reduction in headcount in April, pressured by soft demand conditions. Input price inflation picked up for the first time since September, likely due to the increases in crude oil prices, CEBM's Zhong said.
This may squeeze the profit margins of manufacturers as output price increases remained soft.
Any prolonged softness in overseas demand is likely to put intense pressure on China Inc., which helped the economy deliver solid growth last year thanks to increased government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports. 
Signs of stress have already started to emerge in softer industrial demand, slower investment growth and a subdued property market, leaving policymakers walking a tight rope as they try to defuse debt risks without imperilling growth. So far, with the deleveraging campaign in its third year, Beijing appears to have successfully managed that balancing act.

Economists expect China's economic growth to ease to 6.5 percent this year, in line with Beijing's target but below a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017, with the regulatory crackdown on the country's finance sector and the growing trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.

155,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",New Zealand Unemployment Rate Falls to Lowest in Nine Years,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s jobless rate fell to a fresh nine-year low in the first quarter, adding to signs that sluggish wage growth will eventually pick up.
The jobless rate fell to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent in the previous three months, the lowest since the final quarter of 2008 and in line with economists’ forecasts. Employment rose 0.6 percent and the participation rate fell to 70.8 percent, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday in Wellington.
Lower unemployment and falling immigration may lift wages and start to generate broader price pressures. Still, with inflation languishing near the bottom of the 1-3 percent target range, the Reserve Bank has signaled it’s unlikely to raise interest rates until mid-2019. The government last month gave the central bank the extra goal of supporting maximum sustainable employment alongside price stability.
“The tight labor market currently looks to be in little need of policy stimulus to meet employment objectives” in the RBNZ’s new remit, said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank in Auckland. Still, “the figures depicted a mild wage backdrop, with few signs of widespread wage pressure. This keeps notions of official cash rate hikes on the back-burner,” he said.
New Zealand’s dollar fell after the report. It bought 69.98 U.S. cents at 12:03 p.m. in Wellington from 70.08 cents immediately before the release.
Employment kept pace with the increase in the working-age population, the statistics agency said. The key details were:
Wage inflation was benign with signs of growth emerging in a handful of industries including agriculture and construction, the data showed. The new Labour-led government raised the minimum wage on April 1 and is proposing industrial relations reforms which may fan faster increases in worker incomes, economists say.

But the survey also showed a dip in business confidence as companies struggle to hire workers amid a labor shortage. 
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.5 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis from 50.9 in March.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 19th consecutive month and reached the highest in six months.
""Following successive months of softening output growth through February and March, Japan's service sector started the second quarter by gathering some momentum,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Panelists noted that increased competition and rising labor shortages may impact output potential over the coming 12 months.""
New business expanded at a faster pace than in March, though future business expectations eased to the lowest in seven months. 
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 53.1 from 51.3 in March.
Japanese manufacturing activity also expanded at a faster pace in April, a survey showed on Tuesday, with domestic demand picking up but export order growth slowing sharply due to the stronger yen.
Japan's economy is forecast to have expanded an annualized 0.5 percent in the first quarter as consumer spending and factory output weakened, according to a Reuters poll. That would be a marked slowdown from 1.6 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter.
The world's third-largest economy has grown for eight straight quarters through the end of 2017, the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy.

Some economists are worried that growth could remain sluggish due to a large increase in inventories in the semiconductor and electronic parts sector.

157,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 01:41PM ET</span>","U.S. factory activity slows further, tariff concerns grow","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April, with manufacturers complaining about rising commodity prices in the wake of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Tuesday also showed shortages of skilled workers, which together with the proposed import tariffs were causing bottlenecks in the supply chain. 
Rising raw material costs are the latest indication that inflation pressures are building and could attract the attention of Federal Reserve officials who began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Data on Monday showed a jump in annual inflation rates in March. In addition, wages grew at their quickest pace in 11 years in the first quarter.
""It supports our view that the Fed will raise interest rates three additional times this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is underestimating the amount of developing inflation pressures.""
The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The Fed increased borrowings costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year.
The ISM said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.3 last month from 59.3 in March. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The survey's prices paid index increased 1.2 points to 79.3, the highest reading since April 2011. Last month, price increases occurred across 17 of 18 industry sectors. Machinery manufacturers said tariffs had increased prices for steel and other materials. They reported that ""a lot of suppliers are asking for increases, and the team is battling those requests.""
President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March. However, on Tuesday he postponed imposition of the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the EU until June 1 and reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil.
Miscellaneous products manufacturers described the tariffs as ""very concerning"" and said ""business planning is at a standstill until they are resolved."" Manufacturers of fabricated metal products said the steel tariffs had made it difficult to source material, ""and we have had to eliminate two products due to availability and cost of raw material.""
""Tariffs could add downside risks to factory production and increase input costs in the months ahead,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The ISM's measure of factory employment dropped in April. Transport equipment manufacturers said while business was robust, capacity constraints were a headache. They described labor as remaining ""tight and getting tighter."" 
Those sentiments were also shared by food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers who said shortages of trucks and drivers had impacted delivery times.
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING TUMBLES
Despite the second straight monthly drop in the ISM index, manufacturing remains underpinned by a firming global economy as well as a weakening U.S. dollar, which is boosting the competitiveness of American-made goods on the global market.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried about inflation. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries slipped. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in March as a sharp decline in homebuilding and renovations led to the biggest drop in investment in private construction projects in more than seven years.
Construction spending tumbled 1.7 percent. February data was revised to show construction spending increasing 1.0 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending accelerating 0.5 percent in March. Construction spending rose 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.
In March, spending on private construction projects declined 2.1 percent. That was the largest fall since January 2011 and followed a 1.2 percent increase in February. 
Outlays on private residential projects plunged 3.5 percent, the biggest drop since April 2009, after advancing 1.2 percent in February. Spending on both single and multifamily housing projects fell in March. Spending on home renovation dropped 8.0 percent last month.
Economists expected the construction data would subtract one-tenth of a percentage point from the government's 2.3 percent annualized growth rate estimate for first-quarter gross domestic product, which was published last Friday.

""We expect residential construction spending to grow in 2018 on our thesis that while home building is being constrained by supply issues, the demographic demand for housing units exceeds supply,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing growth slid to a 17-month low in April, sending sterling sinking and further reducing the chances of an interest rate hike by the Bank of England next week.
The pound fell below $1.37 for the first time in 3-1/2 months after Tuesday's Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped a full point to 53.9 in March, below the average forecast of 54.8 in a Reuters poll of economists.
It is the second disappointing data point in the space of a few days after official figures on Friday showed Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of 2018, with heavy snow only partly to blame.
Separate figures from the BoE showed consumers borrowing slowed sharply in March, in line with earlier data showing a big fall in retail sales that month.
""All in all, Markit's manufacturing survey provides more evidence that the economy has fundamentally slowed this year, strengthening the case even more for the MPC to hold back from raising interest rates later this month,"" Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Even before Friday's weak growth figures, BoE Governor Mark Carney had said economic data had been mixed and suggested the BoE might wait rather than raise rates to a new post-financial-crisis high of 0.75 percent on May 10.
There was nothing in Tuesday's PMI report to suggest British factories - which account for around a tenth of overall economic output - will regain the vigor they enjoyed in late 2017, when a recovery in the euro zone boosted British manufacturing.
Gauges of new orders and exports weakened to the lowest levels since mid-2017, while manufacturers took on staff at the slowest pace since February last year.
IHS Markit said weakness centered especially around producers of consumer goods who have been hit by the reduced spending power among households caused by last year's rise in inflation.
The Bank of England data on Tuesday added to signs of a lacklustre consumer economy, as Britons borrowed only a net 254 million pounds ($347 million) in March - far weaker than the Reuters poll forecast for growth of 1.45 billion pounds.
The year-on-year growth rate in unsecured consumer lending tumbled to 8.6 percent, its slowest since November 2015, down from 9.4 percent in February.
The drop in the annual growth rate was the sharpest from one month to the next since August 2009. On a three-month on three-month basis, which gives a clearer idea of the short-term trend, lending growth slowed at the fastest pace since 2000 to an annualized rate of 6.3 percent.
""With real incomes barely rising, such a sharp fall in consumer credit does not bode well for either the high street or the overall growth outlook,"" ING economist James Smith said.
IHS Markit said optimism among manufacturers dipped to a five-month low in April as concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate remained widespread.
The PMI's gauge of factory cost pressures cooled to a nine-month low, something that will be noted by BoE rate-setters who are keeping an eye on inflation pressures ahead of next week's policy decision.
Separate PMIs for the construction industry and the much larger services sector are due on Wednesday and Thursday.

Research firm Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.9 in last month, compared to forecasts for a reading of 56.5.
The prior month’s reading was revised down to 54.9.
Growth of output and new orders eased, while business optimism dipped to a five-month low. Falling backlogs of work, supply-chain constraints and rising stocks of finished goods also signaled that output growth will remain subdued in the coming months.
April also saw growth of new export business slow to a ten-month low.
“The start of the second quarter saw the UK manufacturing sector lose further steam. The headline PMI dipped to a 17-month low as growth of production, new business and employment all slowed"", said Rob Dobson, director at survey compiler Markit.
“While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates at historic lows on Tuesday, predicting inflation would remain muted even as the economy gained speed this year in a clear sign a hike was still a distant prospect.
In a decision that surprised no one, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept benchmark rates at 1.5 percent for a 21st successive month, the longest spell of inactivity since 1990.
Some analysts had thought it might rein in its optimism on the economy given a soft ending to last year. Instead, the central bank stood by forecasts that growth would ""average a bit above 3 percent in 2018 and 2019.""
Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth had slowed to 2.4 percent in the December quarter as bad weather dampened activity and offset strength in consumer and government spending.
""The Bank's central forecast for the Australian economy remains for growth to pick up,"" said RBA Governor Philip Lowe after the bank's May policy meeting.
Business conditions were positive, business and public investment spending were on the rise and export growth was expected to accelerate, Lowe said.
The central bank will formerly update its forecasts in a quarterly statement due out on Friday.
Lowe also stuck with his refrain that any rise in inflation would only be gradual, wrongfooting some analysts who had thought the RBA would nudge up its forecasts.
While the official measure of consumer prices was subdued in the first quarter at an annual pace of 1.9 percent, there was a slight uptick in underlying inflation.
There was new evidence of emerging price pressures in surveys of manufacturing out on Tuesday. While firms reported strong sales, orders and employment they also complained of rising input prices and a lack of spare capacity.
""Our concerns about capacity pressures remain. These pressures are helping support labour demand, but inflation risks are rising as well,"" said CBA chief economist, Michael Blythe.
""The indications of a modest turnaround in the recent CPI data appear to be continuing into Q2,"" he added.
RATE ROAD BLOCKED BY DEBT MOUNTAIN 
Lowe has long cautioned that the next move in rates is more likely to be up than down, but so far has emphasised that the central bank's board saw no strong case for a hike anytime soon.
Investors <0#YIB:> are wagering there is just a one-in-five chance of a hike by December and a move to 1.75 percent is not fully priced in until July next year. [AU/INT]
Arguing for patience on tightening is a A$1.7 trillion mountain of mortgage debt held by households, already burdened by near-record growth in wages.
Policy makers have made it abundantly clear they recognise that higher rates will hurt many households more than in the past, particularly now that home prices are turning lower.
Figures out from property consultant CoreLogic said on Tuesday prices for the combined capital cities slipped 0.4 percent in March, the seventh straight month of decline.
That left prices down 0.3 percent for the year, the first negative reading since late 2012 and a definitive end to a five-year boom in values.
Regulators began the cool down with tighter rules on lending, but recently banks have also been raising borrowing requirements amid revelations of widespread malpractices on loans and financial advice.
""The weakness in prices, with more to go, is consistent with our view that the RBA will leave rates on hold out to 2020,"" said AMP chief economist Shane Oliver. 

""The weakness is now at levels where the RBA started cutting rates in 2008 and 2011.""

SEOUL(Reuters) - South Korean exports declined in April for the first time in 18 months, unable to keep up with 2017's brisk pace as global demand softened, adding to worries about the country's trade outlook amid the risk of a deepening U.S-China trade conflict.
Exports fell 1.5 percent to $50.1 billion from a year earlier, marking the first decline since October 2016 when shipments fell 3.2 percent, government data showed on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 4.1 percent growth.
Imports increased 14.5 percent to $43.4 billion, less than the 18.4 percent growth economists had projected but handily beating the revised 5.2 percent expansion seen in March.
That resulted in a trade surplus of $6.6 billion, slightly below $6.8 billion the previous month.
""Exports slipped but there is no need to see this as a hard landing in shipments due to a sharp downturn in global demand, because shipments still exceeded $50 billion in value, just like in March,"" said Lee Sang-jae, chief economist, Eugene Investment and Securities.
Lee said exports were affected by a high base of comparison, as April 2017 saw bumper growth of 23.8 percent from the delivery of expensive vessels.
South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and home to the some of the world's leading suppliers of smartphones, displays, cars and ships, is the first major exporting nation to publish April trade figures.
Tuesday's trade ministry data suggested growth could slow from the brisk pace seen in 2017 as the trade-reliant economy faces weaker global demand for its computer chips, cars and ships.
The Trump administration's stiff tariffs on some exports from major trading partners could trigger counter-measures from many countries including China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, and escalate global trade tensions.
""There is still the risk of a trade war between the U.S. and China, which will affect global demand and hurt South Korean exports,"" said Lim Hye-youn, an economist at Daishin Financial Group. Lim expects South Korea to post export annual growth of 7 percent to 9 percent this year.
April exports to the United States declined 1.8 percent on-year, falling for a third straight month as South Korean cars and smartphones faced weaker demand there, the South Korean trade ministry said.
Exports to the European Union dropped 21.2 percent, while shipments to Vietnam fell 17.6 percent from a year earlier.
Still, April exports to China soared 23 percent and marked 18 consecutive months of expansion, thanks to strong demand for Korean memory chips, petrochemical products and machines. 
South Korea's economy expanded 1.1 percent in January-March from the previous quarter, supported by exports of data memory chips and a boost from government spending, after contracting 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter.

However, growth in new export orders slowed sharply due to a stronger yen, posing an additional risk for Japan's export-intensive manufacturing sector even as global trade tensions heat up.
The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis versus a flash reading of 53.3 and a final 53.1 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 20th consecutive month and rose for the first time in three months.
""April data pointed to a renewed acceleration in Japanese manufacturing sector growth,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""However, the new export orders index sub-component fell noticeably, albeit still remaining in expansionary territory, to signal only a marginal pace of growth.""
The final index for total new orders was 53.8, more than a preliminary 53.5 and a final 53.1 in the previous month, but growth in export orders slowed sharply to only marginal levels.
The yen  has risen around 3 percent versus the dollar since the start of the year, and some economists have expressed concern that Japan's exports could weaken if the yen rises further because this pushes up export prices.
Japan's economy is forecast to have expanded an annualized 0.5 percent in the first quarter as consumer spending and factory output weakened, according to a Reuters poll. That would be a marked slowdown from 1.6 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter. The data will be released on May 16.
The world's third-largest economy has grown for eight straight quarters through the end of 2017, the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy.

Some economists are worried that growth could remain sluggish due to a large increase in inventories in the semiconductor and electronic parts sector.

The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its pending home sales index nudged higher to a reading of 107.6, up 0.4 percent from February and the second consecutive monthly rise. January's index was slightly downwardly revised to 107.2.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales increasing 1.0 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the state of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
The housing market has regained some steam over the past couple of months after faltering at the turn of the year. 
The sector has been bolstered by a strong economy with unemployment at a 17-year low but the continuing rise in house prices, exacerbated by a shortage of supply, has in particular left many first-time buyers unable to afford a property.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 3.0 percent. 
In March, contracts in the Northeast plunged 5.6 percent from the prior month and they fell 1.1 percent in the West. In the Midwest, they rose 2.4 percent, and in the South they gained 2.5 percent.
Only in the South were pending home sales higher than a year earlier.

Latin America's second biggest economy grew by some 1.1 percent in seasonally adjusted terms compared with the previous three-month period, the estimate from the national statistics agency showed.
That was an acceleration from the fourth quarter of last year, when the economy grew by 0.8 percent on the quarter, according to final data published on Feb. 23.
Compared to the same quarter a year earlier, the economy grew by 1.2 percent in unadjusted terms, the agency said.
Final data for the first quarter will be published on May 23, the agency said.
A breakdown of the seasonally adjusted data showed the industrial sector grew by 0.7 percent in the first quarter compared with the October-December period, while agriculture advanced 0.8 percent and services expanded by 1.2 percent.
Mexico's economy faced challenging conditions in 2017, and uncertainty continues to swirl around the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which underpins the bulk of the country's exports.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to dump NAFTA if it cannot be renegotiated to his liking and ministers are due to meet for more talks on updating accord next week. Mexico also holds a presidential election in July.

Mexican inflation ended last year at a 16 1/2-year high, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates to 7.5 percent in February. However, inflation has begun to ease in 2018, giving some relief to consumers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices accelerated in the year to March, with a measure of underlying inflation surging to near the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target as weak readings from last year dropped out of the calculation.
The rise in the annual inflation gauges reported by the Commerce Department on Monday was anticipated by economists and Fed officials and is not expected to alter the U.S. central bank's gradual pace of interest rate increases. 
Annual inflation readings in March of last year were held down by large declines in the price of cell phone service plans, and decelerated through much of 2017.
""The Fed has been talking about today's inflation increase since last March,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""There is no reason to think the Fed will accelerate the pace of rate hikes as a result.""
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index jumped 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis last month. That was the biggest gain since February 2017 and followed a 1.7 percent rise in February. The PCE price index was unchanged on a monthly basis largely because of cheaper gasoline after advancing 0.2 percent in February.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index soared 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March, also the biggest increase since February 2017, after increasing 1.6 percent in February. 
The so-called core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent on a month-on-month basis in March after a similar gain in February. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. Last month's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Minutes of the Fed's March 20–21 policy meeting published this month showed officials expected the annual PCE price indexes to accelerate in March partly because of ""the arithmetic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation.""
The minutes also noted that the rise in inflation emanating from the so-called base effects ""by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path"" for the central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate. 
Fed officials are scheduled to convene on Tuesday and Wednesday for a regular policy meeting. The Fed raised rates last month and forecast at least two more rate hikes for 2018.
The dollar rose to near a three-month high against the euro on Monday on the back of weaker-than-expected German data. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose marginally while U.S. stocks were mixed.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
Economists expect the core PCE price index to hit 2.0 percent in May because of favorable base effects. Inflation is also rising as the labor market tightens. The government reported last Friday that wages and salaries recorded their biggest increase in 11 years in the first quarter.
In addition, regional factory surveys have shown increases in prices paid and received by manufacturers. Inflation is also likely to be fanned by an anticipated pickup in economic growth, driven by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending.
""We think that will convince the Fed to raise rates a total of four times this year, with the next hike coming in June,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The Commerce Department's report on Monday also showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent in March after being unchanged in February. 
The data was included in last Friday's advance first-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 2.3 percent annualized rate during that period.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in March. The so-called real consumer spending fell 0.2 percent in February. The rebound in real consumer spending last month supports expectations that consumption was held back by temporary factors in the January-March period and will gain momentum in the second quarter.
Personal income rose 0.3 percent in March after increasing by the same margin in February. With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $460.6 billion last month from $483.1 billion in February. 
Manufacturing data on Monday also offered an upbeat assessment of the economy. The MNI Chicago Business Barometer rose 0.2 points to a reading of 57.6 in April, ending three straight monthly declines. 
Factory activity in Texas accelerated sharply in April, with the Dallas Fed Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey's production index surging 11 points to a reading of 25.3.

But the housing market continues to be hobbled by an inventory squeeze that is restraining sales growth. The National Association of Realtors said contracts to buy previously owned homes rose 0.4 percent in March, slowing from February's 2.8 percent increase.

Lending to non-financial corporations picked up to 3.3 percent in March from an upwardly revised 3.2 percent a month earlier while household lending growth increase to 3.0 percent from 2.9 percent, the ECB said in a regular monthly statement.
Buying around 2.5 trillion euro worth of debt in the past three years, the ECB has labored away to depress borrowing costs and kick start lending, all in the hope of rekindling growth and inflation.
While its efforts have mostly paid off, growth has appeared to soften in recent months, raising concerns that the ECB could struggle to remove stimulus and may need to provide support for the economy longer than markets now expect. 
Lending also remains well below its pre-crisis mark, indicating that the bank sector is still far from healthy. Weighed down by bad debt often a decades old, many lenders remain reluctant to lend to the real economy while they struggle to repair their balance sheets.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, seen by some as a precursor of economic activity, slowed sharply to 3.7 percent in March from 4.2 percent a month earlier, trailing expectations for 4.1 percent.

The official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 51.4 in April, compared to 51.5 in March and the general consensus of 51.3.
The figure is still well above the 50-point mark that suggests expanding business conditions in China, although the softer numbers hinted a loss of momentum in the country’s economy following recent trade disputes with the U.S.
""The support to the economy from the easing of pollution controls should now largely have run its course,"" said Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics in a note to clients.
""Slower growth is likely in the months ahead as the drags on economic activity from weaker credit growth and the cooling property market intensify,"" Chang added.
Meanwhile, the official services PMI rose to 54.8 in April from 54.6 in March, the China’s National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement, calling the progress “a steady development.”
The composite PMI that covers both manufacturing and services activities came in at 54.1 in April, versus March's 54, according to the statement, adding that new export orders edged down to 50.7 from 51.3, but remained in line with readings over the past several months.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 12:24AM ET</span>","China official factory PMI eases slightly in April, export orders slow","BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's vast manufacturing sector eased only slightly in April in a sign of broad economic resilience, though slowing export orders pointed to risks to the outlook amid a simmering Sino-U.S. trade row. 
Beijing is in the third year of a broad effort to curb a dangerous build up of debt across the economy, and so far policy makers appear to have successfully steered through the challenge of tempering financial risks without imperiling growth. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.4 in April, from 51.5 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday, but remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. It marked the 21st straight month of expanding business conditions in China.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the index would ease slightly to 51.3. 
But the slightly softer reading, especially the slower export orders, adds to concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world's second-largest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and a heated trade row with the United States.
""The support to the economy from the easing of pollution controls should now largely have run its course,"" said Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics in a note to clients.
""Slower growth is likely in the months ahead as the drags on economic activity from weaker credit growth and the cooling property market intensify.""
Signs of softness in the trade sector were already evident in the latest PMI, with the export orders sub-index falling to 50.7 from 51.3. Total new orders also eased slightly, though the sub-index for output remained steady.
There are worries that the tech sector, which burnished China's solid exports growth in 2017, could come under pressure as the rising tensions between China and the United States threaten to hit billions of dollars in cross-border trade.
The hi-tech manufacturing sub-index, however, pushed up this month to 53.8, compared with 53.2 in March.
""Hi-tech manufacturing continues to lead,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with NBS, in a separate comment.
SLOWDOWN SIGNS
Economists expect China's economic growth to ease to 6.5 percent this year, inline with Beijing's target but below a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown on the country's finance sector and the growing trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China’s manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year, but signs of stress have started to emerge in softer industrial demand, slower investment growth, and a subdued property market. Producer prices have also weakened in the past several months [L3N1S23AA]
Speculation is also growing that Beijing is considering shifting its monetary policy to a looser bias, as the threat of an all-out trade war with the United States clouds the outlook for key growth drivers of both China's ""old economy"" heavy industries and ""new economy"" tech firms.
Nomura analysts saw no immediate need to boost stimulus.
""The still solid PMI suggests to us that there is no urgent need to move towards a more expansionary fiscal or monetary policy, and that the focus should remain on a gradual and orderly deleveraging to reduce financial risks,"" the analysts wrote in a note to clients.
The services industry showed ""steady development"", NBS said. The official services PMI rose to 54.8 from 54.6 in March, extending a solid run of activity.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more
spending power.
The composite PMI covering both manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.1 in April, from March's 54, well above the
50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.
The raw materials sub-index declined slightly, with the purchasing price of major raw materials also falling from March. At the same time, the ex-factory price index rebounded to 50.2, from 51.5 in the previous month.
The reduction in the difference between the product ex-factory price index and the purchase price index of major raw materials will ""benefit the improvement of corporate profits,"" Zhao said.
Activity in the construction sector, a major driver of growth in 2017, was almost steady with only a very modest pullback seen this month, the PMI survey showed.

The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index was revised up from a preliminary reading of 98.8 to 97.8.
Economists had forecast a reading of 98.0.
A sub index tracking consumer expectations rose from 86.8 to 88.4, beating forecasts for a smaller increase to 86.9.
A separate gauge tracking current conditions slipped from 115.0 to 114.9. Analysts had expected no change.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months was unchanged at 2.7%, while the five-year inflation expectations increased to 2.5%, from the prior 2.4%.
The survey center’s chief economist Richard Curtin noted that consumer sentiment improved slightly in the 2nd half of the month, shrinking the small overall decline for April.
“The final April figure was nearly identical to its 2018 average (98.9) -which was higher than any other yearly average since 107.6 was recorded in 2000 (which was, in turn, the highest yearly average in more than a half century),” Curtin said.
He also indicated that tax reform and trade policies continue to spark spontaneous, or unaided, comments.
“The spontaneous comments about the tax reform legislation had a positive balance of opinion, but the trade tariffs generated a negative balance of opinion,” Curtin remarked.
“Aside from the offsetting impact of Trump’s tax and tariff policies, the best simple summary of the current state of consumer confidence is that the economy is ‘as good as it gets’,” he said.
Curtin further noted that consumers and economists were somewhat apprehensive about future trends.
“Overall, the data are consistent with a growth rate of 2.7% in real personal consumption in the year ahead,” he concluded."
178,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>","U.S. economy slows in first quarter, but wage growth accelerates","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter as consumer spending grew at its weakest pace in nearly five years, but a surge in wages amid tightening labor market conditions and lower tax rates suggested the setback is likely temporary.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.3 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said in its snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Friday, also restrained by a moderation in business spending on equipment and investment in homebuilding.
These factors were partially offset by a rise in inventories and a narrowing of the trade deficit. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Domestic demand increased at a 1.7 percent rate, the slowest in two years, after rising at a brisk 4.8 percent pace in the final three months of 2017. 
The moderate first-quarter growth is, however, probably not a true reflection of the economy's health as GDP tends to be sluggish at the start of the year because of a seasonal quirk.
Economists expect growth will accelerate in the second quarter as more households feel the impact of the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax package on their paychecks. The tax cuts came into effect in January. 
Lower corporate and individual tax rates as well as increased government spending will likely lift annual economic growth close to the administration's 3 percent target. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast output rising at a 2.0 percent rate in the January-March period.
""Tax cuts and government spending increases should lead to better overall economic activity,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Federal Reserve officials are likely to shrug off the first-quarter performance. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates last month in a nod to the strong labor market and economy, and forecast at least two more rate hikes this year. 
Minutes of the March 20-21 meeting published earlier this month showed policymakers ""expected that the first-quarter softness would be transitory,"" citing ""residual seasonality in the data, and more generally to strong economic fundamentals.""
But a jump in wage growth and an acceleration in inflation in the first quarter will attract attention when Fed officials meet next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
In a separate report in Friday, the Labor Department said wages and salaries shot up 0.9 percent in the first quarter. That was the largest increase since the first quarter of 2007 and followed a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter. 
Wages and salaries were up 2.7 percent in the 12 months through March compared to 2.5 percent in the year to December. 
The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.5 percent rate - the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2007. The core PCE price index rose at a 1.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent inflation target.
""It is increasingly difficult to argue that the 2 percent inflation target hasn't already been breached,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""Could the Fed go next week? Not likely, but there are no rules preventing it. A more hawkish statement is coming.""
The dollar initially rose against a basket of currencies after the data, but gave up gains to trade little changed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were marginally higher while stocks on Wall Street fell.
WEAK CONSUMER SPENDING
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked to a 1.1 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013 and followed the fourth quarter's robust 4.0 percent growth rate.
Consumer spending in the last quarter was undercut by a decline in purchases of motor vehicles, clothing and footwear as well as a slowdown in food and beverages outlays. This likely reflects delayed tax refunds. In addition, surveys suggested many workers did not see the tax cut boost to their paychecks until late in the quarter. 
Income at the disposal of households increased at a 3.4 percent rate in the first quarter, accelerating from the fourth quarter's 1.1 percent pace. Households also boosted savings, which bodes well for a pickup in spending.
Business spending on equipment slowed to a 4.7 percent rate in the January-March quarter after double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. The cooling in equipment investment comes as the stimulus from a recovery in commodity prices is fading.
Investment in homebuilding was unchanged in the first three months of the year as sluggish home sales caused by a dearth of houses on the market weighed on brokers' commissions. Residential investment increased at a 12.8 percent rate in the October-December period. 
Government spending grew at a 1.2 percent rate, slowing from the fourth quarter's 3.0 percent pace. Spending is expected to accelerate in the second quarter after the U.S. Congress recently approved more government spending.
Trade added 0.20 percentage point to GDP growth as weak a U.S. dollar and strengthening global economy bolstered exports. 

With consumer spending slowing, inventories increased at a $33.1 billion rate in the first quarter, up from a $15.6 billion pace in the prior period. Inventory investment contributed 0.43 percentage point to GDP growth after subtracting 0.53 percentage point in the fourth quarter.

Gross domestic product grew by 2.3%, the Commerce Department said in its advanced estimate.
That topped economists’ forecasts for growth of 2.0% and was down from 2.9% in the previous quarter.
The slowdown was largely based on the drop in real consumer spending to 1.1% in the first quarter, from the prior 4.0%. That reading also mixed expectations for a 1.2% gain.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","UK economy slows sharply, investors cut bets on May rate hike","By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first three months of 2018, with heavy snow only partly to blame, prompting investors to slash their bets on a Bank of England rate rise next month.
Britain's economy grew at its weakest pace since the end of 2012, expanding by just 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018, at the bottom end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll and well below the BoE's prediction of 0.3 percent.
Sterling plunged by around three quarters of a cent against the U.S. dollar  and interest rate futures halved the odds on a May rate rise to less than a quarter from around 50 percent before the data .
""It clearly calls into question the prospect of a May rate hike,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Peter Dixon said.
The slowdown from modest growth of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 was driven by the biggest fall in construction output since the second quarter of 2012. 
But the Office for National Statistics said on Friday that bad weather was not wholly to blame, with much of the fall in construction taking place in January.
""While the snow had some impact, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
Rare snow storms and sub-zero temperatures in late February and early March, dubbed ""the Beast from the East"", were already known to have hurt some businesses.
The scale of the slowdown may unsettle the BoE, which next week will start meetings to consider whether to raise interest rates on May 10 for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis.
While the central bank had expected some impact from the bad weather, the figures suggest that a year of high inflation, and uncertainty about Britain's prospects once it leaves the European Union in March 2019, are taking a bigger toll on firms and consumer spending than expected.
Some central bank policymakers, however, have said early estimates of first-quarter GDP are often subject to upward revision, particularly at times of harsh weather.
Commerzbank's Dixon said the ONS did not have a great record of assessing the effect of weather on early estimates of GDP.
""If I were on the Monetary Policy Committee, I would say it's not a great number but it's not necessarily a reason not to hike rates,"" he said. ""This is not 2009 and we don't need 2009 levels of rates.""
At the start of April, economists had been pretty sure that the BoE would look past any weak first-quarter data because inflation has been running above its target and the unemployment rate is the lowest since 1975. 
But in the run-up to Friday's data, many were beginning to think the BoE could be getting cold feet about a May rate rise, after Governor Mark Carney alluded to ""mixed"" data last week and the possibility of moving rates at a later meeting.
In year-on-year terms, the pace of growth slowed to 1.2 percent, its weakest since the second quarter of 2012 and at the bottom end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
In the final three months of 2017, Britain recorded the slowest year-on-year growth of any major advanced economy. For this year, the International Monetary Fund predicts Britain will move ahead of Japan and Italy in the rankings.
Britain's preliminary GDP data rely heavily on estimates by ONS staff and only contain about 40 percent of the data in the final estimate.

Official data last week had already shown a big fall in retail sales in March, and earlier on Friday housebuilders reported a sharp drop in new housing starts in the first three months of 2018.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in the first three months of the year, below forecasts for growth of 0.3%.
That was the weakest reading since the fourth quarter of 2012 and marked a severe slowdown from growth of 0.4% in the final three months of 2017.
Year-over-year, UK economic growth expanded 1.2% in the first quarter, missing expectations for a repeat of the prior quarter’s 1.4% gain.
Additionally, the index of services in the U.K. rose 0.4%. That missed expectations for a repeat of the fourth quarter’s 0.6% advance.
The ONS noted that snow had some impact on economy, especially in construction and some areas of retail, but remarked that the overall effect on GDP was limited.

Asia's economic powerhouse has led a synchronized uptick in global growth over the past year and a half, led by solid exports and a booming construction sector, though Chinese policy makers have had to walk a tight rope between defusing financial risks and keeping output broadly stable. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is seen down at 51.3 in April from 51.5 in March, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. 
Rising tensions between China and the United States threaten to hit billions of dollars in cross-border trade. Analysts say these risks seem to have encouraged some Chinese exporters to ship out goods in early 2018, helping bump up China's export numbers for January-February. 
Exports are expected to have rebounded in April from a weak March outcome, as shipments normalized thanks to still-solid global demand. [nL3N1RU1Z6] 
""We expect April economic indicators to have improved from March, particularly in exports where we are very likely to see a reversal of March's negative growth,"" said Lisheng Wang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura. 
Risks to growth, however, have risen in the wake of the U.S.-China trade dispute. While analysts say it is too early to gauge the potential fallout of the tariff standoff with the United States, a dent to business confidence could impinge on economic momentum. 
Indeed, while the economy has displayed remarkable resilience in 2017 and early this year, signs of stress have shown up in softer industrial demand, slower investment growth, and a subdued property market. This is backed up by expectations that weaker producer prices will have persisted in April in line with a broader cooling in output.[L3N1S23AA][nL3N1S23AA]
Economists expect growth in the world's second-largest economy to ease to 6.5 percent this year, from 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown on the country's finance sector and the Sino-U.S. trade row seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed. [nL3N1RU2FP]
Separately, a private survey on China's factory activity for April is forecast to show a similar easing trend as the official reading.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 04:45AM ET</span>",French first-quarter growth slowdown tests ECB optimism,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - French economic growth slowed slightly more than expected at the start of the year, official data showed on Friday, a day after the European Central Bank played down concerns of softness in the broader euro zone economy.
The INSEE statistics agency said in a first estimate that the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months - the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016.
That marked a slowdown from 0.7 percent growth recorded in the final three months of last year and was slightly below economists' average forecast for 0.4 percent in a Reuters poll.
Slower business investment and exports in the face of a stronger euro were the main drags on the economy in the first quarter, a breakdown of the data showed.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the growth slowdown came as no surprise after the exceptionally strong end to 2017.
""I think growth is solid in Europe and sustainable but we all know their are some clouds on the horizon,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting with EU counterparts in Bulgaria, citing the risk of a trade war and interest rate increases.
The European Central Bank sought to calm concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy on Thursday with sources telling Reuters policymakers were keen not to upset investors' expectations that its stimulus program would end this year.
French inflation data offered ECB central bankers some relief on Friday, showing consumer prices rose the most in five and a half years in April to 1.8 percent, just below the ECB's 2.0 percent target. 
Weak inflation had been the main justification for the ECB's 2.55 trillion-euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus program.
SOFT PATCH
Capital Economics economist Jessica Hinds said that the slowdown was likely to prove a blip, forecasting the French economy would grow 2.3 percent this year and next after expanding 2.0 percent in 2017.
""Granted, the activity surveys have softened since the start of the year. But they are still consistent with quarterly GDP growth of about 0.6 percent,"" Hinds said in a research note.
""And investment is set to grow at a decent pace thanks to President (Emmanuel) Macron’s pro-business approach. Meanwhile, the continued improvement in the French labor market points to solid growth in consumer spending,"" she added.
Consumer spending growth, traditionally the main motor of the French economy, grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter despite exceptionally cold temperatures boosting energy consumption in February.
Meanwhile businesses slowed investment growth to 0.5 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous three months while overall production of goods and services slowed to only 0.3 percent from 0.9 percent.
Manufacturing production fell particularly sharply, down 1.1 percent as companies such as carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and pharmaceutical group Sanofi (PA:SASY) said the euro's strength had hit their sales.
As a result, exports swung from a sharp increase in the fourth quarter to a slight decrease in the first three months of 2018. Since imports were flat, foreign trade had no impact on overall growth, INSEE said.

Pork prices in Tokyo fell in April from a year earlier, and that subtracted 0.04 percentage point from inflation, one of the biggest causes of a weaker-than-expected price rise. China imposed extra 25 percent tariffs on U.S. pork in response to the U.S. tariffs, and that caused more meat to come into Japan, according to a statistics bureau official.
The trade dispute is another factor that’s undercutting the Bank of Japan’s efforts to generate sustained inflation. Any increase in U.S.-China trade tensions puts that effort at risk, as it could damage the economic recovery and cause other goods to flow to Japan, depressing prices.
Consumer prices in Tokyo, excluding fresh food, rose 0.6 percent in April, decelerating for a second month. Phone prices and hotel costs also subtracted from the rise. Wholesale prices of pork carcasses in Tokyo were down 7.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Agriculture & Livestock Industries Corp.

Shipments of core capital goods declined 0.7 percent last month after a downwardly revised 1.0 percent increase in February. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have surged 1.4 percent in February. Business spending on equipment likely slowed in the first quarter after double-digit growth in the second half of 2017.
But against the backdrop of a sharply lower corporate income tax rate, economists expect a marginal impact on business spending on equipment from rising interest rates and more expensive raw materials, which could squeeze profit margins for manufacturers.
The Trump administration slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective in January.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) CAT.N on Tuesday reported strong financial results for its first quarter and upgraded its profit outlook for the full year. The world's largest heavy equipment maker, however, cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased costs of materials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell in March, weighed down by the biggest decline in demand for machinery in nearly two years, and a drop in shipments cemented expectations that business spending on equipment slowed in the first quarter.
But other data on Thursday showed the economy remains on a strong footing. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in more than 48 years last week and the goods trade deficit narrowed sharply in March amid strong export growth.
""The U.S. economy is still moving higher,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The pullback in goods orders from companies is not a red flag for the economic outlook yet even if the caution light should be left on.""
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.1 percent last month.

They were previously reported to have vaulted 1.4 percent in February. Business spending on equipment likely cooled in the first quarter after double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. The moderation in equipment investment is expected to have combined with a sharp slowdown in consumer spending to restrain economic growth in the first quarter.
U.S. Treasury yields held at lower levels after the data. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as strong earnings from Facebook (O:FB) and a handful of chipmakers powered technology shares. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely slowed to a 2.0 percent annualized rate in the first three months of the year. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP on Friday.
FISCAL STIMULUS
The anticipated slowdown in economic growth is likely to be temporary against the backdrop of a robust labor market that is expected to underpin consumer spending. The economy is also expected to get a boost from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package as well as increased government spending, which should also support business investment.
""We still expect investment growth to pick up over the rest of the year, as tax cuts boost domestic demand and capacity constrains bite,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended April 21, the lowest level since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 230,000 in the latest week. 
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not far from the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
""The tight labor market keeps getting tighter,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""Companies are extremely reluctant to release labor, presumably because of the difficulty in replacing workers.""
A third report from the Commerce Department showed the goods trade deficit fell 10.3 percent to $68.0 billion in March. Exports rose $3.4 billion to $140.1 billion last month, reflecting a strengthening global economy and weak U.S. dollar. Imports fell $4.4 billion to $208.1 billion in March.

The department also reported that wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent last month. Retail inventories, however, fell 0.4 percent. The goods trade deficit and inventory data had a marginal impact on first-quarter GDP estimates.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia needs a national dialogue to end a deadlock over economic reforms in the same way it solved a political crisis in 2013 that almost tore apart the birthplace of the Arab spring, the head of the co-ruling Islamist party said.
Since an uprising that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia has a new constitution, free elections and a coalition government with secular and Islamist parties in a region otherwise struggling with upheaval.
But the North African country has been grappling with an economic crisis and youth unemployment of about 30 percent as turmoil has deterred investors, surviving at the mercy of foreign donors.
Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Ennahda party in power with secular forces, said Tunisia needed a dialogue on a technocratic level to tackle reforms such as trimming its bloated public sector, a key demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
""Now it's the decisive time for major reforms,"" Ghannouchi told Reuters in an interview. ""We need an economic consensus like we had a political one to make the revolution a success.""
Many normal Tunisians say that while they enjoy the most liberal political system in the region, they are materially worse off than before 2011, with annual inflation hitting a record level of 7.6 percent in January.
Protests broke out in January this year across the country with young people complaining they cannot get jobs.
Seven prime ministers have failed since 2011 to cut down the public services and loss-making state firms as unions or other groups have blocked reforms.
""There is a dialogue between parties and organizations to find a consensus for economic issues but this cannot go on forever,"" Ghannoushi said. ""There is no alternative to experts sitting down and agreeing on details of the reform solutions.""
Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet made up of unions and civic groups won in 2015 the Nobel Peace prize for mediating between secular forces and Ennahda, which had won the first elections since 2011.
Political assassinations and protests of secular Tunisians against Islamists had escalated until a consensus was reached on a constitution enshrining women's and democratic rights.
Exiled during the time of Ben Ali, Ghannouchi has been a major force in the post-revolution transformation.
The 76-year-old remains a dominant figure who critics say effectively controls the country in tandem with the secular-minded President Beji Caid Essebsi, 91, dubbed the ""two sheikhs"" in reference to their age.

Ghannouchi said his party preferred stability to push through reforms instead of changing the prime minister again. When asked about the performance of the government he said: ""Not worse than the previous ones.""

The ECB kept rates at record lows and confirmed that quantitative easing bond purchases would continue at 30 billion euros ($36.5 billion) a month until at least end-September or until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.
With the euro zone economy expanding for 20 straight quarters, policymakers are now debating how and when to curb stimulus further, hoping that a rapid, jobs-rich expansion will eventually lift inflation back to its near 2 percent target.
But recent weaker-than-expected economic data and anemic inflation readings this year suggest the bank will take an incremental approach to removing stimulus, raising the risk it will err on the side of caution and withdraw support too slowly.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,"" the ECB added, repeating its long-standing guidance on rates.
Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT news conference, at which he is likely to discuss the economic soft patch, worries over trade protectionism and the potential impact of higher oil prices.
With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at -0.40 percent.
The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25 percent.

ECB officials, including President Mario Draghi, have indicated that the bank will move only cautiously towards winding up its asset purchase program, which is currently slated to end in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported slower-than-expected sales growth in the first part of April, industry figures showed on Thursday, raising the possibility that a big decline in March was due to more than just severe weather.
The Confederation of British Industry said its April sales volume balance rose to -2 from March's five-month low of -8, below the average forecast of +5 in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""Sales have continued to disappoint in April after falling in March. But expectations for next month are looking a little healthier,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Retailers expect the sales balance to rebound to +25 next month - though this forward-looking measure had failed to anticipate the weakness seen in March and April.
Clothing and furniture stores have done worst this month, with grocers and DIY stores are doing better, the CBI said.
Several major British retailers have faced financial trouble in recent months, as consumers tightened their purse-strings in response to higher inflation following 2016's Brexit vote.
""Much of this reflects ongoing structural changes in the sector as well as the continued squeeze on households' real incomes,"" Leach said. ""While conditions have improved for households recently ... we expect further gains in living standards to remain modest.""
The Bank of England has forecast that quarterly economic growth data due on Friday will slow to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, in large part due to snow storms dubbed ""the Beast from the East"".
But if the economy fails to rebound rapidly, that raises the prospect of underlying weakness, reducing the likelihood that the BoE will raise interest rates next month, as financial markets had previously expected.
""Following (BoE Governor) Mark Carney's recent dovish comments, the CBI survey will likely fuel suspicion that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates at the May MPC meeting,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at consultants EY ITEM Club.
April factory orders data from the CBI, released on Tuesday, were also weaker than expected but relatively solid by historic standards.
Data on mortgage approvals and car manufacturing, released earlier on Thursday, painted a subdued picture for March. Businesses did, however, report offering more generous pay settlements than before.

The CBI data were collected from 52 retail chains from March 28 to April 13.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy bounced back last quarter, buoyed by booming exports of data memory chips and a boost from government spending, although private consumption was sluggish.
Thursday's Bank of Korea GDP report showed the economy expanded 1.1 percent in the first quarter, rebounding after contracting by 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter and beating the 1.0 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. 
Export volumes, particularly for memory chips and other IT products, gained 4.4 percent and added to growth.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), South Korea's world-leading tech exporter, posted a record quarterly profit of 11.6 trillion South Korean won ($10.75 billion) on Thursday thanks to booming sales of semiconductors used in servers.
The chip boom has offset soft domestic demand and the blow to tourism from diplomatic tensions with China over South Korea's installation of a U.S. THAAD missile defense system. 
Private consumption, which accounts for about half of GDP, marked its slowest growth in a year, gaining a mere 0.6 percent from the previous quarter. 
The service sector grew 0.9 percent on-quarter, but output of food and lodging services declined 0.9 percent even as South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang in February-March.
""The food and lodging sector is still suffering from fewer Chinese tourists as part of the THAAD backlash,"" said Chung Kyu-il, a director general at the Bank of Korea. 
""People also went out less due to the cold wave and fine dust issues,"" Chung said. 
Chung said 4.1 percent growth in service sector output from 'cultural activities' reflects a boost from the Winter Olympics, reversing the service sector's 1.8 percent fall in the fourth quarter.
In annual terms, GDP rose 2.8 percent in the first quarter, on par with a 2.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
Government spending rose 2.5 percent and posted the fastest quarterly gain in six years, thanks to higher spending on health care. 
""The expanded medical benefits boosted government spending, while surging shipments of memory chips are still supporting exports,"" a Bank of Korea official said.
Park Chong-hoon, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank of Korea, says domestic demand will recover in the second half.
""Exports will continue to lead growth. An increase in the minimum wage will kick in slowly and we could probably see household spending picking up in the second half,"" Park said. 
Even with 17 months of uninterrupted export growth through March, policymakers are navigating the competing concerns of weak domestic consumption and household debt at about 190 percent of disposable income. 
With youth unemployment still hovering near record levels at 11.6 percent, scarce jobs and the consequent downward pressure on wages have held back domestic demand. 
A 3.9 trillion won ($3.62 billion) government bill proposed to support firms that hire young workers has yet to be approved by the National Assembly. 
The central bank expects the economy to expand 3 percent this year, but that estimate is subject to global demand for South Korean memory chips and other manufactured goods in the face of a feared trade war between the United States and China and its potential fallout.

France's economy has been showing signs of strength, with unemployment falling and the public deficit coming in below the European Union's three percent limit for the first time in a decade last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April and new home sales increased more than expected in March, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite signs that growth slowed in the first quarter.
Other data on Tuesday also showed house prices increasing solidly in February. Strong consumer confidence and rising house prices should underpin consumer spending, which appears to have braked sharply at the start of the year.
""Americans appear to think the economy is headed in the right direction and it's not just all talk because their greater confidence is leading them to buy more new homes,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""Everywhere you look confidence seems to be a rising tide that will lift all the boats.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 128.7 this month from a downwardly revised 127.0 in March. The index was previously reported at 127.7 in March. Confidence raced to more than a 17-year high of 130.0 in February.
Consumers' short-term expectations also improved in April, with the share of those expecting their incomes to decline over the coming months reaching its lowest level since December 2000. But the survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 22.9 from 23.8 in March.
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. The jobless rate has been stuck at 4.1 percent for six straight months.
The economy added 103,000 jobs in March, the fewest in six month. Though economists shrugged off the modest job gains as payback after February's outsized increase in hiring, they also acknowledged that employment growth was slowing.
""We have now seen two straight months of weakening in the labor market differential since the high for the cycle to date that was reached in February,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Several other labor market indicators have also cooled off over the past month or so.""
Consumer confidence has remained strong despite stock market volatility, which was in part triggered by fears of a trade war between the United States and China, as well as geopolitical worries. In April, confidence was high among households with an annual income below $25,000 and those in the $75,000-$125,000 bracket. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Stocks on Wall Street reversed earlier gains as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note breached 3 percent for the first time in more than four years. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were mostly trading lower while the dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies.
STRONG HOUSING DATA
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales increased 4.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units last month as sales in the West surged to their highest level in more than 11 months.
Adding to the report's strength, February's sales pace was revised up to 667,000 units from the previously reported 618,000 units. Data for January was also revised to show sales unchanged instead of declining 4.7 percent. 
New home sales, which account for 11 percent of housing market sales, jumped 8.8 percent from a year ago.
While the bullish new home sales report did little to change economists' expectations that residential investment fell in the first quarter, it supported the view that an anticipated economic growth slowdown during that period would be temporary. 
Gross domestic product estimates for the January-March quarter are below a 2 percent annualized rate, largely reflecting weak consumer spending.
First-quarter GDP also tends to be soft because of a seasonal quirk. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Friday. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 6.8 percent in the 12 months to February after rising 6.4 percent in January. House prices are being driven by an acute shortage of properties available for sale.
""Rising prices are a mixed bag for the housing market,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com. ""While homeowners benefit from extra equity, potential buyers can get discouraged as the dream of homeownership becomes more elusive."" 
Strong house price inflation was also corroborated by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that showed its house price index rising a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in February after a 0.9 percent increase in January.

Home prices advanced 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis in February.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence increased to 128.7, compared to a reading of 126.0 forecast by economists. The measure had decreased to 127.0 in the previous month.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The Present Situation Index increased from 158.1 to 159.6, while the Expectations Index improved from 106.2 last month to 108.1 this month.
“Consumer confidence increased moderately in April after a decline in March,” Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
Franco noted that consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved somewhat, with consumers rating both business and labor market conditions quite favorably.
She further indicated that consumers’ short-term expectations also improved, with the percent of consumers expecting their incomes to decline over the coming months reaching its lowest level since December 2000 (6%).
“Overall, confidence levels remain strong and suggest that the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace in the months ahead,” Franco concluded."

203,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>","Weak business morale from Germany, France, Italy points to slowdown","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Business morale in Germany, France and Italy -- the euro zone's three biggest economies -- deteriorated in April as a stronger currency and capacity constraints limited output, signaling that growth in the currency bloc has reached its peak.
The euro zone was unexpectedly one of the best performers among major economies last year. But surveys suggest that growth has steadily slowed since January on euro strength and fears of a trade war between China and the United States.
German business confidence fell for a fifth consecutive month in April to reach the lowest level in more than a year, the Ifo institute said on Tuesday, suggesting that Europe's biggest economy is losing some steam.
""High spirits among German businesses have evaporated,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. ""The German economy is slowing down.""
The Munich-based Ifo institute said its new business climate index, which for the first time incorporated responses from the services sector, fell to 102.1 from 103.3 in March.
This was the lowest reading since March 2017 and came in weaker than a Reuters poll of analysts who had pointed to a less pronounced drop to 102.7.
Separate data from France's national statistics body on Tuesday showed that industrial morale in the euro zone's second-biggest economy dropped to 109 points in April, down from a revised figure of 110 points for March.
""There's definitely a slowdown, and the euro is not helping,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, fund manager at Geneva-based firm Clairinvest.
""The European Central Bank is stuck in a corner. If they look to normalize rates, the euro will just shoot up and they're finding it hard to successfully talk down the euro.""
In Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, morale among businesses also fell amid political stalemate in the wake of inconclusive national elections seven weeks ago.
The surveys contradicted IHS Markit's composite flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone, which was released on Monday and showed private sector growth held steady in April.
Oliver Rakau from Oxford Economics said the national surveys put the expected bounce-back of GDP growth in the second quarter into question after a soft patch at the start of the year.
""Combined with risks to the export outlook from rising trade tensions, the euro zone economy looks to be clearly past its growth peak,"" Rakau added.
CAPACITY LIMITS
Business morale in German manufacturing deteriorated for the third consecutive month but nevertheless remained at a high level, according to the Ifo survey, which is now based on the responses of some 9,000 firms.
""Companies are reaching capacity limits. Many firms cannot hike production and work through their orders because there's a shortage of staff,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
In the service sector, the business climate index fell sharply as managers were far less optimistic about the next six months.
On the upside, business morale in construction hit a new record high as firms benefit from increased demand for real estate due to a growing population, record-low borrowing costs, rising real wages and a solid labor market.
The Ifo figures pointed to German gross domestic product growth of 0.4 percent in the first quarter, Wohlrabe said, adding: ""The fifth drop in a row is a sign of normalization. We are far from a recession.""
The Finance Ministry cautioned on Friday that growth could slow slightly in the first quarter after an expansion of 0.6 percent on the quarter in the final three months of 2017.
The International Monetary Fund last week raised its forecast for German economic growth, predicting a healthy 2.5 percent expansion this year.

The German government will update its own growth forecast on Wednesday after leading economic institutes on Thursday projected 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.0 percent next.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>","Australia inflation stays soft in first quarter, interest rates seen going nowhere","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices stayed soft last quarter as core inflation began a third year below the central bank's target, cementing expectations any hike in interest rates is a long distance off.
The local dollar  hovered near four-month lows as the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4 percent in the March quarter, missing forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase.
Annual CPI inflation ran at 1.9 percent, again under estimates. Key measures of underlying inflation favored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) averaged around 1.9 percent for the year, much as forecast.
Core inflation has now undershot the RBA's long-term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent for nine straight quarters, the longest period on record.
A major headwind has been wages growth, which slowed to historic lows even as employment boomed, an unwelcome phenomenon shared with much of the developed world.
As a result, the central bank has kept interest rates at an all-time low of 1.5 percent since mid-2016 and sees no strong case for shifting anytime soon.
There is ""no particular rush"" to hike, RBA Assistant Governor Christopher Kent said earlier on Tuesday. While the next change in interest rate was likely to be up, he said progress on inflation and unemployment was expected to be only gradual.
Interest rate futures <0#YIB:> imply around a 30 percent chance of a move by December, with 1.75 percent not fully priced in until June next year.
Kent was speaking at a housing conference where he refuted media speculation that the expiry of A$480 billion in interest-only mortgages over the next few years would be akin to the sub-prime crisis in the United States.
PRICE WARS 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported continued disinflation in tradable prices - those that face the most international competition - which fell 0.4 percent in the quarter to be down 0.5 percent on the year.
In contrast, prices of non-tradables which mainly cover services climbed 0.8 percent in the quarter and 3.1 percent for the year.
The main price increases in the March quarter were for education, gas, vegetables, health care and drugs.
Many sector and regulated prices - from transport charges to school fees - tend to rise at the start of the year. Yet even adjusting for those seasonal effects, CPI inflation was still 1.9 percent for the year to March.
The largest price declines came for holidays, tech equipment, furniture and clothing. Clothing alone dropped 2 percent in the quarter due to ""competition and discounting activity in the retail industry"", the ABS said.
A fierce price war has broken out in Australian retail in recent years driven by an influx of foreign chains, with no sign of a cease-fire any time soon.

The struggle is only heating up as online behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched late last year vowing to beat all the competition - a disinflationary trend that policymakers now refer to as the ""Amazon effect"".

208,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales increase strongly; inventory remains tight,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased for a second straight month in March amid a rebound in activity in the Northeast and Midwest regions, but a dearth of houses on the market and higher prices remain headwinds as the spring selling season kicks off.
The supply squeeze is expected to ease somewhat later this year as data last week showed the stock of housing under construction rising in March to levels last seen in July 2007.
""Existing home sales look okay today with some clouds further out on the horizon from rising home prices and mortgage rates not enough to make us worry yet about the outlook this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that existing home sales rose 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.60 million units last month. The market for previously owned homes accounts for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales. Sales fell 1.2 percent year-on-year in March. 
Sales surged in the Northeast and Midwest, after being weighed down by bad weather in February, but fell in the South and the West.
There is an acute shortage of homes, especially at the lower end of the market. According to the NAR, sales of houses priced below $100,000 dropped 21 percent in March from a year ago.
The resulting higher house prices and rising mortgage rates are a constraint for first-time buyers, who have been largely priced out of the market. First-time home buyers accounted for 30 percent of transactions last month, up from 29 percent in February, but down from 32 percent year ago.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.47 percent, the highest level since January 2014. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and expansionary fiscal policy. 
The U.S. central bank forecast at least two more rate hikes this year, a sign that mortgage rates could rise further.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher, outperforming a marginally firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. government bonds fell.
RISING HOUSE PRICES
While the number of previously owned homes on the market rose 5.7 percent to 1.67 million units in March, housing inventory was down 7.2 percent from a year ago. Supply has declined for 34 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 30 days in March, down from 37 days in February and 34 days a year ago. 
At March's sales pace, it would take 3.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.4 months in February. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $250,400 in March. That was the 73rd consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
""This speaks a lot to sound fundamentals of strong demand and a good economy, but it's not at all clear how long this pattern of lackluster sales volumes but consistently rising prices can realistically be expected to continue,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. 
The NAR said it expected housing inventory to start rising on an annual basis in late summer. Government data last week showed the inventory of housing under construction rose 0.3 percent to 1.125 million in March, the highest level since July 2007. Single-family units under construction climbed 0.2 percent to the highest level since June 2008.
Despite last month's increase in home resales, economists believe residential investment fell in the first quarter. That is expected to have combined with a sharp slowdown in consumer spending to undercut economic growth in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product estimates for the January-March quarter are below a 2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government is scheduled to publish its advance first-quarter GDP estimate on Friday.
With both business and consumer confidence at high levels, the anticipated slowdown in first-quarter economic growth is likely temporary and in part reflects a seasonal quirk.
A survey on Monday from data firm IHS Markit showed strong manufacturing and services business activity in early April, driven by robust growth in new orders and rising prices.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index rose to a reading of 54.8 this month from 54.2 in March, indicating a faster upturn in business activity across the private sector.

Existing home sales rose 1.1% in March from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.60 million units.
Economists had forecasts a 0.2% increase to an annualized pace of 5.55 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.
The report indicated that while existing-home sales grew for the second consecutive month in March, lagging inventory levels and affordability constraints kept sales activity below year ago levels.
""Robust gains last month in the Northeast and Midwest – a reversal from the weather-impacted declines seen in February – helped overall sales activity rise to its strongest pace since last November at 5.72 million,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun commented.
""The unwelcoming news is that while the healthy economy is generating sustained interest in buying a home this spring, sales are lagging year ago levels because supply is woefully low and home prices keep climbing above what some would-be buyers can afford,"" he added.
The median existing-home price for all housing types in March was $250,400, up 5.8% from March 2017 ($236,600). Last month's price increase marks the 73rd straight month of year-over-year gains.
“Although the strong job market and recent tax cuts are boosting the incomes of many households, speedy price growth is squeezing overall affordability in several markets – especially those out West,” Yun concluded."

“After a relatively disappointing start to the year, the second quarter should prove a lot more encouraging,” this expert indicated.
Williamson said that the survey data pointed to growth of 2.5% in the second quarter.
He highlighted that growth in new orders accelerated to show the largest surge in demand for goods and services for just over three years while companies’ expectations for growth also jumped to a three-year high.
Williamson also noted that hiring remained robust, pointing to the creation of around 200,000 nonfarm payrolls in April.
“The details of the survey therefore suggest that output growth is on course to accelerate as we move into the summer,” Williamson concluded.
However, he also warned that prices are meanwhile being pulled upwards by the strength of the upturn, “sending hawkish signals for policy makers”."

However, a private survey also showed export orders fell for the first time in more than a year and a half as a gradual appreciation in the yen starts to erode Japan's export competitiveness.
The flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.3 in April from a final 53.1 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 20th consecutive month and rose for the first time in three months.
""Although new export orders declined for the first time since August 2016, as the stronger yen begins to impact price competitiveness, the rise in total new business inflows signals stronger domestic demand,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The index for total new orders rose to a preliminary 53.5 from a final 53.1 in the previous month, but export orders shrank marginally, the contraction in external demand since August 2016.
The yen  has risen around 4 percent versus the dollar since the start of the year, and some economists have expressed concern that Japan's exports could weaken if the yen rises further because this pushes up export prices.
Japan's economy is forecast to have expanded an annualized 0.5 percent in the first quarter as consumer spending and factory output weakened, according to a Reuters poll. That would be a marked slowdown from 1.6 percent annualised growth in the fourth quarter.
The world's third-largest economy has grown for eight straight quarters through the end of 2017, the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy.
Most economists believe weakness in the first quarter will be temporary, but the value of the yen and any increase in trade frictions with the United States pose risks to the outlook.

The survey also showed Japanese firms continued to face sharp rises in input costs, but were able to pass on some of the increases to their customers.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Pricey U.S. home sales soar as buyers ignore new tax code,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A housing shortage, strong economy and robust demand have pushed many homes in major U.S. cities over $1 million, offsetting buyers' concerns about the reduced benefits of owning a pricey property under President Donald Trump's tax reform, data show.
Home sales at $750,000 and above have surged by double digits annually in the past three years, closings data from realtor.com show for 30 counties on the east and west coasts.
Sales below $750,000 are down in the past two years due to a scarcity of homes priced around $500,000 and below and the lower end’s larger market size has pulled down overall sales, the data show. While the Trump tax plan affects homes for sale above $750,000, the fact that overall sales fell suggests the new tax law is not the main culprit for the decline.
The new law caps the deductibility of mortgage debt at $750,000 and annual property taxes at $10,000. This was expected to hurt home sales as fewer people would be able to utilize mortgage interest and property deductions when paying taxes. 
Overall sales in 30 counties with million-dollar homes that realtor.com examined fell 8.5 percent in December from a year ago and 7.0 percent year-over-year in January. 
But the number of homes sold above $750,000 actually grew in December and January, though they slowed to single-digit gains of 7.9 percent and 4.8 percent from a year earlier, respectively.
Ten counties accounted for three-fourths of the 4,268 sales in January above $1 million, while half or more homes sold in San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties in California and New York county, which is Manhattan, were above that mark.
""Our data suggests that in these high-priced markets there was enough momentum in demand and enough inventory toward the end of last year and the beginning of 2018 to power sales growth in the $750,000 plus segment,"" Javier Vivas, director of economic research at realtor.com, told Reuters.

The stock market boom and higher property values have helped propel the high end, said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.
""Those that can afford a $1 million-plus property have seen their net worth benefit from asset price inflation over the last several years,"" Price said. 
""This is a marked difference when compared to most working class Americans that primarily see their spending power and home affordability as a function of wage gains alone.""
The 30-county data from realtor.com represent 98 percent of final closings unlike the less comprehensive, but more timely, samplings often used to indicate real estate activity. The counties account for 10 percent of all home sales and 60 percent of sales above $1 million, but just 1 percent of U.S. counties. 
The new tax code created a pause among home-buyers in December and is much discussed, said Paul Breunich, president and chief executive of William Pitt-Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty in Stamford, Connecticut.
""It's definitely having some effect but consumer confidence and the economy are overriding the tax costs,"" Breunich said.
An overall sales decline in the 30 counties in December and January prompted an outcry from realtors about the tax reform's perceived impact.
The falloff was in line with declining nationwide home sales during those two months, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), and sales rebounded in February, it said. 
Preliminary realtor.com data for the 30 counties still show an overall, though slower, decline in February. But sales rose at the high end that month too, highlighting the supply constraint at the low end and strong demand for pricier homes.
The variance is due to an accelerating decline in sales below $750,000 in the 30 counties and the shrinking size of that segment, which was almost three times larger than sales above that threshold in 2014. By last year it was less than double the size of the higher end where sales are still rising.
TAX LAW TAKES BACK SEAT FOR NOW
The supply-demand imbalance is proving to be less acute at the higher price points and the overall pool of buyers in this segment remains large, Vivas said. 
""While many that were on the fence of buying a million dollar home many have had to reassess their move,"" Vivas said. ""For many this year the purchase decision will be driven by finding the right home more than the new tax code.""
Most buyers see around $1 million as a ""sweet spot"" because if $200,000 is put down on a purchase there's still a tax break on a mortgage up to $750,000.
""That is how most buyers are viewing it,"" said Judi Desiderio, chief executive of Town & Country Real Estate in East Hampton, New York, adding accountants are very busy fielding calls from their clients.
Sales have not been uniform, even within the same region. Manhattan had the sharpest overall sales slump from a year ago in January but the biggest gain was nearby Nassau county on Long Island. Both were 27 percent - one negative, the other positive.
NAR in January estimated home prices would likely slide this year by 6.2 percent in New Jersey and 4.8 percent in New York, the biggest declines by state, due to the tax reform.
New York had the highest average deduction of state and local taxes in 2014 at $21,000 per tax payer, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, followed by Connecticut and New Jersey.
But the high-end remains hot and is a seller's market. Never before have there been more eyes on fewer homes, Vivas has said.
A sampling of nationwide U.S. housing data for March show the median listing price was up 8 percent from a year ago, surpassing the 2017 high, and the inventory of available homes for sale was down 8 percent year-over-year, realtor.com said.

If the pattern holds, one in 12 U.S. listings will be above $1 million this summer, a jump from the one in 40 homes listed at that price in February, Vivas said, citing NAR data.

Singapore's consumer price index is expected to have risen 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the poll of 10 economists showed, unchanged from February. 
""Headline and core CPI are expected to continue rising in March, supported by an uptick in services inflation and higher oil prices,"" said Maybank Kim Eng Securities economist Lee Ju Ye. 
The poll's median for the annual increase in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) core inflation measure in March was 1.7 percent, also steady from the month before. 
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation, which are influenced more by government policies.

MAS tightened policy for the first time in six years at its semiannual meeting last week. The central bank said that core inflation should come in within the upper half of its forecast range of 1-2 percent in 2018, while headline all-items inflation is projected to be in the upper half of the 0-1 percent range for the whole of 2018.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's headline inflation slowed in March from February, highlighting the central bank's struggle to hit its 2 percent price growth target after five years of heavy stimulus, keeping it under pressure to maintain an ultra-easy monetary policy. 
The core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.9 percent year-on-year in March, matching economists' median estimate, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data showed on Friday.
It followed a 1.0 percent gain in February.
Analysts expect core consumer inflation to peak later this year as upward price pressure from energy and food is likely to moderate, and will raise more hurdles in the Bank of Japan's path to exiting easy monetary policy.
""We expect inflation excluding fresh food to average 1 percent in the current fiscal year, below the median forecast among BOJ board members of 1.4 percent,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. 
""If we are right, the bank will have to reduce its inflation forecasts yet again over the coming months, underlining that policy tightening is a long way off.""
Sources familiar with the central bank's thinking said it is likely to maintain the view that inflation will reach its 2 percent target next fiscal year, and will stay near that level the following year, when it issues new forecasts next week.
Those projections could increase the prospects of the BOJ deciding to debate whittling down its massive stimulus next fiscal year.
But a complete shift to monetary tightening is unlikely as BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said inflation must exceed a stable 2 percent before the bank can trim its huge holdings of government bonds and exchange-traded funds. 
Friday's data showed the so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes fresh food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.5 percent in the year to March - flat from the previous month.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, expanded at an annualized 1.6 percent in October-December, posting its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy, on the back of solid capital spending.
Japan's unemployment rate hovers near a 25-year low at 2.5 percent, which should encourage inflation by putting upward pressure on wages.

However, consumer prices have risen more slowly than the BOJ had hoped, as companies hold off on raising prices and wages, citing uncertainty over the economic outlook.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Japan's manufacturers' mood sours as yen, oil prices rise: Reuters Tankan","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers worsened for a third straight month in April to a level unseen since early last year, the Reuters Tankan poll showed on Friday, as rises in the yen and crude oil prices threaten to undermine corporate profits.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found manufacturers' confidence was expected to improve a little over the next three months, although fears of a global trade war cloud the outlook.
Trade tensions, such as the United States and China's recent dueling tariff announcements, could hit Japan's export-reliant economy hard, potentially leading to financial market turmoil that would cause an unwelcome spike in the safe-haven yen.
The specter of a trade war adds to concern about global political risk, including a potentially spreading of conflict in the Middle East and renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, which have pushed up crude oil and commodity prices.
In the Reuters poll of 542 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 253 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about a profit squeeze caused by the strong yen and rising raw materials costs.
""The prices of our products are struggling to catch up with a further increase in crude oil prices,"" a manager of a chemicals maker wrote in the survey.
A manager of a metal products/machinery firm wrote: ""Our business conditions are not so good because our clients have no appetite for capital expenditure thanks to U.S. and other countries' economic policies, and geopolitical risks.""
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 21, down seven points from the previous month, dragged lower by industries such as oil refiners, makers of chemicals, and exporters of cars and electric machinery.
The survey conducted over April 4-17 found the index was expected to improve to 23 in July. 
The service-sector index rose to 36, up one point from March and matching a record high last seen in June 2015, led by retailers, suggesting a pick-up in private consumption that makes up about 60 percent of the economy.
The index is expected to fall slightly to 35 in July.
The Reuters Tankan followed the central bank's key tankan survey that showed big manufacturers' sentiment worsened for the first time in two years as worries about a rising yen and trade frictions with the United States dimmed the outlook.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended April 14, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 230,000 in the latest week. 
The economy created 103,000 jobs in March, the fewest in six months. Economists largely dismissed the slowdown as payback after strong gains in February. They also blamed cooler temperatures for the moderation in hiring.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not far from the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday indicated that businesses remain upbeat about the economy, with tight labor markets and strong borrowing seen as a sign that economic growth is likely to continue. 
The document, a compendium of opinions about the economy gathered from business contacts throughout the Fed's 12 regional districts, highlighted growing labor shortages across high-skilled occupations and in the construction and transportation sectors. 
The Fed raised interest rates last month and forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday that the claims data for Maine and Colorado were estimated, while claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after being devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 1,250 to 231,250 last week, from an unrevised 230,000 in the previous week.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 15,000 to 1.86 million in the week ended April 7. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 6,750 to 1.86 million.

The consensus forecast had been for a reading of 20.8.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers stayed home in March as they felt the chill from the 'Beast from the East', leading to the biggest quarterly fall in retail sales in a year and weighing on first-quarter economic growth, official figures showed on Thursday.
Unusually cold and snowy weather caused retail sales volumes to drop by 1.2 percent compared with the month before, the Office for National Statistics said, a bigger fall than most economists polled by Reuters had expected.
Looking at the quarter as whole, sales dropped by 0.5 percent compared with the final three months of 2017 - the biggest fall since Q1 2017. The ONS said this was likely to lop 0.03 percentage points off first-quarter GDP growth, which other analysts forecast at around 0.3 percent.
Sterling fell to a one-week low after the data, which caps a week where wages rose more slowly and inflation dropped quicker than expected, raising doubts about how far the Bank of England will raise interest rates this year.
However, few economists are willing to ditch their predictions that the BoE will increase rates next month for only the second time since the financial crisis, even if odds on a further rate rise this year have been lengthening.
""If the past is anything to go by, much of the spending lost during the bad weather will be made up at a later date. As such, we expect sales volumes to rebound in April,"" Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said.
The data may not cut much ice with the Bank of England, which last month said it expected the wintry weather to slow overall economic growth temporarily but not affect an underlying picture that pointed toward higher interest rates.
The BoE is likely to stick to its view that the labor market is primed for a pick-up in wages, as unemployment is at a 42-year low, leading to stronger consumer demand later this year as inflation continues to fall.
FUEL DOWN, ONLINE UP
The ONS said automotive fuel sales fell particularly sharply in March, but that department stores reported strong online demand, especially in the run-up to Mother's Day and Easter.
It said there was anecdotal evidence that food shoppers switched away from supermarkets to smaller local stores.
Britain's economy underperformed its rivals last year as higher inflation - caused by the fall in the pound since June 2016's Brexit vote - hurt the consumers' spending power, though forecasts for a sharp downturn proved too pessimistic.
Official data earlier this week showed British inflation fell to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent, its lowest in a year and below BoE forecasts.
The gauge of inflation used in the retail sales data, the retail price deflator, sank to its lowest since January 2017 at 1.9 percent in March.
The ONS said that retail sales in cash terms recorded their weakest annual growth since June 2016, expanding by just 3.0 percent. In volume terms, sales rose 1.1 percent, the ONS said, versus expectations of a 2.0 percent rise in a Reuters poll.
British retail chains - whose profits typically hinge on cash spending rather than volumes - have had a tough few months.

Earlier on Thursday department store  Debenhams  (L:DEB) warned about its full-year profit outlook for the second time in four months after its first-half profit more than halved. 
Major flooring retailer  Carpetright  (L:CPRC) said last week it would seek creditor approval for a restructuring plan to close nearly a quarter of its stores, and Toys R Us UK and electrical store Maplin closed their doors before.
But others such as online fashion retailer ASOS (L:ASOS) and discount clothing chain Primark (L:ABF) have done better.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A year-long wave of optimism over Brazil's long-term economic prospects may be fading as skepticism grows over the fate of structural reforms after this year's presidential elections, according to the latest Reuters poll of economists.
Poll respondents downgraded their forecast for 2019 economic growth for the first time since Reuters began collecting estimates for that year, in January 2017.
Latin America's largest economy is now expected to expand 2.7 percent in 2019, according to the median of 42 estimates taken April 9-16, compared to 2.8 percent in the previous survey.
Estimates varied between 1.5 percent and 4 percent, a wider range than in the January poll but consistent with previous surveys, suggesting a widespread decline in expectations.
Though the change is small, it breaks a remarkable stretch of upward revisions that suggested a growing conviction that Brazil would manage to sustainably grow at higher rates after emerging from its deepest recession in decades.
That perception seems to be changing after President Michel Temer failed to pass a bill streamlining the social security system that analysts and ratings agencies considered crucial to curbing growth of public debt.
""The longer it takes for policymakers to tackle difficult measures, such as pension reform, the harder it will be for a favorable equilibrium to emerge,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said. ""Not only is the speed of recovery at stake, but also where the economy will end up.""
Temer, whose approval rate has plummeted due to corruption scandals and an unpopular austerity platform, faced strong lawmaker opposition to the pension plan and gave up on it after a federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro state legally barred Congress from voting on constitutional amendments.
Now the burden of safeguarding a constitutionally mandated spending ceiling will fall on the winner of this year's presidential election, which is looking to be the most uncertain in decades.
A recent survey showed growing uncertainty among voters after former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was leading polls and had rallied against Temer's fiscal agenda, was arrested for accepting bribes.
The field is divided between several political outsiders and insiders, from former São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin and former Supreme Court Justice Joaquim Barbosa to law-and-order lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro and nationalist Ciro Gomes.
Whether the winner will favor deficit-cutting measures or gather enough support from Congress to implement them remains to be seen.
""A government with enough political capital to implement the needed fiscal measures can emerge from the presidential elections in October 2018, but the risks are not negligible,"" BBVA (MC:BBVA) economists wrote in a report.
The change in outlook is even more remarkable when confronted with the rest of Latin America, where forecasts for 2019 GDP growth for all four other major economies included in the poll remained flat.
In fact, Brazil is likely to underperform nearly all of them, with the sole exception being Mexico, which is expected to grow 2.3 percent after hosting its own presidential elections.
Still, economists upgraded their 2018 growth estimates for Mexico, a sign that dragged-out negotiations with the United States and Canada on trade are unlikely to have much effect on activity in the short-term.

The construction and manufacturing sector grew 6.3 percent from a year earlier, accelerating from a 5.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter, according to more detailed data released by the National Bureau of Statistics a day after quarterly GDP.
China's economy expanded 6.8 percent in January-March, beating expectations for a 6.7 percent gain, riding on the coat-tails of robust property investment and resilient consumer demand.
Manufacturing also rebounded early this year after authorities lifted winter pollution restrictions and as steel mills cranked up output as construction swung back into high gear.
But economists still expect China to lose momentum in coming quarters as Beijing forces local governments to pare back infrastructure projects to contain their debt, and as property sales cool further due to strict government controls on purchases to fight speculation.
More than 100 cities have introduced some measures to cool home prices. Still, analysts expect moderate price appreciation in China's vast number of smaller centers where regulations are less restrictive.
""We think the pick-up in industry and construction will prove short-lived as the temporary boost to factory activity from the easing of pollution controls fades and tighter restrictions on off-budget spending by local governments weigh on infrastructure investment,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
China's construction and manufacturing accounted for 39 percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, roughly in line with its 41 percent share in the previous quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on statistics bureau data. 
The services sector continued to be the biggest contributor to GDP, accounting for 57 percent of China's economic output in the first quarter. 
Services grew 7.5 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter, while agriculture expanded 3.2 percent in January-March, easing from the 4.4 pace in the previous three months. 
Real estate grew 4.9 percent in the first quarter, marginally faster than the 4.8 percent pace in the previous quarter. 
Accommodation and catering expanded 7.0 percent, little changed from 7.1 percent growth in October-December. 
The retail and wholesale sector slowed slightly to 6.8 percent growth from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter. 
The sector faces headwinds, with property sales and retail sales both vulnerable to a weakening labor market, slower credit growth and government controls on property purchases, Evans-Pritchard said. 

The tech sector sustained its double-digit growth in the first quarter, though its pace slowed slightly to 29.2 percent from 33.8 percent in October-December.

New-home prices across 70 cities gained 0.42 percent from a month earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Wednesday’s data from the National Bureau of Statistics. That compared with a 0.25 percent increase in February.
The biggest gains came in the smaller so-called third-tier cities, where buying restrictions are looser and a push by the government to redevelop slums is giving an extra boost to demand. Officials are trying to tame prices across the country without causing any excessive property slowdown. Prices rose 0.94 percent in those smaller cities.
The latest data add to mixed signs for the market after home sales grew at a weaker pace in March, according to a government release on Tuesday. China’s biggest developer by sales, Country Garden Holdings Co., this month said the firm’s turnover was “too slow,” threatening to fine or dismiss staff who missed targets for getting projects to market.
In the biggest cities, prices edged up an average of 0.1 percent, ending seven months of declines, according to Bloomberg calculations. Prices rose 0.2 percent in Shanghai and Guangzhou and 0.1 percent in Beijing, dipping 0.1 percent in Shenzhen.
Developers are contending with home purchase restrictions across at least 125 cities, according to data provider Fang Holdings Ltd. The island of Hainan -- known as China’s Hawaii and the site of a planned free-trade zone -- was among the latest places to expand curbs.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 11:33PM ET</span>","China's new home prices edge up, gains extend to larger cities","By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices rose for their 35th consecutive month in March, with more cities reporting growth as the government supported demand from first-time buyers and despite persistent curbs to dampen speculative demand.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.4 percent in March from the previous month, up from 0.2 percent growth in February, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data published on Wednesday.
On a yearly basis, new home prices increased 4.9 percent in March, slowing from February's 5.2 percent increase, partly due to a high base effect as policymakers rushed to impose a flurry of fresh tightening measures in late March last year.
For graphic on China's property market click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/CHINA-ECONOMY-HOMEPRICES/0100611021Y/index.html
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes. Fifty-five cities reported higher prices in March, up from February's 44.
""Today's data shows there is still significant upwards price pressure,"" Yan Yujin, an analyst with Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute said. ""It is possible some cities will release more tightening measures.""
China's property market has soared since 2016, giving a major boost to the economy but also raising concerns about bubbles. Prices have slowly leveled off and even softened in tier-1 cities following government measures to rein in speculative investment.
While more than 100 cities have introduced some measures to cool home prices, analysts still expect moderate price appreciation in the country's vast number of smaller centers where regulations are less restrictive.
Price gains reported by smaller provincial capitals expanded by 0.3 percentage points in March from that in February. Haikou, a port city and the capital of China's island province Hainan, became the top price performer in March, rising 2.1 percent on-month.
Meanwhile, prices in top-tier cities also increased 0.1 percent in March from February, reversing a fall in the previous month, the NBS said in a statement along with the data.
Ouyang Jie, vice-president of Shanghai-listed Future Land (SS:601155), said developers have been rushing to roll out new projects in the hope of accelerating sales and securing funding, especially in smaller cities where inventories are falling rapidly.
""More high-end projects were released into the market in March as some were delayed by authorities in the beginning of the year when the National Congress was underway,"" said Joe Zhou, head of research for JLL China, a property services firm.
""Developers also have more pricing rights in smaller cities for now because they had a really good sales year in 2017 in those markets.""
But Zhou also warned of the risks of a moderate price correction later this year with demand frontloaded in smaller cities and signs of softening as more supply becomes available.
China posted its fastest property investment in three years in the first quarter, driven by a surge in land values and as developers grew more confident about the policy outlook.
New home prices on average for the country are expected to rise faster than previously thought in 2018 on falling inventories and still robust demand from smaller cities, according to a Reuters poll last month.
New household loans, mainly mortgages, totaled 580 billion yuan in March. They made up 52 percent of total new yuan loans, versus 33 percent in February.
Chinese property developers are reporting firm results so far. Last week, China's second-largest property developer Vanke (HK:1036) reported total contract sales of 154.26 billion yuan in the first quarter, up from 150.3 billion made in the same period last year.
Higher borrowing costs pose a risk for the sector as they will potentially dampen demand, although mortgage rates remain low compared with historic levels, analysts say.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Lowest jobless rate since 1975 fails to spur UK wage growth,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British workers' pay is still rising by less than inflation despite the lowest unemployment rate since 1975, official data showed on Tuesday, but weaker-than-expected wage growth is unlikely to stop interest rates rising next month.
Since February, Britain's central bank has homed in on what it sees as an increasingly tight labor market that risks keeping inflation above target, unless interest rates go up faster than it thought at the start of the year.
Tuesday's data showed average weekly earnings in the three months to February were 2.8 percent higher than a year earlier - unchanged from January's rate, a two-and-a-half-year high, but below economists' forecasts of a pick-up to 3 percent.
Consumer price inflation was 2.9 percent over the period.
Sterling fell after the data, but few economists thought the figures would stop the majority of Bank of England rate-setters from voting for an increase in rates to 0.75 percent next month.
""A lot of the detail in the report suggests the labor market is still tightening,"" said Philip Shaw, an economist with Investec.
The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.2 percent, its lowest since the three months to May 1975, while the employment rate for working-age Britons rose to its highest since records began in 1971 at 75.4 percent.
The robust employment data contrast with a more subdued picture for the rest of the economy.
British households - whose spending is the main driver of the country's economy - have been hit by the double whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation, due mostly to the fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 Brexit vote. 
The International Monetary Fund lifted its growth forecast for Britain this year to 1.6 percent on Tuesday due to stronger overseas demand, but this is below Britain's historic growth rate and that expected for most advanced economies this year.
WAGE PUZZLE
Central banks in many rich nations have been puzzled by the failure of wages to rise more quickly as unemployment falls, something they link to factors ranging from increased use of technology by firms to growth in the number of insecure jobs. 
The BoE has been repeatedly wrong-footed in the past when predicting sustained improvements in wage growth.
Former BoE policymaker David Blanchflower and fellow academic David Bell said in a research paper earlier this month that British wages are unlikely to take off due to the still-large numbers of part-time workers who want to work longer hours.
The BoE forecast in February that wage growth would reach 3 percent by the end of the year, though since then some policymakers have said it could get there sooner, including Ian McCafferty in a Reuters interview last week.
Before the financial crisis, British wages typically rose by just over 4 percent a year.
Since then, largely stagnant productivity has played a big role in keeping pay growth low, though over the last couple of quarters it has started to pick up.
Finance minister Philip Hammond welcomed Tuesday's record employment figures and said they could help lift productivity.
While greater numbers of people in work do not automatically boost productivity, if hiring becomes harder businesses may try to squeeze more out of existing staff, for example by investing in labor-saving technology.
Within the labor market data, there are some signs that pay growth is gathering momentum.
The weakness in headline pay growth was due to a fall in bonus payments compared with a year earlier, which the ONS said could be due to month-to-month volatility.
Annual pay growth excluding bonuses picked up to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent, its highest since the three months to August 2015, and April data should reflect an increase in the minimum wage and some public-sector salaries.
Based on the ONS's preferred CPIH measure of inflation, which takes more housing costs into account than the CPI used by the BoE and government, pay growth edged ahead of inflation for the first time in almost a year.
However, some analysts said annual gains reflected weakness in early 2017, and that private-sector pay growth compared with three months earlier had slowed to a 10-month low.

""This won't go unnoticed by the MPC, which since the summer has taken to citing this growth rate in its communications,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 10:26AM ET</span>","IMF, economic institutes raise their forecasts for German growth","By Rene Wagner and Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its forecast for German economic growth, predicting a healthy 2.5 percent expansion for Europe's biggest economy this year.
The forecast represents an increase of 0.2 percentage points from the IMF's January projection. For 2019, the IMF expects a calendar-adjusted growth rate of 2.0 percent.
The upbeat assessment by the Washington-based IMF follows a string of weaker-than-expected economic data and sentiment surveys that suggested a muted start to 2018.
Last year, the German economy grew 2.2 percent which translated into a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent. That was its strongest growth since 2011.
Germany's leading economic institutes are also planning to raise their growth forecast later this week, two sources familiar with the deliberations told Reuters on Tuesday.
The institutes expect the German economy to expand 2.2 percent this year, up from previous estimates of 2.0 percent, the sources said. For 2019, they foresee growth of 2.0 percent.
The German government, which relies on the institutes to calculate its own estimates, will update its growth forecast next week. The institutes will announce their revised growth figures on Thursday.
The German government said in January it expected the economy to expand by 2.4 percent this year.
The institutes had also initially estimated the economy would grow by 2.4 percent this year, the sources said. But they lowered that to 2.2 percent after weak economic data in the first quarter.
German industrial orders fell in January and rose by 0.3 percent in February amid weak domestic demand. Industrial output fell the most in more than two years in February, as industry lost some of its momentum in the face of the rising threat of protectionism.
Adding to signs that the economy was losing steam, exports fell unexpectedly in February, posting their biggest monthly drop in two years and narrowing Germany's trade surplus.
Despite the weak data, economists and the government expect the economy to rebound in the spring.

Buoyant tax revenues, a record budget surplus, falling unemployment and low borrowing costs have fueled a consumer-led upswing in Germany.

245,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 01:02AM ET</span>","China First Quarter GDP Grows 6.8%, Slightly Above Expectations ","Investing.com - China’s GDP growth figures for the first quarter of 2018 came in at 6.8% year-on-year, slightly above market expectation of 6.7%, official data showed on Tuesday. Strong consumer demand and surprisingly robust property investment were cited as supportive.
On a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter jumped 1.4%, compared with the revised growth of 1.6% in the October-December period, the National Bureau of Statistics said. Analysts had expected growth of 1.5%.
However, the country’s industrial production data came in worse than expected, posting 6.0% compared to the estimated 6.4% and the 7.2% for the January-February period. Meanwhile, retail sales beat expectations in March, rising 10.1% from a year ago as sales of cosmetics, clothing, furniture and home appliances rose during the period. The data is compared to the consensus forecast of 9.9%.
In other data, January to March fixed asset investment growth slowed to 7.5% from a year ago, down from 7.9% in the first two months of the year. Economists had previously expected fixed asset investment to come in at 7.6% over the first three months of 2018.
The slew of data came amid escalating tensions with the U.S. in recent months, its largest trading partner. 
Analysts at Nomura said the stable first-quarter growth “was supported mainly by the new economy components”, but added that “weaker March activity data support our view that there will be an economic slowdown ahead, driven by cooling investment growth, financing deleveraging, structural reforms which bring short-term pain, and rising trade protectionism.”"
246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",China Economic Growth Held Up by Consumption as Industry Eases,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic expansion held up amid robust consumer spending, underpinning global growth and giving authorities more room to purge excessive borrowing, while the industrial sector showed signs of modest slowdown.
Steady growth offers support for President Xi Jinping’s mission to shore up financial stability, one of Beijing’s top goals along with reducing poverty and curbing pollution. The robust pace of expansion is a tailwind for the global economy which is seen maintaining its solid performance this year, providing needed support in the form of strong demand for China’s exports.
“The picture is pretty robust,” Cui Li, head of macro research at CCB International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Consumption is very strong, so that’s in line with the rebalancing story.”
Retail is getting a lift from online sales, which rose 35.4 percent in the first quarter. Another driver of activity was investment in environmental protection and cleanup, which surged 34.2 percent on year in the first quarter, according to the statistics bureau.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang last week said economic indicators performed better than expected in the first quarter amid continued improvement in the global outlook.
Industrial output by the mining sector decreased 1.1 percent in March, compared with a 0.9 percent drop in December, while output for power supply increased 5.8 percent, less than the 8.2 percent increase in December.
“March data point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by old economy sectors,” said Rob Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. “We don’t expect growth in new economy sectors to fully offset the slowdown in the old, heavily-indebted sectors of the economy in the quarters ahead. This is a necessary adjustment to improve the quality of China’s growth.”
Headwinds may strengthen in coming months should Xi’s so-called critical battles against financial risk and pollution bite deeper or if trade tensions with the U.S. intensify. Property and infrastructure activity will weaken in the second half of this year, though manufacturing investment, solid consumption and strong external demand will cushion the impact, says UBS Group AG.
“This shows us that China can attain the growth target easily in 2018 even with slightly slower expansion in the second half,” said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It provides a good window to address some structural issues, especially deleveraging.”

248,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 06:28AM ET</span>",China posts strong growth despite trade concerns,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by strong consumer demand and robust property investment. 
Resilience in the world's second-largest economy will likely keep a synchronized global recovery on track for a while longer, even as China faces rising tensions with the United States that could impact billions of dollars in trade. 
But economists still expect China to lose momentum in coming quarters as Beijing forces local governments to scale back infrastructure projects to contain their debt, and as property sales cool further due to strict government controls on purchases to fight speculation. 
Consumption, which accounted for almost 80 percent of economic growth in the first quarter, played a significant role in supporting the economy even as risks grew for Chinese exporters.
March retail sales rose 10.1 percent from a year earlier, slightly more than expected and the strongest pace in four months, with consumers buying more of almost everything from cosmetics to furniture and home appliances.
""The retail sales data tells you a lot about consumption. It is not seasonal - if you look at growth in cosmetics, spending on clothing, spending on automobiles, there has been a persistent trend for a few months,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong. 
""Consumption is really strong, there is strong wage growth in urban areas. We underestimated the power of consumption in China.""
China's export sector also posted solid growth in the first quarter, with shipments to the U.S. jumping 14.8 percent on-year. Some analysts have speculated Chinese firms may have rushed out deliveries to the U.S. as tariff threats loomed.
However, net exports overall were a drag on GDP growth in the quarter after giving an added boost to the economy last year, highlighting the need for sustained strength in domestic demand if significant new tariffs are imposed. 
""We don't expect (the U.S.-China tensions) will evolve into a full-scale trade war, but we also argue this uncertainty will not disappear and we expect a bumpy road of negotiations. In terms of the impact of potential tariffs, it is pretty limited, particularly this year,"" said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JP Morgan in Hong Kong. 
""Even in the worst scenario that both countries start to implement the $50 billion tariffs, we're talking about a few tenths of a percentage point and most likely it will only start to affect the economy late this year and in 2019.""
CRACKDOWNS ON FINANCIAL RISKS, POLLUTION TO CONTINUE 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected January-March GDP to grow 6.7 percent from a year earlier, slowing marginally from the pace in late 2017.
China's GDP has now grown 6.8 percent for three straight quarters, a remarkably steady pace for such a large and dynamic economy and reinforcing concerns about the reliability of official data.
On a quarterly seasonally adjusted basis, GDP grew 1.4 percent, slightly less than expected and easing from 1.6 percent in October-December, again suggesting the economy may be losing some steam.
Still, growth remained comfortably above the government's target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, giving policymakers room to further reduce risks in China's financial system and rein in pollution without stalling economic growth. 
Authorities have repeated pledged to reduce a mountain of corporate debt in the name of national security, though they have moved cautiously to avoid stunting business activity. 
Beijing has also stuck to its campaign of shuttering heavily polluting factories as it tries to encourage more sustainable and higher quality growth from ""new economy"" sectors such as technology. 
Smokestack industries have been a key focus of that pivot in industrial policy, even though it is weighing on China's overall manufacturing outlook. 
Industrial output expanded 6.0 percent in March on-year, the slowest pace in seven months. Analysts had predicted output growth would cool to 6.2 percent from 7.2 percent in the first two months of the year. 
""Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech,"" said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore.
""The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors.""
REAL ESTATE TO SLOW
First-quarter readings on China's property sector, a key economic driver, were mixed but also appeared to reflect the growing influence of changing government policies.
Real estate investment accelerated to 10.4 percent in the quarter - the fastest pace in three years - compared with a 9.9 percent rise in the first two months of this year.
Analysts say a significant rise in land prices, as well as a government push to build more public housing, could have contributed to the unexpected strength in the headline figure and a jump in construction starts.
Property sales, however, continued to slow amid a flurry of government measures to get soaring home prices under control and rising mortgage rates. Sales by floor area rose 3.6 percent in the quarter, easing from earlier in the year.
Fixed-asset investment has also faltered as Beijing urges local governments to refrain from rampant borrowing to finance glamour projects to beat economic growth targets. 
January-March fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 7.5 percent, below expectations and 7.9 percent in January-February.
Infrastructure investment rose 13 percent on-year, easing slightly from January-February.
In one surprise shift, private investment - which accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China - grew faster than state firms' investment for the first time in over two years.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.9 percent in January-March, accelerating from an increase of 8.1 percent in the first two months.
""The pickup in private investment this year is mainly the result of improving corporate profits from last year and government policy support. Bank lending at the start of the year also helped,"" David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist at ANZ. 

Despite a more upbeat first quarter than expected, analysts still predict China's economic growth will slow to 6.5 percent this year, with the ongoing regulatory crackdown and U.S. trade dispute seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.[ECILT/CN]

249,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>","Australia inflation to stay low for some time, limit case for rate rise - RBA","SYDNEY, April 17 (Reuters) - - Australia's central bank saw scant reason to raise interest rates this month given inflation remained below target and likely to remain subdued in the face of sluggish wage growth.
Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) April meeting showed its Board agreed the next move in rates was more likely to be up than down, assuming the economy gathered momentum as expected.
Yet, the Board also saw ""no strong case"" for a move in the near term, even as it notched up the longest period without a change in modern history.
The last move was a cut to 1.5 percent in August 2016, and financial markets are wagering this steady spell could last well into 2019.
Crucially, wage growth and inflation has undershot expectations for some years and showed little sign of heating up soon.
""Low growth in labor costs in combination with strong competition in the retail sector suggested that inflation would remain low for some time,"" the minutes showed.
The bank had said exactly the same thing this time last year, underlining the lack of improvement.
There was also a note of caution in the Board's outlook, noting only that the economy ""looked likely"" to record faster growth in 2018 after a somewhat disappointing 2.4 percent outcome last year.
The labor market remained a bright spot with employment booming over the past year or so and leading indicators pointing to further gains ahead.
Yet unemployment had stayed stubbornly stuck around 5.5 percent and levels of underemployment were relatively high, a factor weighing on wage growth.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 12:49PM ET</span>",Automobiles power U.S. retail sales in March,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded in March after three straight monthly declines as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, suggesting consumer spending was heading into the second quarter with some momentum.
Economists saw a limited impact on retail sales for now from a recent ebb in consumer sentiment, citing a robust labor market, which is steadily pushing up wage growth. 
Consumer sentiment slipped in early April as households worried about the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy. Fears of a trade war between China and the United States have roiled financial markets.
""The trade war and battered stock market may yet cause the consumer to temper their consumption expenditures, but for the moment, the sun is out and shining,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Consumers are doing their part to drive the economy forward as they restart their engines from a cold and snowy winter."" 
The Commerce Department said on Monday retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month after an unrevised 0.1 percent dip in February. January data was revised to show sales falling 0.2 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent drop. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.4 percent in March. Retail sales in March increased 4.5 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in February. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have risen 0.1 percent in February. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors watched geopolitical developments. U.S. stocks rose on waning fears that the weekend's U.S.-led missile attack on Syria would escalate into a broader conflict. U.S. Treasury prices fell and dollar weakened against a basket of currencies.
SLOW FIRST-QUARTER SPENDING 
Last month's pick-up in core retail sales did little to change expectations of a sharp slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter. 
Economists largely blame the weakness in retail sales at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds. Some also argue that income tax cuts, which came into effect in January, only reflected on most workers' paychecks in late February. 
""The large swing in consumption between February and March is consistent with an important role for household after-tax incomes being restrained and then lifted by a unique pattern of tax refunds and withholdings,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""We believe those forces will remain supportive for consumption in the second quarter, and after today's number remain comfortable with prospects for a rebound in household outlays this quarter.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a robust 4.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. It is expected to have slowed to below a 1.5 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. 
Economic growth estimates for the January-March quarter are running below a 2 percent rate. The economy expanded at a 2.9 percent pace in the October-December quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate for first-quarter GDP growth later this month.
In March, auto sales jumped 2.0 percent, the largest increase since last September, after declining 1.3 percent in February. Sales at furniture stores climbed 0.7 percent while those at electronics and appliance stores increased 0.5 percent.
But sales at building material stores fell 0.6 percent last month and receipts at clothing stores dropped 0.8 percent. Sales at online retailers increased 0.8 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars gained 0.4 percent. Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores dropped 1.8 percent.
While the stock market volatility has not yet impacted on consumer spending, it is chipping away at business confidence.
In a separate report on Monday, the New York Federal Reserve said its Empire State index tumbled seven points to a reading of 15.8 in April. The survey's measure of future business conditions dropped to a more than two-year low.

""This month's decline in the Empire State six-month forward index may reflect trade-related uncertainties and the associated volatility of stocks, or other factors,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers cut their spending by the most in more than five years in early 2018 as heavy snowfalls combined with an ongoing squeeze on household budgets to hit retailers, payments company Visa said on Monday.
Visa said inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the three month to the end of March was 1.4 percent lower than a year earlier - the biggest fall since the fourth quarter of 2012 - after a 1.3 percent fall in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Spending in March alone fell by the most since October, down 2.1 percent on the year after a 1.0 percent fall in February.
Visa said the weakness in consumer spending reflected a dip in confidence among many households as well as unusually snowy weather.
""That said, it is too early to read a great deal into this year-on-year decline, which should be viewed in the context of high growth rates in early 2017,"" Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, said.
Online sales fell for the first time in 10 months. Last month online supermarket Ocado (L:OCDO) reported that its sales suffered after snow storms disrupted its deliveries.
Britain's overall economy appears to have slowed in early 2018 as the snow added to uncertainty about the country's departure from the European Union next year.
Visa said only spending on food and in hotels, restaurants and bars rose in March, probably due in part to the early Easter holiday weekend.
Official retail sales figures, due on Thursday, are also expected to show a fall in spending in March.
Figures published by the British Retail Consortium on Monday showed a 6 percent fall in the number of people visiting retailers, the biggest annual drop since the end of 2010, reflecting the bad weather.
For more than a year, British consumers have been hit by a double-whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation caused largely by the pound's plunge after the 2016 Brexit vote. But there are signs that the worst of the squeeze has passed.
Official figures due this week are expected to show the strongest wage growth in nearly two-and-a-half years at 3.0 percent in the three months to February, while inflation is forecast to have held at 2.7 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
That would represent the first time that wages have grown more strongly than inflation since March of last year.
The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next month for only the second time since the start of the global financial crisis more than 10 years ago, due in large part to signs that wage growth is picking up.

Visa's data is based on spending on its debit, credit and prepaid cards, which account for about a third of consumer spending. The growth rates are adjusted for inflation, seasonal effects and differences between typical card and cash spending.

The preliminary publication of the data for April from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment fell to 97.8 last month.
That was compared to March’s 14-year high of 101.4.
Analysts had forecast a drop to just 100.6.
The current conditions indicator decreased to 115.0 in April, from the previous 121.2.
Economists had projected that the index would fall to only 120.0.
Furthermore, consumer expectations dropped to 86.8 in April, from the prior reading of 88.8.
That missed consensus that had expected a decline to 88.1.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months fell to 2.7% from 2.8%, while the five-year gauge declined to 2.4% from the previous 2.5%.
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that the small decline was widely shared by all age and income subgroups and across all regions of the country.
“Importantly, confidence still remains relatively high, despite the recent losses that were mainly due to concerns about the potential impact of Trump's trade policies on the domestic economy,” he explained.
“Uncertainty surrounding the evolving trade policy has caused many small (and at times inconsistent) changes in expectations,” Curtin added.
This expert said that spontaneous references to trade policies in the survey were made by 29% of all consumers in early April, with nearly all the mentions negative.
Curtin further noted that there were other factors responsible for the small overall April decline and highlighted the expectation of rising interest rates, which slightly slowed the anticipated pace of growth in the economy.
“Overall, the data are consistent with a growth rate of 2.7% in consumption from mid-2018 to mid-2019,” he concluded."

258,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>",China's trade surplus with U.S. soars in first quarter but March exports falter,"By Elias Glenn and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade surplus with the United States surged nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, with some analysts speculating exporters were rushing out shipments to get ahead of threatened tariffs that are spurring fears of a full-blown trade war.
The latest readings on the health of China's trade sector are unlikely to ease tensions following weeks of tit-for-tat tariff threats by Washington and Beijing, though they suggest China's economy is still in relatively solid shape.
Even as China's trade surplus narrowed overall in the first three months of the year, its surplus with the U.S. surged 19.4 percent to $58.25 billion from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday.
While China was busy selling more to the U.S., it was buying more from other countries, and ran a $9.86 billion deficit with the rest of the world in the quarter.
China's overall exports and imports both grew at a strong double-digit clip early in the year, and while exports unexpectedly fell in March -- resulting in a rare trade deficit -- most analysts chalked it up to seasonal factors and said it was too early to call a trend.
Still, while no hard timeline has been set by either Washington or Beijing for the actual imposition of tariffs, analysts said China's exporters may already be adapting their strategies as punitive trade measures loom.
China's first-quarter exports to the U.S. rose 14.8 percent from a year earlier, despite a 5.6 percent drop in March. Its imports from the U.S. rose 8.9 percent in the quarter and 3.2 percent in March.
That helped narrow its surplus with the U.S. in March alone to $15.43 billion from $20.96 billion in February, but that was still nearly 18 percent higher than March 2017.
""The sharp decline in March export growth after very solid performance in January and February suggests some exporters may have front-loaded exports (early) this year due to concern over the possibility of a Sino-U.S. trade war after the U.S. hiked tariffs on global imports on solar panels and washing machines,"" said Lisheng Wang, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong.
""We believe export growth will slow due to yuan appreciation and rising trade tensions...China's imports could be more resilient than exports in our view as China has pledged to increase imports,"" Wang said.
China's total aluminum exports in March rose to their highest since June, just as the United States imposed tariffs on imports of the metal and steel on March 23. 
SEASONAL EXPORT DIP IN MARCH
For the first quarter as a whole, China's exports grew a hearty 14.1 percent from a year earlier.
March shipments fell 2.7 percent, however, lagging analysts' forecasts for a 10.0 percent increase, and down from a sharper-than-expected 44.5 percent jump in February, which economists believe was heavily distorted by seasonal factors.
""Most of (the March) drop is seasonal – Chinese New Year was later than usual this year, meaning more of the holiday disruptions will have dragged into March than in 2017,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 
March import growth of 14.4 percent beat expectations, however, suggesting China's domestic demand may still be solid enough to cushion the blow from any trade shocks.
Analysts had expected imports to grow 10.0 percent in March, picking up from 6.3 percent growth in February. 
That produced an unexpected trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, but such shortfalls are not uncommon for China early in the year, again likely due to holiday distortions.
For Jan-March, imports rose a strong 18.9 percent on-year. 
Imports of commodities continued to lead the way in March as manufacturers replenished inventories ahead of a seasonal pick-up in demand. Shipments of copper, crude oil, iron ore and soybeans all rose from the previous month. 
Analysts are still expecting China's economic growth to slow later in the year, however, as a cooling property market weighs on demand for building materials from cement to steel.
OUTLOOK CLOUDY
China's exports rode a global trade boom last year, expanding at the fastest pace since 2013 and serving as one of the key drivers behind the economy's forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion.
But the sudden spike in trade tensions with the United States is clouding the outlook for both China's ""old economy"" heavy industries and ""new economy"" tech firms alike.
Washington says China's $375 billion trade surplus with the United States is unacceptable, and has demanded Beijing reduce it by $100 billion immediately.
In a move to further force China to lower the billions of goods trade surplus running with the U.S., Trump unveiled tariff representing about $50 billion of technology, transport and medical products early this month, drawing an immediate threat of retaliatory action from Beijing.
China's tech sector, which is key part of Beijing's longer-term ""Made in China 2025"" strategy to move from cheap goods to higher-value manufacturing, may be particularly vulnerable.

Hi-tech products have been among its fastest growing export segments. China exported $137.8 billion worth of high-tech products in the first quarter, up 20.5 percent on-year.

China's March trade surplus with the U.S. fell to $15.32 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on official data, compared with $20.96 billion for February.
The data follows weeks of tit-for-tat tariff threats by Washington and Beijing, sparked by U.S. frustration with China's massive bilateral trade surplus and intellectual property policies, which have fueled fears of a global trade war.
China's exports to the U.S. increased 14.8 percent from a year earlier in January-March period, spokesman Huang Songping told a briefing in Beijing, while imports from the U.S. also rose 8.9 percent.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices unchanged on weak petroleum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices were unexpectedly flat in March as a drop in the cost of petroleum products was offset by increases in the prices of food and a range of other goods.
The Labor Department said on Thursday last month's unchanged reading followed a slightly downwardly revised 0.3 percent increase in February. March's reading was the weakest since last July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices gaining 0.2 percent in March after a previously reported 0.4 percent rise in February.
In the 12 months through March, import prices increased 3.6 percent, the biggest gain since April 2017, after advancing 3.4 percent in February.
Last month, prices for imported petroleum decreased 1.3 percent after falling 0.8 percent in February. Excluding petroleum, import prices gained 0.1 percent in March after climbing 0.4 percent in the prior month. These prices have risen strongly this year, reflecting the dollar's depreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners.
Import prices excluding petroleum rose 2.1 percent in the 12 months through March. Data on Tuesday showed a broad increase in producer prices in March. The steady rise in import prices excluding petroleum and producer prices suggest that an energy-driven drop in consumer prices in March was probably temporary.
Economists expect inflation will accelerate this year, boosted by a tightening labor market, weaker dollar and fiscal stimulus. Inflation has undershot the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
The cost of imported food increased 0.6 percent in March, while prices for imported capital goods gained 0.2 percent. There were also increases in the prices of imported building materials and unfinished metals related to durable goods.
Prices for imported motor vehicles fell 0.2 percent. Prices of consumer goods excluding automobiles dipped 0.1 percent.
The price of goods imported from China edged up 0.1 percent in March, rising for a second straight month. Prices for imports from China increased 0.2 percent in the 12 months through March.
The report also showed export prices rose 0.3 percent in March after increasing 0.2 percent in February. Export prices advanced 3.4 percent on a year-on-year basis after rising 3.2 percent in February.
The price of agricultural exports surged 3.4 percent, the biggest increase since August 2012, boosted by a 7.8 percent jump in soybean prices. Agricultural export prices rose 0.6 percent in February. Wheat prices rose 8.0 percent in March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite a sharp slowdown in job growth in March.
While other data on Thursday showed import prices were flat in March amid a sharp drop in the cost of petroleum products, underlying imported inflation pressures are steadily rising. This together with a tightening labor market strengthens expectations inflation will gain steam this year. 
Economists say a trade war between the United States and China could fan price pressures and push the Federal Reserve on to a more aggressive path of interest rate increases. Washington and Beijing have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars' worth of tariffs. The Fed raised interest rates last month and forecast at least two more rate hikes this year. 
""As long as we don't get into a trade war where tariffs are slapped on all sorts of things, the Fed should be able to maintain its slow tightening process,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""But tit-for-tat tariffs would raise prices and that would create real concerns at the Fed.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended April 7, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 230,000 in the latest week. 
Claims tend to be volatile around this time of year because of different timings of the Easter and school spring breaks, which can throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,750 to 230,000 last week.
The economy created 103,000 jobs in March, the fewest in six months. Economists largely dismissed the slowdown as payback after hefty job gains in February. They also blamed cooler temperatures for the moderation in hiring.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's March 20-21 policy meeting published on Wednesday offered an upbeat assessment of the jobs market, noting that ""most participants described labor market conditions as strong."" 
The minutes also highlighted growing labor shortages saying ""in some districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing shortages of workers in segments of the labor market.""
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies after President Donald Trump cast doubt over the timing of his threatened strike on Syria in response to a reported poison gas attack. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
CHEAP PETROLEUM 
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said March's unchanged reading in import prices was the weakest since last July and followed a 0.3 percent increase in February.
Import prices increased 3.6 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain since April 2017, after advancing 3.4 percent in February. Prices for imported petroleum decreased 1.3 percent in March after falling 0.8 percent in February.
Excluding petroleum, import prices gained 0.1 percent in March after climbing 0.4 percent in the prior month. These prices have risen strongly this year, reflecting the dollar's depreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners.
Import prices excluding petroleum rose 2.1 percent in the 12 months through March. The cost of imported food increased 0.6 percent in March, while prices for imported capital goods gained 0.2 percent. 
There were also increases in prices of imported base metals, which economists attributed to pre-buying ahead of the steel and aluminum tariffs which came into effect in late March.
The price of goods imported from China edged up 0.1 percent in March, rising for a second straight month. Prices for imports from China increased 0.2 percent in the 12 months through March.

""The continued firming will likely underpin stronger nonfuel import price inflation going forward,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""In turn, higher import prices will support rising domestic prices, but with only a moderate pass-through.""

263,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>","ECB frets over euro strength, trade war risk: minutes","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers gathering last month expressed concern over the risk of a full-fledged trade war with the United States and fretted over the potentially harmful impact of the euro's strength, the minutes of meeting showed.
With the euro zone economy growing for five straight years, policymakers are now debating how to wean the bloc off easy money and prepare investors for normalizing policy a decade after the global financial crisis sent central banks into crisis mode. 
The ECB has so far moved by increments to dial back support. In March, it gave up a largely outdated pledge to raise asset buys if needed, a symbolic move that kept it on course to end its 2.55 trillion asset purchase program by the end of this year.
While the euro's firming in recent months, partly due to fears over U.S. protectionism, has not significantly curtailed demand, policymakers called the exchange rate a ""significant source"" of uncertainty with some predicting a more negative impact on inflation.
""It was remarked that the recent movements in the euro exchange rate seemed to relate more to the relative monetary policy shocks, including communication, and less to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook,"" the minutes showed.
""This suggested that the exchange rate appreciation could be expected to have a more negative impact on inflation."" 
Investors have been wondering whether the ECB's carefully calibrated exit plan from its ultra easy policy could be scuppered by a looming trade war between the United States and China although ECB policymakers have so far played down this risk.
""There was widespread concern that the risk of trade conflicts, which could be expected to have an adverse impact on activity for all countries involved, had increased,"" the ECB said. ""It was also cautioned that negative confidence effects could arise.""
Launched three years ago, the ECB's bond buys depressed borrowing costs, kick-started growth and helped fight off the threat of deflation.
But inflation, the ECB's singular mandate, has remained weak and will undershoot the bank's nearly 2 percent target for years to come, a threat to the bank's credibility.
Still, policymakers argue that with spare capacity largely exhausted in the bloc and growth motoring ahead, it is only a matter of time before inflation picks up so the ECB can afford to dial back is stimulus and give price growth time to accelerate.
A view was put forward arguing that the ECB was close to meeting its criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation but there was broad agreement that progress is not yet sufficient. 
Still, policymakers were in agreement that their confidence has increased that inflation would gradually rise back towards target, if only the bank was patient enough. 
""The increased confidence called for a gradual adjustment in the Governing Council’s communication,"" the accounts showed,"" the ECB said.

Once bond buys end, investor focus will turn to interest rates as the ECB has said they would stay unchanged 'well past' the bond buys end, an ill defined timeline that is seen by market as roughly six months.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 06:43AM ET</span>","Global trade growth strong but at risk if conflict escalates, WTO says","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - World trade in goods is maintaining a robust recovery, but it still might falter if trade tensions escalate further, the World Trade Organization said in its annual forecast on Thursday. 
Trade in goods will grow 4.4 percent this year after a decade averaging 3.0 percent a year following the financial crisis. Last year it grew 4.7 percent - much higher than the 3.6 percent forecast in September - and a further 4.0 percent rise is expected in 2019, the WTO said. 
""However, this important progress could be quickly undermined if governments resort to restrictive trade policies, especially in a tit-for-tat process that could lead to an unmanageable escalation,"" WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement. ""A cycle of retaliation is the last thing the world economy needs.""
The United States and China have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars' worth of tariffs in recent weeks, leading to worries that Washington and Beijing may engage in an all-out trade war.
The WTO's 2018 forecast puts world trade growth at the top end of previous expectations, since the organization said last September that it expected 2018 growth of 1.4 to 4.4 percent, most likely around 3.2 percent.
The latest forecast raises that to 3.1 to 5.5 percent based on current GDP forecasts, but ""a continued escalation of trade restrictive policies could lead to a significantly lower figure,"" the WTO said.
""These forecasts do not, and I repeat, they do not factor in the possibility of a dramatic escalation of trade restrictions,"" Azevedo told a news conference.
""It is not possible to accurately map out the effects of a major escalation, but clearly they could be serious,"" he said. ""Poorer countries would stand to lose the most.""
CHINA KEY TO GROWTH
New trade restrictions could trigger cycles of retaliation that weigh on global trade and output, but disruption could equally come from central banks raising interest rates rapidly or from geopolitical tensions, it said. 
Cyber attacks were a further risk, with potentially even greater impact on trade in services than trade in goods. Trade in commercial services grew by 7.4 percent in 2017, after two years of weak or negative growth, the WTO said. 
Last year's growth in goods trade was led by Asia, by investment spending and by higher commodity prices. China's rebalancing away from investment and towards consumption could mean it imports fewer capital goods, putting a drag on world trade growth.
""Less investment could also help reduce overcapacity in sensitive sectors such as steel and aluminum, thereby alleviating trade tensions,"" the WTO said.
Steel and aluminum were the targets of one of U.S. President Donald Trump's three big tariff announcements this year, each more controversial than the one before.
The steel and aluminum tariffs, justified on national security grounds, came soon after a restriction on imports of solar panels and washing machines. They preceded a huge package of tariffs that Trump has proposed to punish China for its alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.

China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that Washington's attempts at dialogue were not sincere and vowed to retaliate should Trump escalate further.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production was much weaker than expected in February, data showed on Thursday, pointing to slower economic growth in the first quarter and no quick policy tightening from the European Central Bank.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.8 percent month-on-month for a 2.9 percent year-on-year rise. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1 percent month-on-month increase and a 3.8 percent annual gain.
Eurostat also revised upwards its data for January to a 0.6 percent monthly decline from the previously reported -1.0 percent and to a 3.7 percent year-on-year rise from 2.7.
Industrial production accounts for some 20 percent of euro zone gross domestic product.
""Weak industrial production figures point to some growth deceleration in the first quarter. While there’s no reason to panic yet, it seems as if GDP growth is already past its peak,"" ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said.
The weaker February result was due to falling production in all categories - intermediate goods, capital goods, durable and non-durable consumer goods -- except energy, the output of which surged 6.8 percent on the month after a 1.1 percent monthly decline in January. 
Year-on-year, energy production rose 5.7 percent in February after an 8.9 percent plunge in January, but all other components showed a smaller annual rise compared with the month before.
Average quarterly growth in the euro zone in 2017 was 0.6 percent, but first-quarter growth would be lower, said Nicola Nobile, the lead euro zone economist at Oxford Economics.
""This will not bode well for GDP growth, which we now expect only expanding by 0.4 percent in the first quarter, 0.2 percentage points lower than the average quarterly growth rates for 2017. The 0.7 growth rates of mid-2017 now seem a thing of the past,"" Nobile said.
The moderation in growth momentum is likely to keep euro zone inflation subdued and well below the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. Inflation in March was 1.4 percent year-on-year.

""In these circumstances the ECB is unlikely to become more hawkish. We expect a first rate hike at the earliest in June 2019,"" ING's Vanden Houte said.

In recent days “we gradually released first quarter economic data; it’s a little bit better than expected,” Yi said Thursday at a conference the central bank hosted with the International Monetary Fund in Beijing. “It’s a good sign for this year’s growth agenda.”
March data showed that the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index posted its first gain since November with an increase that exceeded all but one estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. Factory output and fixed investment also beat economists’ projections in the first two months of 2018.
Yi’s comments come just before the April 17 report on first quarter gross domestic product, which economists forecast will show a 6.8 percent expansion. That would be in line with the prior two quarters and slightly slower than the 6.9 percent pace in the first half of last year.
“China’s economy performed well in the first quarter thanks to robust domestic consumption and trade, as well as better-than-expected investment,” said Wen Bin, a researcher at China Minsheng Banking Corp. in Beijing. “A big uncertainty ahead is the potential impact of China-U.S. trade tension.”
March export data due for release Friday morning in Beijing are forecast to show imports picked up as export growth moderated after a February surge. Wen said robust export data could continue this quarter, boosting economic performance in the first half as companies seek to front-load overseas shipments ahead of potential tariffs.
The Bloomberg Economics China Surprise Index, a gauge of how data compare with estimates in surveys of economists, rose in February to the highest level in more than a year.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>","Bank of Korea keeps interest rates steady on muted inflation, trade uncertainty","By Cynthia Kim and Christine Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as expected, with inflation running more slowly than forecast and exports showing a modest improvement. 
The Bank of Korea's Monetary Policy Board voted to keep the benchmark interest rate  at 1.50 percent, leaving its monetary policy setting unchanged since raising it in November from a record-low 1.25 percent. 
All 18 analysts surveyed by Reuters between April 4 and 10 predicted the BOK would keep the seven-day repurchase rate unchanged on Thursday.
Headline inflation has held below the bank's target of 2 percent since October last year, raising doubts about the bank's next steps even as other economies dial back crisis-era stimulus policies. 
Inflation slowed to 1.3 percent in March from 1.4 percent a month earlier, cementing a consensus view that any monetary tightening this year will be gradual.
With fears of a global trade war clouding the growth outlook, policymakers worry the export growth that had supported the economy for most of 2017 could fizzle out. 
""As South Korea is more sensitive to changes in global demand than others, it's a big worry for Korea's growth outlook,"" said Kong Dong-rak, an economist at Daishin Securities. 
""Inflation is unlikely to reach the target level for a while and would offer no urgency for the bank to raise rates for now,"" said Kong, who now sees a 25 basis point hike in the third quarter. Kong previously saw a rate hike in May. 
A U.S.-China trade dispute escalated as China stepped up its threats of retaliation against the Trump administration's proposed heavy tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imported Chinese goods.
But Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed this week to further open the country's economy, raising hopes of a compromise, but South Korean policymakers are wary of risks to exports as any friction between the economic superpowers could have spillover effects on the Korea's trade-reliant economy.
Exports grew 10.3 percent in January-March combined from a year earlier, slower than the 14.6 percent expansion seen during the same period in 2017. 
Growth declined 0.2 percent on-quarter and marked its worst quarterly performance since 2008 in October-December as weakness in car exports and construction overshadowed strength in consumption and public spending. 
""There is no compelling reason for the BOK to tighten at this point, as inflation remains benign, credit growth is moderate, and the won has stayed stable despite the Fed’s March rate hike,"" said Ma Tie-ying, an economist at DBS Bank. 
The central bank is due to release new economic estimates at 1:30 p.m. (0430 GMT). 
Currently, the BOK expects the economy to expand by 3 percent this year after 3.1 percent growth in 2017, the fastest expansion since it grew 3.3 percent in 2014.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK business lobby says economy 'treading water' since start of year,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy has been treading water since the start of the year and inflation pressures are easing, limiting the case for the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday.
The BCC's quarterly economic survey - the largest of its kind - showed a familiar picture of lackluster domestic demand, only partly mitigated by the boost to foreign demand from the fall in the value of the pound since June 2016's Brexit vote. 
""What growth we see in the UK economy is due principally to strong global trading conditions, rather than domestic demand, which remains muted,"" the BCC's director-general, Adam Marshall, said.
Britain's economy recorded the weakest year-on-year growth of any major economy in late 2017, as consumers struggled with higher inflation caused by the weak pound, and more recent official data points to a further slowdown in early 2018.
However, the BoE said in February that the economy was close to reaching its capacity to grow without generating excessive inflation, leading investors to predict that a rate rise is coming next month. 
Two of the BoE's nine policymakers voted for a rate rise at their last meeting in March, citing evidence of rising domestic inflation pressures in business surveys.
The BCC said this was not the experience of its members. Fewer firms expect to raise prices than in late 2017, and rising pay demands from workers were a problem for under a quarter of businesses, the survey showed.
""Inflation is now on a downward trajectory,"" BCC economist Suren Thiru said. ""While we expect interest rates to rise next month, with UK economic conditions subdued and inflation weakening, the case for a further tightening in monetary policy continues to look limited at best.""
Manufacturers in the BCC survey reported the fastest growth in export sales and orders since the second quarter of 2014. But domestic sales grew at the weakest rate since late 2016.
Services businesses reported steady domestic sales growth but only a minimal pick-up in the rate of export expansion.
""Even with a standout performance from manufacturing exporters able to reap the benefits of lower sterling, the UK economy as a whole is treading water, rather than powering ahead,"" Marshall said.

The BCC surveyed more than 7,000 businesses from Feb. 19 to March 12, before Prime Minister Theresa May reached a provisional agreement with the European Union on trading terms after Britain leaves the bloc in just under a year.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>","Federal Reserve policymakers all saw strengthening economy, inflation: minutes","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All of the Federal Reserve's policymakers felt that the U.S. economy would firm further and that inflation would rise in the coming months, minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting on March 20-21 released on Wednesday showed.
The readout of the meeting, at which the Fed unanimously voted to raise borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point, also showed that policymakers were wary about the impact of the Trump administration's trade and fiscal policies.
""All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,"" the Fed said in the minutes. ""In addition, all participants expected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in coming months.""
U.S. stocks, Treasuries and the dollar were little changed following their publication.
""From a market sense there's not much for people to take away here, they are still looking for a gradual pace of hikes. I think the debate rages on whether that means three this year of four this year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.
The Fed's target range for its benchmark lending rate is currently between 1.50 and 1.75 percent. The increase in March was the sixth rise since the central bank began a tightening cycle back in December 2015.
As the economy has strengthened, the Fed has upped the pace of hikes. It sees another two rate rises this year, although quarterly forecasts at the last meeting showed more officials than in December were supportive of three more hikes in 2018.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation currently sits at 1.6 percent and has undershot its 2 percent target rate for six years but various indicators have recently pointed to an uptick in price pressures.
Policymakers also see additional impetus from an economy in which the labor market is tightening, the dollar weakening and the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package and increased government spending yet to impact on the economy.
Earlier on Wednesday, one of the Fed's key measures of consumer prices, the so-called core CPI, rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in March, the largest advance since February 2017, after increasing 1.8 percent in February.
U.S. TRADE POLICY WORRIES
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last Friday that the central bank would likely need to keep raising rates to keep inflation under control, but also pledged to stick to a gradual path.
However, the meeting minutes showed that already some Fed officials worried the central bank would have to move faster than previously expected.
A number said the outlook for the economy and inflation could lead to a slightly steeper path of rate increases over the next few years and some suggested that at a given point the Fed might have to change its statement language to acknowledge monetary policy would have to move to a neutral or ""restraining factor"" for economic activity.
Several thought it would likely also become appropriate at some point for interest rates to rise above the Fed's longer-run estimate for a time.
One potential headache for Fed officials remains threats of tit-for-tat tariffs worth tens of billions of dollars between the Trump administration and China, which if implemented could damage U.S. growth and raise consumer prices. Those tensions have roiled financial markets over potential damage to global growth.
In the minutes, Fed policymakers showed concern about this as well as uncertainty about the implication of Trump's stimulus on fiscal sustainability and real interest rates.
""A strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy,"" the minutes read.
Since the March meeting, Fed officials have largely adopted a wait-and-see attitude to trade policy, noting it is not yet clear if the tariffs will go into effect and their eventual size if implemented.
The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged at its next policy meeting on May 1-2, but investors overwhelmingly see another rate increase at the following one in mid June.

That compared with a budget deficit of $176 billion in the same month last year, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury recording a $194 billion shortfall last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $165 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $134 billion in the same month in the prior year.
The deficit for the fiscal year, which began in October, was $600 billion, compared to a deficit of $527 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017.

The country is undergoing a major crisis, with millions of people suffering from food shortages, hyperinflation and a currency that weakens significantly every day.
Annual inflation over the last 12 months, according to the National Assembly, is just shy of 8,900 percent. Monthly inflation in March was 67 percent, down from 80 percent the previous month. The country's central bank has not published inflation data for more than two years.
However, it does publish money supply data, the sum of cash, with checking, savings, and other deposits. That has risen more than 2,900 percent in the last 12 months, which, without an increase in the supply of goods and services, is a textbook cause of inflation.
President Nicolas Maduro blames the problems on an ""economic war"" being waged against Venezuela by the United States, the opposition and business people.
In June, the bolivar currency will be redenominated by having three zeros lopped off though there will be no change in its value, which has dropped well over 99 percent against the U.S. dollar since Maduro came to power in 2013.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 02:57PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer prices drop, but core inflation firming","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in 10 months in March, weighed down by a decline in the cost of gasoline, but underlying inflation continued to firm amid rising prices for healthcare and rental accommodation.
The drop in the headline monthly inflation reading reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday is likely temporary as producer prices increased solidly in March. 
In addition, the tightening labor market is expected to start generating significant wage inflation in the second half of the year. As such, many economists believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates three more times this year.
The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs last month and forecast at least two additional rate hikes in 2018. 
""U.S. inflation is warming up rather than heating up,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Still, the upward trend could suffice to nudge the Fed three more times this year.""
The Consumer Price Index slipped 0.1 percent last month, the first and largest drop since May 2017, after climbing 0.2 percent in February, the Labor Department said. 
In the 12 months through March, the CPI increased 2.4 percent. That was the largest annual gain in a year and followed February's 2.2 percent increase. Annual inflation is rising as the big price declines from last year drop from the calculation.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent, matching February's increase. 
The so-called core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in March, the largest advance since February 2017, after increasing 1.8 percent in February. The annual core CPI also accelerated as the drag from last year's plunge in prices for cellphone service plans dropped out of the calculation.
The core CPI is now well above the 1.8 percent annual average increase over the past 10 years. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI unchanged in March and the core CPI rising 0.2 percent from the prior month. 
The Fed tracks a different index, the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) excluding food and energy, which has consistently run below the central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012. 
FLIRTING WITH TARGET
Last year's low prices for cellphone service plans are also expected to fall out of the calculation for March PCE price index data, which is scheduled for release on April 30.
This factor is was also highlighted in minutes of the Fed's March 20-21 policy meeting published on Wednesday.
According to the minutes, ""several participants noted that the 12-month PCE price inflation rate would likely shift upward when the March data are released because the effects of the outsized decline in the prices of cell phone service plans in March of last year will drop out of that calculation."" 
Economists are forecasting the core PCE price index increasing 1.9 percent year-on-year in March after rising 1.6 percent in February. 
""This suggests to us that the Fed's preferred core PCE price inflation rate will be running at 2.0 percent by the June report, if not sooner,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly down as investors worried about rising tensions between the United States and Russia over a possible U.S. military action against Syria.
Inflation is also expected to get a boost from a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package and increased government spending, as well as a weakening U.S. dollar. 
Gasoline prices tumbled 4.9 percent in March, the largest drop since last May, after falling 0.9 percent in February. Food prices edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in February.
The core CPI was lifted by rising rents and healthcare costs. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent last month after climbing 0.2 percent in February.
Healthcare costs shot up 0.4 percent, with prices for hospital care jumping 0.6 percent and the cost of doctor visits rising 0.2 percent. Healthcare costs increased 2.0 percent year-on-year, below the 2.9 percent average annual rate over the past 10 years.
Apparel prices fell 0.6 percent after two straight months of robust gains. There were also declines in the cost of telecommunication, used cars and trucks, tobacco and education. 

Prices for new motor vehicles and recreation were unchanged last month.

Consumer inflation rose by an annualized 2.4% in March the Labor Department said, up from 2.2% in the previous month. The reading matched the consensus forecast.
Although markets have been focusing lately on headlines related to the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, inflation remains a concern as increasing price pressures would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently forecast.
Markets widely expect the next rate hike to arrive in June and forecast a third increase to be implemented by the end of the year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
However, some policymakers, including former Fed chair Janet Yellen, have suggested that a total of four hikes in 2018 could be appropriate.
Month-on-month, CPI fell 0.1%, below the consensus forecast that the reading would show no change.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.2% from a month earlier, in line with the consensus forecast.
In the 12 months through March, core CPI rose 2.1% in March. That matched the consensus forecast although it was higher than the previous month’s 1.8% increase.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Market participants will also be keeping a close eye on the publication, at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT) Wednesday, of the minutes from the last Fed policy decision in March to see the level of discussion surrounding the possibility of a slightly swifter move up in interest rates."

The rebound comes after China vehicles sales in February fell 11.1 percent from a year earlier amid faltering growth in the market since the second half of last year.
Vehicle sales in the first quarter were up 2.8 percent compared with the same period last year.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has predicted a 3 percent market growth this year, in line with 2017, but significantly below the steep 13.7 percent gain in 2016. Sales last year missed a target of 5 percent growth.
A CAAM official said plans to cut tariffs on imported cars would pressure domestic automakers, although they should be able to bear it. President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday China would ""considerably reduce auto import tariffs"".
Asked about the plans, CAAM assistant secretary general Xu Haidong said he did not expect auto import tariffs to be cut that low, but that a reduction to 5 percent could drag domestic auto market profits down 20 percent versus current levels. The tariff on imported cars is 25 percent now.
CAAM said sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), referring to pure electric and plug-in hybrids, rose 117.4 percent in March to 67,778 units. Sales of NEVs in the first three months of the year were up 154.3 percent at 142,577 vehicles.
China is making a major push to support the NEV sector and drive a shift away from traditional petrol-engine cars, though it is looking to wean the sector off subsidies that have helped drive rapid growth.
CAAM has previously said the NEV market would grow around 40 percent this year to top sales of 1 million low-energy cars.
The industry body said that German, French and Japanese carmakers had seen a rise in passenger vehicles sales overall in the first quarter, while South Korean and U.S. firms had seen sales slip against the same period last year.

Chinese brands took a 45.19 percent share of the overall market in the Jan-March period, slightly down against 2017.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 05:59AM ET</span>",UK factory output falls for first time in almost a year,"By Andy Bruce and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing output fell unexpectedly in February, its first month-on-month drop in almost a year, adding to signs the economy may have slowed in the first quarter.
The official data, released on Wednesday along with figures for overseas trade, also showed another sharp drop in construction output, defying expectations for a small rebound after a severe downturn in January.
The pace of economic growth slowed slightly in 2017 as consumers suffered from higher inflation caused by a fall in sterling after June 2016's Brexit vote.
Overall, Wednesday's data mostly chimed with business surveys that suggest Britain's economy cooled further in early 2018, weighed down in part by snow storms in late February and early March.
Manufacturing output, which was a bright spot last year thanks to the strong global economy, fell 0.2 percent month-on-month in February after stagnating in January, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
That marked the first drop since March 2017 and was worse than the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a 0.2 percent rise.
British government bond futures briefly touched a session high after the data was released, while sterling slipped below $1.42.
""The modest stimulus to growth from sterling's 2016 depreciation has begun to fade, while the global trade upswing has lost some momentum too,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Tombs said the figures looked consistent with first-quarter economic growth of around 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter - weaker than the Bank of England's forecast of 0.3 percent and the 0.4 percent recorded in the last three months of 2017.
But the EEF manufacturing association said February's dip in manufacturing output looked ""more like a temporary wobble than a turn for the worse"".
The subdued figures will interest Bank of England officials who are widely expected to raise interest rates next month for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis.
In February the central bank raised its growth forecasts for Britain due to the improving global economy and said interest rates were likely to rise somewhat faster and to a slightly greater extent than it had expected in late 2017.
Manufacturing output was 2.5 percent higher than its level in February 2017, again less than the 3.3 percent Reuters poll consensus, the ONS said.
Overall industrial output, which combines manufacturing and energy production, rose 0.1 percent in February, compared with a 1.3 percent expansion in January and weaker than the 0.4 percent consensus in the Reuters poll.
Industrial output accounts for 14 percent of Britain's overall economic output.
CONSTRUCTION SAGS AGAIN, TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS
Construction output in February dropped 1.6 percent month-on-month after a 3.1 percent plunge in January - confounding the consensus expectation for a 0.7 percent rebound.
There was some anecdotal evidence that heavy snow in late February had hurt construction output, although the effect was difficult to quantify, the ONS said.
Separate figures on Britain's trade performance brought better news, however.
Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed to 10.203 billion pounds ($14.48 billion) in February from 12.228 billion pounds in January - the smallest gap since September and better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had pointed to a deficit of 11.95 billion pounds.
The fall reflected a sharp drop in imports rather than an improvement in exports, both in value and volume terms.

The central bank cut its growth estimate to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent. A source there said it would not be altering its full-year forecast for now.
The French data mirrors a broader dip in the euro zone economy. On Monday, European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said the bloc was experiencing a largely anticipated correction, rather than a slowdown, after growth rates reached multi-year highs.
The Bank of France's business sentiment indicator for the manufacturing industry fell to 103 points in March from 105 in the previous month, with a sharp decline in orders as deliveries slowed.
Business leaders expected industrial production to grow at a moderate pace in April, the bank said.
Its equivalent indicator for the country's services sector held steady at 103 points, hovering around its highest since May 2011, and the central bank said staff levels continued to increase fairly rapidly.
Official readings of business and consumer confidence have scaled multi-year peaks since President Emmanuel Macron was elected last May on a ticket to reform the economy and help businesses.

Strong growth since Macron became president has given the former investment banker a tailwind as he seeks to modernise the euro zone's second biggest economy, and his government will be keen to maintain that economic momentum at a time of growing domestic discontent towards his reform agenda.

China's central bank governor Yi Gang said last month that he believes consumer inflation pressures would be mild this year, and that producer price increases would slow down.
His comments came amid escalating trade tensions between China and the U.S., which could push up inflation over the coming months, according to analysts.

280,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 10:31PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Inflation Slows as Consumer Price Gains Ease,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation slowed for a fifth month while the consumer price index retreated from a four-year high.
The producer price index rose 3.1 percent in March from a year earlier, compared with the projected 3.3 percent rise in a Bloomberg survey and 3.7 percent in February. The consumer price index climbed 2.1 percent, the statistics bureau said Wednesday, versus a forecast of 2.6 percent and 2.9 percent in February.
The slowest factory inflation in more than a year may offer limited support to the world reflation cycle, amid rising trade tensions that may weigh on synchronized global growth. Domestic consumer prices are forecast to rise this year, while tariffs added to imports of U.S. products from soybeans to cars may boost inflation if implemented.
The slower PPI reading is in line with a Bloomberg Economics tracker, which uses daily movements of commodity prices to predict the monthly PPI reading.
“For now, there’s no sign of China exporting inflation to the world,” said Li Wei, a senior economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc in Shanghai, who predicts both PPI and CPI will stabilize in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent in the second half of 2018. “Policy makers won’t focus on inflation this year, instead they’ll prioritize tasks such as cutting leverage.”
The fading of the Lunar New Year holiday effects in March was the main reason for the CPI deceleration, the statistics bureau said in a statement released with the data.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 01:03AM ET</span>","China March factory, consumer inflation slows in sign of ebbing economic growth","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation cooled to a 17-month low in March, probably indicating an ebbing in demand and backing expectations of a broader slackening in economic growth this year as authorities extend a clamp-down on financial risks. 
Consumer inflation also eased sharply in the previous month as the effects of booming demand spurred by the Lunar New Year holiday in February receded, official data showed on Wednesday. 
The data comes amid some worries that an escalating trade dispute between China and the United States could stoke price pressures over the coming months, though many analysts believe any impact on consumer prices will be limited.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 3.1 percent in March from a year earlier, below a 3.7 percent gain in February, the National Statistics Bureau said, partly reflecting a high-base effect from last year.
China's factory-gate inflation has now softened for five months in a row, supporting the view that a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is inevitable, hurt by rising borrowing costs and a cooling property market on the back of Beijing's crack down on debt risks.
""With the anti-pollution campaign – which pushed up prices by disrupting supply – now unwinding, the impact of weaker demand for industrial goods is becoming more apparent in the PPI data,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected March producer inflation would moderate slightly to 3.2 percent. On a month-on-month basis, the PPI fell 0.2 percent versus 0.1 percent decline in February, as the months-long smog war that led to supply constraints and an uptick in factory prices tapered off. 
Gains in raw material prices slowed to 5.1 percent in March from 5.9 percent the month before. 
The softer factory gate inflation points to further pressure on profits for China's industrial firms after earnings grew at their quickest pace in six years in 2017. Profits at industrial firms picked up pace in the first two months of the year from December but still lagged growth for the whole of 2017.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, well below expectations of 2.6 percent and slowing from February's gain of 2.9 percent, due to seasonal declines in food, transport and tourism prices. 
""Despite the downward surprise for CPI, mostly due to a correction of food prices after the holiday, the overall economy remains robust,"" said Zhang Yi, a Beijing-based analyst with Capital Securities.
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI declined 1.1 percent, from a 1.2 percent rise in February. The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.0 percent in March, slowing from 2.5 percent in February. 
TRADE SPAT, WEAK PRICES 
While the tit-for-tat tariffs between China and the United States have fueled worries about the inflation outlook, few expect any strong upside pressure over the year.
""Due to changes in overseas economic environment and adjustment in domestic demand, prices will experience some fluctuations,"" the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Still there are foundations for prices to remain stable overall in the short term.""
A researcher from China's National Development and Reform Commission said this week that Beijing's proposed tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork will have limited impact on consumer price inflation.
Analysts are also still forecasting broad price pressures to ease as a slowdown in credit growth, led by Beijing's deleveraging campaign, is feeding through to an overall softening in economic activity.
China's central bank governor Yi Gang said last month he expected consumer inflation pressures to be mild this year, and that producer price increases will slow down. 
Nomura analysts said in a research note that a bounce in producer prices is possible in the second quarter. However, they expect the downtrend to resume thereafter ""due to the outlook of weakening investment demand, given a cooling property market and already high financing costs.""
Capital Economics' Evans-Pritchard is also forecasting weak PPI, possibly in deflation-mode by year-end. 

""The prospect of softening price pressures is one reason we expect the People's Bank to guide market interest rates lower this year in response to cooling economic activity.""

MANILA (Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank raised its 2018 economic growth estimate for developing Asia to 6.0 percent from 5.8 percent, citing solid export demand, but said U.S. protectionist measures and any retaliation against them could undermine trade.
Growth in developing Asia would only ease slightly to 5.9 percent in 2019, the bank said in its 2018 Asian Development Outlook released on Wednesday. Strong external and domestic demand helped economies in the region expand by an average 6.1 percent last year.
While protectionist trade measures by the United States so far this year have yet to dent trade flows to and from Asia, the risks are there, the Manila-based institution said.
""Further actions and retaliation against them could undermine the business and consumer optimism that underlies the regional outlook,"" the ADB said.
China has blamed the United States for trade frictions amid escalating threats of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two biggest economies, sparked by U.S. frustration with China's trade and intellectual property policies.
Another risk to Asia's growth, the ADB said, is ""diminishing capital inflows if the U.S. Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates faster than markets expect."" The Fed last raised rates in March and policymakers signaled two or three more hikes this year.
The ADB now expects China's economy to grow 6.6 percent this year, faster than the bank's prior estimate of 6.4 percent made in December, and by 6.4 percent in 2019.
China has set a growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, the same as last year, which it handily beat with an expansion of 6.9 percent.
China's growth will moderate ""as economic policy leans further toward financial stability and a more sustainable growth trajectory,"" ADB said.
By region, South Asia will remain the fastest growing in Asia Pacific, with the ADB pegging expansion this year at 7.0 percent and 7.2 percent in 2019. 
Despite growth easing to 6.6 percent in 2017, India's economy is projected to bounce back to 7.3 percent in 2018 and to 7.6 percent in 2019 as the country's new tax regime improves productivity, the ADB said.
Banking reform and corporate deleveraging are also taking hold, which could reverse a downtrend in investment, the bank said.

Growth in Southeast Asia is forecast at 5.2 percent for this year and next, the same pace as 2017, while Central Asia is projected to slow to 4 percent in 2018 before picking up to 4.2 percent next year.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 10:05PM ET</span>","Japan's February machinery orders beat expectations, wholesale prices slow","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose unexpectedly in February for a second consecutive month thanks to increased orders from manufacturers, a positive sign of corporate investment supporting economic growth.
Separate data out on Wednesday showed wholesale prices rose at a slower pace in February, painting a picture of an economy that is healthy enough to continue growing but not robust enough to generate the inflation the Bank of Japan needs to overcome the country's deflationary mindset.
The 2.1 percent increase in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a good indicator of capital spending in the next six to nine months, handily beat the gloomy median estimate for a 2.5 percent decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The Bank of Japan's tankan sentiment survey last week showed that mid-sized manufacturers planned to boost capital expenditure in the new fiscal year started on April 1, also suggesting business investment is likely to remain healthy.
However, worries about U.S. trade protectionism and potential gains in the yen versus the dollar pose risks to the outlook for Japan's capital expenditure.
""There's no change to my assessment that capital expenditure remains in an expansion phase, driven by the manufacturing sector,"" said Yusuke Ishikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy could potentially cause Japanese companies to stop investing, but so far this is not happening. Capex will continue to contribute to Japan's growth.""
Orders from manufacturers rose 8.0 percent in February, following a 9.9 percent increase in the previous month, due to an increase in orders from makers of steel and chemicals. 
Non-manufacturers' orders were unchanged in February as gains in orders from the telecommunications sector offset a decline in orders from the real estate, shipping, and finance industries. In January non-manufacturers' orders rose 4.4 percent. 
Core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, rose 2.4 percent from a year ago versus the median estimate for orders to remain unchanged.
The outlook is heavily clouded by the brewing trade war between the United States and China.The two economic superpowers have threatened each other with heavy tariffs amid growing U.S. disapproval of China's trade practices and its treatment of foreign intellectual property.
Japanese exporters would be unlikely to increase investment if China and the United States were to carry out their threats, with serious likely consequences for global trade and growth.

Wholesale prices in Japan rose 2.1 percent in the year to March, which was more than the median forecast for a 2.0 percent annual increase but still a slowdown from a revised 2.6 percent annual increase in February.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>","Healthcare, food boost U.S. producer prices in March","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in March, boosted by rising healthcare and food costs, pointing to a steady buildup of inflation pressures.
Most economists believe that strengthening inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates three more times this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs last month and forecast at least two more rate hikes in 2018. 
Producer prices have risen solidly since January, largely driven by the services components. Economists expect these increases to spill over into the consumer price index (CPI) and the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. 
""This pipeline price pressure will feed into consumer prices soon and will ultimately prompt the Fed to hike interest rates an additional three times this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index for final demand rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in February. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 3.0 percent from 2.8 percent in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the PPI would climb 0.1 percent last month and 2.9 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.4 percent last month, advancing by the same margin for a third straight month.
The so-called core PPI increased 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain since August 2014, after climbing 2.7 percent in February. 
U.S. Treasury prices fell on the inflation data while the dollar pared losses to trade marginally lower against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to cut import tariffs, easing investor concerns about rising U.S.-China trade tensions.
BROAD PRICE RISE
March's broad-based increase in wholesale prices supports views that inflation will pick up this year. 
Those expectations were boosted by a survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showing the share of small businesses planning to increase prices reaching its highest level since 2008 in March. 
The survey also showed the proportion of businesses raising wages to attract or retain workers was the largest in more than 17 years. 
A tightening labor market, a weak dollar and fiscal stimulus in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending are seen pushing inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target this year.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the PCE price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.6 percent in February after being stuck at 1.5 percent for four straight months. The Labor Department will publish March CPI data on Wednesday.
The price of services increased 0.3 percent in March, rising by the same margin for a third consecutive month. Services, which accounted for 70 percent of the increase in the PPI last month, were boosted by a 0.4 percent rise in the cost of outpatient care. 
Those costs feed into the core PCE price index. There were also increases in the cost of airline tickets, and cable and satellite subscriber services. 
But prices of wholesale apparel, footwear and wireless communications services fell last month.
Prices for goods rose 0.3 percent, after slipping 0.1 percent in February. They were lifted by a 2.2 percent jump in wholesale food prices. That was the biggest increase since April 2014 and followed three straight monthly declines. 
Wholesale food prices last month were driven by a surge in the cost of unprocessed fish, chicken eggs and fresh and dry vegetables. Gasoline prices dropped 3.7 percent after falling 1.6 percent in February.
""Some of these price pressures likely reflect stronger global growth in the first quarter and U.S. dollar weakness in the past 16 months,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The PPI is much more sensitive to both capacity constraints and the dollar than the CPI. Nevertheless, there is no denying the rising trend in wholesale costs.""
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased a bit less than initially estimated in February, but still suggested that inventory investment would contribute to economic growth in the first quarter after being a drag on output in the prior period.

Wholesale inventories rose 1.0 percent instead of the 1.1 percent jump it reported last month. That was the biggest increase since October 2013. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.9 percent in January.

Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) showed its index of business conditions fell 6 points to +14 in March, though that was still well above the long-run average of +5.5.
The survey's measure of profitability eased 4 points to +14 in March, while its sales index also slipped 4 to +20. Its often volatile measure of business confidence dipped 2 points to +7. 
The survey was conducted shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on at least $50 billion of imports from China, Australia's largest single export market.
NAB group chief economist Alan Oster noted the survey's measures of conditions were still equal to or above their long run averages for every industry sector.
""The strength in business conditions and leading indicators are consistent with stronger economic growth in coming quarters and the employment index is pointing to strong jobs growth which should reduce unemployment,"" said Oster.
The employment index eased to +9 in March, from an all-time peak of +16 the month before, but remained high historically.
The pullback in the survey's main measure will be a disappointment to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has repeatedly cited strength in business conditions as a reason for optimism on the economic outlook.

The survey also showed little inflationary pressure with retail prices edging lower in the three months to March and labor costs moderating.

Barclaycard, the credit and debit card division of  Barclays  (L:BARC), said annual consumer spending growth slowed to 2.0 percent in March from 3.8 percent in February, marking the weakest increase since April 2016. 
A Siberian weather system that meteorologists called ""the Beast from the East"" brought rare snow and sub-zero temperatures to much of Britain in late February and early March.
Business surveys last week showed the dominant services sector and the construction industry were hit badly by the poor weather, although manufacturers fared better. 
""The Beast from the East took its toll on the high street in March, keeping shoppers at home and leading to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said.
Separately, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said total retail sales values were up 2.3 percent in March compared with the same month a year ago, following a 1.6 percent year on year increase in February.
The growth reflected the fact that the Easter holiday sales took place in March this year rather than April like in 2017.
Retail sales values on a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in floorspace, rose 1.4 percent in March after a 0.6 percent rise in February.
""Seemingly endless cold weather dissuaded would-be shoppers from the high street and a number of retailers delivered bad news,"" said Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, which also sponsors the BRC report.
""Great hopes were placed on Easter trading, but whilst the latest figures point to overall improvement when compared to recent months, the Easter boost didn't quite measure up to previous years.""
Most economists think Bank of England officials are unlikely to be too concerned by any weakness in economic growth caused by the bad weather, as this should reverse in the coming months. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates in May.
The first estimate of economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 is due to be published on April 27.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The massive tax cuts signed into law in December, which Republicans said would pay for themselves, will balloon the U.S. deficit in years ahead, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday, possibly hobbling President Donald Trump's future agenda.
The deficit - the amount that Washington's spending exceeds its revenues - will expand to $804 billion in fiscal 2018, which ends on Sept. 30, up from $665 billion in fiscal 2017, CBO said.
The national debt is on track to approach 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028, said the nonpartisan CBO, which analyzes legislation for Congress.
""That amount is far greater than the debt in any year since just after World War II,"" CBO said, adding that the debt is now about 77 percent of GDP, a measure of the size of the economy. The Republican tax legislation, passed by Congress without Democratic support, along with a recent bipartisan $1.3 trillion spending package, are expected to drive economic growth faster than initially expected, CBO said.
Real GDP will grow by 3.3 percent in 2018; 2.4 percent in 2019; and 1.8 percent in 2020, it said.
But those growth rates will not offset the deficits, which will ""increase rapidly this year and over the next few years,"" then stabilize, resulting in a projected cumulative deficit of $11.7 trillion for 2018-2027, CBO forecast.
The analysis ""confirms that major damage was done"" by the new tax law and the spending bill, said Michael Peterson, head of the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation.
""This high and rising debt matters because it harms our economy,"" said Peterson, whose group backs fiscal conservatism.
""During a time of low unemployment and economic expansion, we should be taking reasonable steps to put our debt on a sustainable path – but instead we are piling up trillions of bills,"" he said.
The CBO's annual report on the U.S. budget and economy typically comes out in January but was delayed this year to allow it to assess effects of the tax overhaul and spending bill. The forecast does not take into account any economic impact of the trade dispute between the United States and China. 
MIDTERMS MESSAGING
In the near term, a rosier-than-expected economic outlook for individuals offered by the CBO could boost the Republican economic message as Trump's party seeks to retain control of Congress in the November midterm elections.
All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and about a third of the 100-member Senate's seats are being contested.
But, as deficits, inflation and interest rates rise, GDP growth will slow from 2020 to 2026, the CBO said. The expiration of lower individual tax rates at the end of 2025 will add to slowed economic growth then, the CBO added. 
House Republicans have said they will take up a measure to balance the budget, now that lawmakers have returned from a two-week recess. But such a measure has little chance of passing and the effort will largely be about political messaging.
In the coming months, Trump and fellow Republicans will need to find ways to pay for other parts of their political agenda, including a proposed infrastructure package and a wall that Trump wants to construct along the U.S.-Mexican border that could cost as much as $70 billion.
Trump called the $1.3 trillion spending measure last month a ""ridiculous situation"" and said he only signed it to protect defense spending.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the lower revenues and higher deficits resulting from the tax overhaul will prompt Republicans to call for cuts to social safety net programs such as the Social Security retirement program and the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly.

""The CBO's latest report exposes the scam behind the rosy rhetoric from Republicans that their tax bill would pay for itself,"" Schumer said in a statement.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - An escalation in U.S. sanctions against Moscow risks derailing a fragile recovery in Russia's economy, which had just begun to take hold after the Kremlin's last confrontation with the West in 2014, analysts and investors said on Monday.
The United States imposed major new sanctions against Russia on Friday, striking at senior Russian officials and some of the country's biggest companies in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity"".
""One gets the impression that since 2014 we have been convinced that sanctions are painless for our economy,"" said Kirill Tremasov, head of research at Loko-Invest and former director of the Russian Economy Ministry's forecasting department.
""This is completely groundless. What happened on Friday opens a new stage in relations with Western countries. We have found ourselves in a new reality. And it is very, very serious.""
Analysts and investors in Moscow said the sanctions could consign Russia to years of low growth, frustrating government efforts to stimulate a rebound from a two-year downturn brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.
Putin was re-elected for his fourth presidential term in March with a huge majority, but is under increasing pressure to meet voters' expectations of better growth and assuage concerns about falling living standards.
SLOW-GROWTH ENVIRONMENT
After two years of contraction, Russian GDP returned to growth of 1.5 percent last year on the back of higher oil prices, still short of a government target of 2 percent.
Chris Weafer, a senior partner at economic and political consultancy Macro Advisory, said he still saw Russia's economy growing by 1.8 percent this year, with oil prices above $60 a barrel.
""But the big question, of course, is 'How long does Russia stay in this low-growth environment?' That's where the impact of sanctions happens,"" he said.
""We all know that the economy needs to grow at a faster pace over the course of the next (presidential) term, it needs to get stronger - and sanctions and the impact on foreign direct investment, that's where it comes in,"" he said. ""2018 is the year of Russia in the doldrums.""
The latest round of U.S. sanctions represents the biggest escalation in Western action against Russia since Washington and the European Union first targeted oligarchs close to Putin and their businesses over the Ukraine crisis in 2014.
Investors said the inclusion of people who are not traditionally seen as part of Putin's inner circle showed that any Russian company or business leader could now be targeted.
Russia's rouble suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years on Monday and stocks in major Russian companies also slid, as investors reacted to the new sanctions. State-owned Sberbank, often seen as a barometer of the wider economy, fell 17 percent in Moscow and aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486) lost over half its value in Hong Kong after its main owner Oleg Deripaska was named on the sanctions list.
TIGHTER MONEY
The increased uncertainty and risk will make it harder for Russian companies to borrow abroad and reduce the amount of inward investment, said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management.
""Unless there is a move to de-escalation, you have to assume that financing conditions around Russia will get even tighter,"" he said. ""Long-term, that's going to be bad for growth and mean even more stagnation in the Russian economy.""
Natalia Orlova, head economist at Alfa Bank, said the central bank might now take more time over interest rate cuts that could boost growth: ""Based on economic logic ... it seems to me that it is dangerous to hurry with a rate cut in such uncertain conditions.""
Loko-Invest's Kirill Tremasov said the biggest danger of the new sanctions might be in scaring foreign investors off Russian OFZ treasury bonds, popular in the West because of their high yields. 
The yield on the benchmark 10-year OFZ rose as high as 7.32 percent on Monday as the price of the bond fell. It had stood at around 7.05 percent last week.
Foreigners' holdings of OFZ bonds stood at nearly $40 billion, or 33.9 percent of all OFZ bonds as of Feb. 1, the last period for which data was available.

""For foreign investors, this is a very, very serious signal ... and now there could be some OFZ outflows,"" Tremasov said. ""This will be reflected in the growth of interest rates in the economy.""

In monthly terms, prices rose by 1.5 percent in March from February, the fastest gain since August last year.
Both increases were stronger than forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
However, house prices are still rising much more slowly than before the 2016 referendum decision to take Britain out of the European Union which hit confidence among many households and their spending power as the pound's fall pushed up inflation. 
By Halifax's measure, prices were rising by about 10 percent a year shortly before the Brexit vote.
A shortage of homes for sale is expected to continue to shore up the market and Halifax said it expected price growth to remain close to 3 percent in the coming months.

Rival mortgage lender Nationwide has said its measure of house prices showed the smallest increase in seven months in March when they rose by an annual 2.1 percent.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports plunged unexpectedly in February, posting their biggest monthly drop in 2-1/2 years and narrowing the trade surplus, data showed on Monday, in a further sign that growth in Europe's biggest economy could have reached its peak.
Seasonally adjusted exports fell by 3.2 percent on the month, the steepest decline since August 2015, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Imports dropped by 1.3 percent.
A Reuters poll had pointed to exports edging up by 0.2 percent on the month and imports rising by 0.3 percent.
""As it looks, we have surpassed the top of the economic upswing,"" HSBC Trinkhaus analyst Lothar Hessler said, adding that the stronger euro was probably to blame for the weak export figures.
""The German economy will continue to grow, but with less momentum,"" Hessler said.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.2 billion euros ($23.6 billion) from 21.5 billion euros in January, the lowest since January 2017. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 21.4 billion euros.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, edged up to 20.7 billion euros from 20.3 billion euros in January, unadjusted data showed.
Andreas Scheuerle from DekaBank said the data pointed to an disappointing first quarter.
""It's hard to explain the reasons for this weak start to the year because the good economic conditions have not changed over the past three months,"" Scheuerle said, adding that record employment and rising wages were a good omen for domestic demand.
Scheuerle added that protectionist threats from U.S. President Donald Trump could hardly be the main reason for the February decline in German exports.
Still, the prospect of Germany getting caught in the cross-fire of a trade war between the United States and China is worrying German businesses.
The DIHK Chambers of Commerce and Industry said last week an escalation of the dispute over import duties could harm the global economy and weaken demand for German goods and services.
Official data last week showed German industrial output fell by the most in more than two years in February. The Economy Ministry said industry was losing momentum.
Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to visit U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday.
Merkel's trip, three days after French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the Washington, comes just before the expiry of an exemption for the European Union from U.S. import duties on steel and aluminum.
The visits give the EU leaders an opportunity to lobby for the bloc to be exempted permanently from the tariffs which are suspended for the EU until May 1.

As trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, other countries with trade surpluses against the U.S. are nervously wondering who President Donald Trump may target next. And Trump has already put Japan on notice for what he sees as taking advantage of the U.S.
While much of the current-account surplus is driven by Japan’s income from overseas -- including a significant chunk of investment in America, which Trump should welcome -- the trade surplus with the U.S. grew to a hefty 631 billion yen ($5.9 billion) in February. That’s up 3.4 percent from a year earlier amid strong exports of automobiles.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Brexit transition deal last month has boosted confidence among finance chiefs at some of the country's leading companies, a survey published on Monday showed.
Accountancy firm Deloitte said 27 percent of chief financial officers it interviewed after the deal was struck were more optimistic than three months earlier.
That compared with 18 percent of CFOs who were more optimistic before the deal was struck.
Prime Minister Theresa May and the rest of the EU's leaders agreed on March 19 to keep their existing trade ties unchanged for 21 months after Brexit in March 2019.
The deal pushed back the risk of disruption for companies until the end of 2020, although for the transition agreement to become effective London and Brussels must first agree on their long-term trade ties for the period after 2020.
Deloitte interviewed 106 CFOs from large British firms and major British subsidiaries of foreign companies between March 7 and March 21. About four-fifths of them responded before the transition deal was reached.
Risk appetite strengthened after the deal, with 23 percent of those responding after the deal was done saying it was a good time to take on risk, up from 12 percent beforehand.
The survey also showed corporate uncertainty was at a two-year low, although almost one in three CFOs said their firms still faced high or very high levels of uncertainty.
Britain's economy has slowed since the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU, due in part to weaker growth in investment spending by companies.
""Brexit remains a major concern for UK CFOs, though one which, in the wake of the announcement of the transition deal, is easing,"" David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe, said.
""Concerns about the dampening effect on corporate spending plans remain, but they have softened.""
Deloitte said for the first time in two years Brexit was not the top risk for CFOs, being replaced by weak domestic demand. 
However, much of that weakness in demand reflects the impact that the Brexit vote has had on spending by British households, who have faced higher inflation caused by the fall in the value of sterling. 

Sproul said business confidence would depend on progress in talks about Britain's new long-term trade ties to the EU.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 02:46PM ET</span>","U.S. job gains smallest in six months, wage growth firming","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in six months in March as a boost from milder temperatures faded, but a pickup in wage gains pointed to a tightening labor market, which should allow the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates this year.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 103,000 last month, with construction and retail sectors shedding jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the smallest gain since last September and followed a 326,000 surge in February, which was the largest in more than two years.
Temperatures returned to normal in March, with snowstorms in some parts of the country. The pullback in job gains is likely temporary as layoffs are at historic lows and other independent labor market indicators were strong in March.
""Inclement weather was the primary culprit for the slowdown in the pace of job growth in March,"" said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
Employment gains averaged 202,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, highlighting underlying labor market strength. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent for a sixth straight month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy adding 193,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate dropping to 4.0 percent.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching, and those working part time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.0 percent last month.
With labor market slack diminishing, wage growth picked up a bit in March. Average hourly earnings rose eight cents or 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February.
The gain lifted the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February. Annual wage growth is inching closer to the pace of at least 3 percent economists say is needed to lift inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago on Friday that lack of robust wage gains suggested the labor market was not ""excessively tight"" and that he would be ""looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further."" 
The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs last month and forecast two more interest rate hikes this year.
""In sum, no change in the Fed's trajectory,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""If anything, the wage data are beginning to strengthen the argument for three more hikes this year.""
The step-down in employment gains combined with mounting trade tensions between the United States and China to undercut stocks on Wall Street and the dollar.
Beijing warned on Friday it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"" of fresh trade measures if Washington followed through with President Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods. 
U.S. stocks tumbled, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 2.6 percent. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MODEST ACCELERATION FOR THE ECONOMY
Economists do not see an impact on hiring in the near term from the stock market selloff, which has caused a tightening in financial conditions.
While the weather dampened hiring last month, it did not have an impact on hours worked. The average workweek held at 34.5 hours. That together with the modest job gains and increase in average hourly earnings boosted a proxy for take-home pay.
""This morning's figures may suggest a little less momentum heading into the second quarter, but taken with other data, the continued expansion in total hours worked points to a modest acceleration in activity this quarter, provided we manage to avoid shooting ourselves in the foot on trade policy,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The economy appears to have slowed in the first quarter, with gross domestic product growth estimates mostly below a 2 percent annualized rate. Growth in the January-March period tends to be weak for seasonal reasons.
The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year is seen bolstered by a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package and increased government spending, which economists say will offset some of the impact from the stock market's gyrations.
The unemployment rate has hovered at 4.1 percent since October as people piled into the labor market. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.9 percent in March after rising to a five-month high of 63.0 percent in February.
The return of cold weather and a shortage of skilled workers weighed on hiring at construction sites in March. Payrolls in the sector fell 15,000, the first drop since last July, after surging 65,000 in February.
Manufacturing employment increased 22,000. The retail sector shed 4,400 jobs after adding 47,300 positions in February.
Temporary help, seen as a harbinger of future permanent hiring, slipped by 600. Leisure and hospitality employers added only 5,000 jobs last month, the least since September. Government payrolls rose by 1,000 in March.

The data was lower than the consensus estimate for the creation of 193,000 jobs and below the 241,000 positions that the ADP report indicated on Wednesday.
The previous month’s reading of NFP was revised to 326,000 from the 313,000 registered initially.
The jobless rate held steady at 4.1%, missing expectations for a further drop to 4.0%.
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.3% month-on-month in March, matching forecasts. That was higher than the 0.1% advance seen a month earlier.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation grew 2.7% in March, higher than the 2.6% gain seen in the previous month. March’s reading matched expectations.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer new job contracts than expected in March with a total of 102,000.
Analysts had forecast the creation of 190,000 new jobs.
February’s number was revised to an increase of 320,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 287,000 jobs in the private sector.
Government payrolls increased by 1,000 last month.
In February, 6,000 government jobs were created which was a downward revision from the initial reading of the creation of 26,000 public positions.

Ifo surveys some 7,000 firms each month to produce its business climate index, which fell for a second straight month in March and hit its lowest level in nearly a year, as managers became more concerned about the rising threat of protectionism.
Given the growing importance of the services sector in Germany, this would be included in the new methodology, the Ifo documents showed.

But that rebound was at risk from a strong yen and international trade friction that could erode businesses' confidence in economic growth and undermine their willingness to spend. 
Machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in six to nine months, were expected to slip 2.5 percent in February from January robust growth of 8.2 percent. 
The poll of 16 economists found that core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, were seen likely to be flat in February from a year earlier.
""Machinery orders have been range-bound,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, but ""they are expected to start picking up gradually thanks to the higher level of corporate earnings"". 
Analysts noted the need to scrutinize movements in the yen because the vigor of the Japanese economy would depend on global economic growth.
""If the yen's appreciation progresses and corporations become more cautious over the business outlook, machinery orders and capital spending may lose momentum,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Cabinet Office will announce the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on April 11 (2350 GMT April 10).
CORPORATE GOODS PRICES SEEN RISING 
The orders data will coincide with the Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services and is expected to have risen 2.0 percent in March versus a 2.5 percent rise in February.
The yen's appreciation and slowing price growth for oil- and coal-related products were seen capping gains in the CGPI index, analysts said.
The central bank will publish the CGPI at the same time as machinery orders on April 11.
Japan Is expected to post a 2.16 trillion yen ($20.14 billion) current account surplus in February, the poll found.
Income gains from overseas investments were expected to support Japan's current account surplus, but a slowdown in exports because of the Lunar New Year holidays would trim the surplus versus February last year, respondents said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth likely slowed in March as the boost from mild temperatures faded, but the gains were probably more than enough to push the unemployment rate down to 4.0 percent, indicating the labor market continues to tighten.
Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 193,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Payrolls surged 313,000 in February as unusually warm weather saw construction firms hire the most workers since 2007. Temperatures returned to normal in March, with some snowstorms.
""The shift from unseasonably warm weather in February to more seasonably normal temperatures in March will depress job growth, likely in construction, retail, and leisure and hospitality,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
March's anticipated job growth would be below the 242,000 average of the past three months. Still, it would be well above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
The unemployment rate is forecast to fall 1/10th of a percentage point to 4.0 percent, which would be the lowest level since December 2000 and the first drop in the jobless rate in six months. Despite signs of rapidly diminishing labor market slack, wage growth likely remained moderate in March.
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. The gain would lift the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February.
Wages remain the weakest link in the tight labor market.
Economists say annual wage growth of at least 3 percent is needed to lift inflation toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. There is hope that wage growth will accelerate in the second half of the year and allow the Fed to continue raising interest rates. 
The Fed increased borrowing costs last month and forecast two more interest rate hikes this year. Economists did not see an impact on hiring in the near-term from a recent stock market selloff, which has caused a tightening in financial conditions.
THE STOCK MARKET AND SPENDING
Financial markets were spooked by fears of a trade war after the United States and China engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs. Those concerns have eased somewhat as Washington signaled it is looking to resolve the trade dispute with Beijing.
""If equity prices keep going down, that's going to put a crimp in spending, both because it will discourage spending and reduce household wealth, but we are not there yet,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon AMNA in New York. ""Most of the wealth that got destroyed over the past month is really paper wealth.""
Despite the anticipated slowdown in job growth in March, the employment report is likely to underscore the economy's strong fundamentals, even as gross domestic product growth appears to have moderated in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2 percent annualized rate.
Growth in the January-March period tends to be weak because of a seasonal quirk. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the 2017 fourth quarter. Growth this year is seen boosted by a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package and increased government spending, which economists say will offset some of the impact from the stock market gyrations.
The unemployment rate has hovered at 4.1 percent since October as people piled into the labor market. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to a five-month high in February.
The return of cold weather and a shortage of skilled workers are expected to have slowed hiring at construction sites in March after payrolls in the sector surged 61,000 in February, the most since March 2007. 
""Construction payrolls will rise, but by much less than in February,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""Tight labor markets in the industry may make it more difficult to accommodate the normal spring ramp-up in headcounts.""
Further job gains are expected in manufacturing after payrolls increased by 31,000 jobs in February. A slowdown in retail employment growth is likely after the sector posted the biggest job gains in two years in February.

Government employment is forecast to have risen modestly.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 12:09PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit rises to near nine-and-a-half-year high in February,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, with both imports and exports rising to record highs in a sign of strong domestic and global demand.
News on Thursday of the worsening trade deficit came as the United States and China were embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs which escalated trade war fears and rattled financial markets.
President Donald Trump's administration is pursuing import duties to eradicate the deficit and protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition. But economists say the trade penalties will not reverse the deficit.
""The U.S. continues to expand faster than most other industrialized countries, so it should not surprise anyone that the trade deficit is worsening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.""Tariffs may sound like a good way to change the pattern of trade, but they tend to raise prices rather than modify the trade fundamentals.""
The Commerce Department said the trade gap increased 1.6 percent to $57.6 billion in February, the highest level since October 2008. The deficit has now increased for six straight months. Most of the rise in the trade deficit in February reflected commodity price increases.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $56.8 billion in February. The goods trade deficit was the highest since July 2008 and the surplus on services was the lowest since December 2012.
While the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell 18.6 percent to $29.3 billion in February, it has increased 20.2 percent so far this year.
The Trump administration on Tuesday targeted 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese industrial technology, transport and medical products, to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices. China swiftly retaliated on Wednesday with a list of similar duties on key American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals
Trump, who claims the United States is being taken advantage of by its trading partners, has already imposed broad tariffs on imported solar panels and large washing machines. He has also slapped 25 percent import duties on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
While these actions may prove politically popular with Trump's working class political base, especially in states hard-hit by factory closures and import competition, analysts warn they could undercut economic growth and raise prices for both consumers and producers.
The dollar rose to a two-week high against a currency basket amid signs the United States was looking to resolve the trade dispute with China. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
DEFICIT WILL WORSEN
The trade deficit is expected to widen further, thanks to an accommodative fiscal policy stance at a time when the economy is operating very close to full capacity. A $1.5 trillion income tax cut package came into effect in January and government spending will increase this year.
The economy's strong fundamentals were underscored by a report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing the number of Americans on unemployment benefits falling to its lowest level since December 1973 during the week ending March 24.
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit slipped to $69.11 billion from $69.96 billion in January. The so-called real trade deficit average for the first two months of 2018 is above the fourth-quarter average of $66.8 billion.
This suggests trade would subtract from first-quarter gross domestic product. Trade sliced 1.16 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent annualized rate during that period. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2 percent rate.
""We suspect widening trade deficits and resulting subtractions from GDP growth will be a persistent feature of GDP this year as domestic demand outpaces the economy's supply potential,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""Tariffs will do nothing to lessen this trade imbalance, unless there is a retaliatory escalation that leads to an economic downturn.""
In February, exports of goods increased 2.3 percent to $137.2 billion, boosted by shipments of crude oil, natural gas, motor vehicles, civilian aircraft, and drilling and oilfield equipment. Exports to China were unchanged in February.
Goods imports jumped 1.6 percent to $214.2 billion in February, lifted by food, civilian aircraft, computers and crude oil. Imports of services rose to a record $47.8 billion from $46.8 billion in January, boosted by royalties and broadcast license fees related to the Winter Olympics.

Imports from China declined 14.7 percent in February.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. Last week's increase likely reflected difficulties adjusting the data around moving holidays like Easter and school spring breaks.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.
The Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 228,250 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on March's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 193,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent.
Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will start boosting wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to support consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 64,000 to 1.81 million in the week ended March 24, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 13,500 to 1.85 million, the lowest reading since January 1974.

The four-week moving average rose by 3,000 to 282,250 last week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Thursday that retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose by just 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 1.8 percent year-on-year increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent monthly rise and a 2.1 percent annual gain.
Eurostat also cut its figures for January to -0.3 percent on the month and to 1.5 percent year-on-year from the previous estimates of -0.1 and 2.3 percent respectively.
Food, drink and tobacco sales grew after a month-on-month contraction and year-on-year stagnation in January.
Sales of pharmaceutical and medical goods and of automotive fuel rose during February after declines in January, but other non-food products either rose by less than in January or fell. 
These included clothing, electrical goods and furniture, computer equipment and books as well as mail order and internet sales.
Internet sales, which peaked in November, have now fallen for three straight months. 
Eurostat also released data on producer prices, showing a 0.1 percent month-on-month increase, in line with expectations, and a 1.6 percent year-on-year rise, just ahead of the average economist forecast of 1.5 percent.

LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Heavy snow and weak consumer demand weighed on British services last month, which grew at the slowest rate since just after the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, a major survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) tumbled to 51.7 in March from February's reading of 54.5, its lowest reading since July 2016 and a bigger fall than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Britain's construction PMI showed a similar drop on Wednesday, although manufacturing held up better.
Looking at the first three months of 2018 as a whole, the figures suggest the British economy grew at a quarterly rate of slightly less than 0.3 percent, down from an already-modest 0.4 percent at the end of 2017, IHS Markit said.
""The UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years,"" Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist.
A Siberian weather system that meteorologists called ""the Beast from the East"" brought snow and rare sub-zero temperatures to much of Britain in late February and early March.
Provisional PMI data for the euro zone have also undershot economists' forecasts due to the weather, but economists predict the bloc will outpace Britain again in the first quarter with growth of 0.5 percent.
IHS Markit said British services reported weak consumer demand as well as concern about the country's departure from the EU in a year's time as being behind the weakest growth in new orders since July 2016.
Broader business sentiment fell to its joint-lowest level since July 2016.
However, the weak British figures are unlikely to dissuade the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month for only the second time since the global financial crisis.
The BoE said last month that while the snow was likely to cause first-quarter economic growth to slow to 0.3 percent, ""an ongoing tightening of monetary policy"" would be needed to bring above-target inflation back to its 2 percent target. 
High inflation caused by the pound's fall after the Brexit vote has sapped consumer demand over the past year, and British growth has slowed to be the weakest of any major economy at a time of a global upturn.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.8 points last month, up 1.1 percent from February.
From a year earlier, food prices on international markets rose 0.7 percent in March, FAO said.
""Declines in price quotations for sugar and most vegetable oils were more than offset by increases for maize, wheat and most dairy products,"" FAO said in a statement.
FAO said global cereals output in 2017 was 2.646 billion tons, up 33 million tons from 2016, but it expected maize and wheat production to decline in 2018 based on early forecasts. 

The agency predicted wheat output of 750 million tons for 2018, about 1 percent lower than the near-record 2017 level.

312,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",UK Services PMI Slows Sharply in March,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK service sector rose at the slowest pace in more than one-and-a-half years last month, according to a closely watched business survey released on Wednesday.
Disruption due to snow and unusually bad weather conditions had been a key factor holding back business activity growth, the report said.
Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.7 in March, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.9.
The index had picked up to a four month high of 54.5 in February after the weakest start to the year in nearly a decade.
Services account for around 80% of the UK’s gross domestic product.
New order growth was the slowest in 20 months as the triple force of snow, inflation and Brexit-related uncertainty hit output in the service sector.
The report indicated that inflationary pressures picked up again in March, suggesting that consumer price inflation could remain stubbornly high in coming months.
Employment numbers increased at only a moderate pace in March, with the rate of job creation the slowest seen so far this year.
A similar report earlier in the week showed that while manufacturing activity inched higher in March output in the sector slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year.
Another report showed that activity in the UK construction sector slowed sharply last month due to severe weather disruption.
Taken together, the reports indicate that first quarter growth is likely to have been hit by widespread disruptions caused by unusually bad weather.
“The UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler Markit.
“As a result, first quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected. The PMI surveys collectively signal a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter, albeit with the rate of growth sliding to just 0.15% in March alone.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Heavy snow slowed activity in Europe's dominant service industry last month but with growth still relatively strong, policy expectations for the European Central Bank and Bank of England are unlikely to change.
Businesses across the euro zone ended the first quarter with their weakest expansion since the start of 2017 as bad weather and a strong currency combined to curb growth in new orders, a business survey showed on Thursday. [EUR/PMIS]
It was a similar story in Britain, where a sister survey said the Siberian weather system meteorologists called ""the Beast from the East"" weighed on services, which expanded at the slowest rate since just after the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. [GB/PMIS]
Survey compiler IHS Markit said the PMIs pointed to a solid first quarter growth rate of 0.6 percent in the euro zone, but only half that in Britain, which is due to leave the EU in just under a year's time.
But the ECB will probably decide this summer to slash its bond purchases if things develop as expected, policymaker Ewald Nowotny said last week. The BoE is widely expected to raise interest rates next month for only the second time since the global financial crisis a decade ago. [ECILT/GB]
""The ECB is pretty much set on its course anyway. The Bank of England is a little more interesting in the sense that the rate decision is a bit more imminent,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""But the general perception is that this all appears to be more of a weather-related effect and as a consequence we can look through.""
The BoE sees British inflation as running too high. Even though it is below target in the euro zone, the ECB is looking to wind down its huge stimulus program in coming months.
Euro zone inflation rose to 1.4 percent as anticipated last month, preliminary official data showed on Wednesday, still some distance from the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.
In Britain, where sterling's fall since the Brexit vote has driven inflation up, prices rose a slower than expected 2.7 percent annually in February - though considerably above the central bank's 2 percent target.
The BoE kept interest rates steady last month but two policymakers unexpectedly voted for a hike, reinforcing the view among economists that borrowing costs will rise in May.
PMIS SLIP ON THE ICE
IHS Markit's euro zone Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall indicator of growth, fell to 55.2 in March from February's 57.1, and revised down slightly from the flash estimate of 55.3.
That was the sharpest one-month drop in almost six years, but it remains well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Although growth remained strong and broad-based - with output expanding in every country covered by the survey - signs of a slowdown were also widespread, with growth in the bloc's big four economies as well as Ireland all moderating.
IHS Markit/CIPS British services PMI tumbled to 51.7 in March from February's reading of 54.5, its lowest reading since July 2016 and a bigger fall than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Reports earlier this week showed Britain's construction PMI dropped sharply in March, although manufacturing held up better.
""At face value, the latest UK services PMI looks very concerning ... but it seems that 'the Beast from the East' played a big role in this miss,"" noted James Smith at ING.
""In reality, this means that policymakers will likely choose to look through this latest data when they meet next in May.""
Reuters polls last month predicted economic expansion of 0.6 percent in the euro zone and 0.4 percent in Britain. In January, the bloc's PMI was at its highest since June 2006 but the Reuters poll said growth had already peaked. [ECILT/EU]
The euro (EUR=) has gained over 2 percent against the dollar in the last three months, making the bloc's exports more expensive, while several blasts of cold weather in Europe have also hit activity.
""We are seeing some weakness in the domestic economy as well; notably some of the German numbers have been a bit softer of late. At the margin, the stronger euro is not helping,"" Commerzbank's Dixon said.
A sub-index measuring new orders, which includes trade within the euro area, fell to a 14-month low of 55.0 from 56.3.
Mirroring a slump in the manufacturing PMI released on Tuesday, the index covering the bloc's dominant service industry declined to a seven-month low of 54.9 from 56.2, just shy of the 55.0 flash reading. [EUR/PMIM]

314,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",German industrial orders rise less than expected in February,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose less than expected in February due to weak domestic demand, data showed on Thursday, but the economy ministry said demand should pick up later this year as the world economy remains on a growth path.
Contracts for ""Made in Germany"" goods rose by 0.3 percent after falling by an upwardly revised 3.5 percent in January, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
The reading undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a 1.5 percent increase.
""Despite the subdued demand so far this year orders should remain on an upward course,"" the economy ministry said in a statement. ""The global economy remains in upswing which should keep demand for German industrial goods on a high level.""
But the DIHK Chambers of Commerce and Industry struck a cautionary tone, saying that an escalation of a dispute between China and the United States over import duties could harm the global economy and dampen demand for German goods and services.
""The future development of orders largely depends on how the trade dispute develops,"" said Sophia Krietenbrink of the DIHK. ""The U.S. is the most important market for German companies and China is the third most important market. Should growth in both countries slow down this could harm German companies.""
A breakdown of the data showed that domestic demand fell by 1.4 percent. Foreign orders rose by the same amount and a 4.5 percent hike in demand from the euro zone offset a 0.6 percent fall in orders from outside the single currency bloc.
'ZENITH REACHED'
Private consumption has been a key growth driver in recent years as consumers benefit from rising wages, record-high employment and strong job security but foreign trade propelled Germany's fourth-quarter expansion of 0.6 percent.
The manufacturing sector is brimming and remains a solid pillar in an economy seen as an export champion.
The statistics office said last month that German manufacturers are sitting on orders that will take them nearly six months to complete, cushioning them against future shocks resulting from a worsening trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.
The data showed that the manufacturers' so-called 'order range' was 5.5 months in January, meaning they could carry on producing for nearly half a year even if they received no new orders.
Alexander Krueger of Bankhaus Lampe said that weaker demand is not necessarily bad news given that manufacturers have hit full capacity and can't meet higher demands.

""Capacities are fully stretched and time is needed to process orders,"" he said in a note. ""The growth zenith has been reached.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, pointing to a robust labor market that continues to underpin economic growth.
Labor market momentum was also underscored by a report on Wednesday showing sturdy gains in employment in the services industries last month even though a sharp drop in new orders restrained growth in the sector.
The reports supported economists' expectations of strong job growth in March. The Labor Department will publish its closely watched employment report on Friday.
""It points to a labor market still in exceptionally good health,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 241,000 jobs in March after rising 246,000 in February. Last month's increase beat economists' expectations for a 205,000 gain. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics. It said construction companies hired 31,000 workers last month and manufacturers added 29,000 jobs to their payrolls. Employment in the services sector increased by 176,000 jobs.
That was corroborated by the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) non-manufacturing survey, which showed the ISM's employment sub-index rising to a reading of 56.6 in March from 55.0 in February. 
The increase in services industry employment came despite the ISM non-manufacturing index falling 0.7 point to a reading of 58.8 as a measure of new orders fell 5.3 points. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
While the ADP report is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the government's more comprehensive employment report, it nonetheless left economists confident of their forecasts for solid job gains in March.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs after surging 313,000 in February. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent in March.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors fretted over escalating trade tensions between the United States and China after the world's two biggest economies announced against each other tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods. 
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled in morning trade before recouping losses early in the afternoon. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
TARIFF SPAT
The tariff spat is starting to impact some businesses. The ISM survey quoted respondents in the construction industry as complaining about price volatility because of the tariffs. 
According to the construction firms, ""accurate, long-term planning has become incredibly difficult, as distributors that historically held costs for at least 30 days are now, in some cases, committing to only seven days, as prices can change drastically in that time."" 
Similar views were echoed in the ISM's survey of manufacturers, published on Monday. 
Manufacturers reported that tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by President Donald Trump in early March were raising prices, ""causing panic buying"" and ""leading to inventory shortages for non-contract customers."" 
Before the tariffs manufacturing, which account for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, was on a solid footing, thanks to strong domestic and global demand. But the tariffs, a shortage of skilled workers and capacity constraints could slow momentum.
In a third report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said factory goods orders increased 1.2 percent in February amid strong demand for transportation equipment and a range of other products, nearly unwinding January's 1.3 percent decline. Orders surged 7.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in February. 
The department revised February orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, to show them rising 1.4 percent instead of the 1.8 percent jump reported last month.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods fell 0.3 percent in January. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.4 percent in February as reported last month.

""While a trade war could devastate the economy, conditions right now are quite good,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Factory goods orders increased 1.2 percent, nearly unwinding January's revised 1.3 percent decline, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 1.7 percent in February after a previously reported 1.4 percent drop in January. Orders surged 7.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in February.
Orders for transportation equipment soared 7.0 percent, lifted by a 26.2 percent jump in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. There were also increases in orders for machinery, which rose 1.2 percent after slipping 0.2 percent in January.
Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery climbed 1.8 percent. Orders for motor vehicles shot up 1.5 percent. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components surged 3.4 percent while bookings for computers vaulted 3.5 percent.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity is being supported by strong domestic and global demand, but a shortage of skilled workers and capacity constraints could hurt factory output.
A survey on Monday showed a slight ebb in sentiment among manufacturers amid rising concerns over labor shortages and the supply chain. Manufacturers also reported that tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by President Donald Trump in early March were raising prices, ""causing panic buying"" and ""leading to inventory shortages for non-contract customers.""
Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries.
The Commerce Department revised February orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, to show them rising 1.4 percent instead of the 1.8 percent jump reported last month.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods fell 0.3 percent in January. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.4 percent in February as reported last month.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - An early Easter helped drive a pick-up in euro zone inflation in March, keeping the European Central Bank on track with preparations to wind down its huge stimulus program in coming months.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 1.4 percent year-on-year, European Union statistics office Eurostat estimated on Wednesday - in line with market expectations and up from 1.1 percent in February. 
That also put the pace of price rises on a par with the full-year forecast outlined by the ECB, where a debate is in full swing on how and when to end the 2.55 trillion euro purchase scheme it launched in 2015 to fight off the threat of deflation.
The March rise, to the fastest pace of inflation so far this year, was partly due to an earlier Easter pushing up the price of package holidays and accommodation, a rise in the indicator's services component to 1.5 percent suggested. 
While inflation remains short of the ECB's target of near 2 percent, several policymakers now see it as robust enough to start winding down the purchase program. 
""This year's low point of the inflation rate is behind us,"" Alexander Krueger, an economist at Germany's Bankhaus Lampe, said.
""The foreseeable further increase in the inflation rate should encourage the ECB to slow down its asset purchases from October onwards and to end them in December.""
Two ECB policymakers, Klaas Knot and Ewald Nowotny, said last week the risk for the central bank was to move too slowly in withdrawing its extraordinary stimulus measures. 
The ECB's favored core inflation measure, which strips out volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year in March from 1.2 percent in February, also as expected.
However, another core gauge that many economists look at, excluding also alcohol and tobacco, held at 1.0 percent.
""With core inflation unchanged at a low level, the Bank will continue to stress its patient and persistent approach to monetary policy normalization,"" Jessica Hinds, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
Separately on Wednesday, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone fell to a nine-year low of 8.5 percent in February, from 8.6 percent in January.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index rose by 1.4% in March from the same month a year earlier, up from 1.1% in February and in line with forecasts.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, rose by an annual rate of 1.0%, unchanged from the previous month. Economists had expected core inflation to tick up to 1.1%.
Both measures are below the European Central Bank’s inflation target of close to but just under 2%.
Sluggish price growth highlights the challenges faced by the ECB as it debates how quickly to wind up its bond purchasing stimulus program after years of accommodative monetary policy.
The ECB dropped a pledge to expand its monetary easing program at its March meeting, indicating that stimulus in the region could come to an end in the near future.
The solid economic recovery in the euro zone supported the decision to remove the easing bias, the ECB said.
But stronger growth is not translating into a sustained increase in inflation, underlining the ECB’s caution in removing stimulus.
At the same time, a separate report by Eurostat showed that the unemployment rate in the euro area ticked down to a new nine-year low of 8.5% in February from 8.6% in January."

Research firm Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 47.0 in March, compared to forecasts for a reading of 50.9.
The prior month’s reading was 51.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit indicated that snow disruption contributed to what was the fastest drop in construction activity since July 2016.
The research firm further highlighted that civil engineering work declined at the sharpest pace in five years while input cost inflation moderated to a 20-month low.
“The construction sector continued to experience subdued business conditions during March, but snow-related disruption was a key factor behind the marked decline in activity on site reported by survey respondents,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
Moore also added that a solid rise in employment numbers and the rebound in business expectations to a nine-month high provided an indication that construction activity will strengthen over the near-term.
“However, survey respondents noted that underlying demand remains constrained by heightened economic uncertainty and risk aversion among clients,” Moore warned."
323,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",China's home prices expected to rise in 2018 on falling inventories: Reuters poll,"By Yawen Chen and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices are expected to rise faster this year than previously thought thanks to tight supply and government policies that promote smaller cities seeking to lure first-time buyers and upgraders, a Reuters poll showed. 
But price growth is still expected to be relatively muted - well below the gains made in 2017 - as rising borrowing costs and other curbs are likely restrain the market and pressure developers to accelerate project launches to raise cash.
China's housing market has enjoyed a more-than-two-year boom, giving a major boost to the economy but also fanning fears of bubbles, prompting authorities to impose measures to stem speculation since 2016. 
While more than 100 cities have introduced measures to cool prices, policymakers have been careful not to tap the brakes too hard as real estate has been a major contributor to economic growth.
China aims to pursue ""stable and healthy development"" of the property market in 2018, protecting the interests of first-time buyers and upgraders while taming speculation, Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report to the annual meeting of parliament in March. 
Nationwide, new home prices on average are expected to increase 1.0 percent for the whole year, after rising a median 2.5 percent in the first six months from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll that surveyed 13 property analysts and economists from March 23 to 30.
""Judging by the government's macro-prudential policies, prices in the biggest tier-1 and tier-2 cities will remain stable or even tread lower, but it is likely that the rest of China will still enjoy moderate price gains,"" said Emily Cao, head of research at Colliers International in Beijing. 
A Reuters poll conducted in December found prices were expected to increase a median 2 percent in the first half of 2018 and flatline by end-2018 .
New home prices in 2017 still crept up 5.3 percent from a year earlier, with sales by floor area picking up 7.7 percent, largely driven by a buying frenzy that has spread from the big metropolises to less-regulated smaller centers.
While many expect tightening measures to be gradually extended to smaller cities at risk of overheating, China's drive to get rid of shanty towns - offering money and resettlement to squatters - may continue to counter cooling demand this year. 
Falling inventories after more than two years of strong sales and a constant supply shortage in China's most populous cities, as well as government price caps, also suggest limited room for prices to fall further, despite the stiff curbs in those markets.
""From what we've seen so far, inventories in most of the cities remain pretty tight,"" Dongxing Securities analysts wrote.Inventories in 75 major cities monitored by E-house China R&D Institute fell in March from a year earlier, its latest report showed. 
""Land supply in top-tier cities is still hardly catching up with buyer demand,"" wrote analysts at Hwabao Trust.
Only two of the 13 analysts polled by Reuters expected an actual price fall in 2018. Property investment is estimated to grow 5 percent in the full year of 2018, unchanged from the last poll. 
LIQUIDITY RISKS
Most analysts polled by Reuters believe Beijing's crackdown on illegal financing to the property sector is set to intensify this year, and developers in general will face more liquidity pressure as sales cool further and borrowing costs rise.
In an effort to fend off financial risks, Beijing tightened monetary conditions in 2017 to tackle a growing debt pile, and closed off many gray channels for highly-leveraged developers to raise debt. 
That will also pose what is seen as one of the biggest risks to China's real estate market - bankruptcies of small and medium-sized developers that could disrupt markets.
But economists don't expect any immediate danger, as bigger industry players such as Country Garden are flush with cash thanks to record sales in 2017, putting them in a strong position to undertake market consolidation. 
Higher borrowing costs also pose a risk for the sector as they will potentially dampen demand, although mortgage rates remain low compared to historic levels, analysts say. 
The average mortgage rates for first-time home buyers edged up to 5.46 percent in February from a year earlier, while it was 5.79 percent for buyers of multiple properties or homeowners buying a new home, according to Rong360.com, a loan provider that tracks bank lending rates.
Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6, easing from analysts' estimates of 7 in the last poll.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>","China March services growth eases to four-month low, confidence dips: Caixin PMI","BEIJING, April 4 (Reuters) - China's services sector growth eased to a four-month low in March as new business and employment grew at a slower rate, a private business survey showed, pointing to cooling demand in a sector Beijing is counting on to maintain economic growth. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 52.3 in March, from February's 54.2, the weakest since November. However, it still remained above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. 
The lackluster survey results were in line with a separate survey by Caixin on Monday that showed activity in the manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest pace in four months.
The softness in the Caixin manufacturing PMI is raising concerns of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, although the private gauge was in contrast with the government's version, which was stronger than expected.
The two reports often diverge, possibly due to differences in the number and type of businesses surveyed. 
The Caixin services PMI, which tends to focus on smaller firms, suggested growth in new businesses eased to a five-month low in March as some firms cited greater market competition and a drop in customer numbers, while new hires increased at the slowest pace in 19 months.
A report by Chinese jobs website Zhaopin showed competition among white-collar workers for jobs intensified in the spring. The increase in job seekers versus jobs resulted in a drop in average monthly salaries for the first time since the second quarter of 2017, to 7,629 yuan ($1,213). That was a 2.1 percent decline from the previous quarter.
Hurt by weakening demand, sentiment towards the 12-month outlook for business activity eased to a six-month low in March, with concerns over exchange-rate fluctuations and subdued growth in tourism weighing on overall confidence at the end of the first quarter. 
However, input price inflation eased for a second straight month to a four-month low, while firms raised their prices charged at a slightly quicker pace than the previous month, suggesting higher profitability.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of softer growth, falling also to a four-month low of 51.8 in March, from the previous month's 53.3.
""Overall, the growth momentum of the Chinese economy weakened in March,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.
Economic data so far this year suggests the Chinese economy's solid growth momentum of last year has carried over into the first quarter, with a government think tank forecasting gross domestic product will grow 6.9 percent in the first half.

While strength in China's economy will help underpin global growth, economists are sticking to forecasts that momentum will slow later this year due to a cooling property market and rising borrowing costs.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 50.9 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis from 51.7 in February.
It was the lowest reading since October 2016, although the index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 18th consecutive month.
""Despite PMI data signaling disappointing output and demand conditions, prospects appear upbeat,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Incoming new business has grown for 20 successive survey periods, and firms expect this trend to continue, as indicated by a solid degree of optimism towards future activity.""
The index for new business eased to 51.0 from 51.9 in February, though future business expectations fell only a touch with overall optimism levels remaining robust. 
The reading for employment also rose as companies hired more workers.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 51.3 from 52.2 in February.
Japan's economy has expanded for eight consecutive quarters, the longest uninterrupted streak since a 12-quarter run of growth during the mid-to-late 1980s boom.

A final reading on a separate manufacturing survey also showed some modest loss of momentum in the factory sector, suggesting the pace of economic growth could slow over the year if consumer spending ebbs.

Shop prices fell 1.0 percent year-on-year in March, marking the fastest rate of deflation since February 2017 and following a 0.8 percent decline in February this year, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
Britain's economy slowed in 2017 as higher inflation - caused by the pound's drop after the 2016 Brexit vote - squeezed household spending.
""As the impact of the pound's depreciation one year on are beginning to fizzle out, retailers are passing the positive impact through to the shop floor,"" Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said.
Renewed signs of cooling cost pressures will be of interest to Bank of England officials, who last month said ""ongoing tightening"" of monetary policy would be needed to return inflation back to target.
Data last month showed consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in February, less than expected by investors.
Nonetheless, most economists think the BoE is still poised to raise interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis at its May policy meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's buoyant manufacturing industry lost some steam in the first three months of 2018, according to a survey on Tuesday that suggested the economy remains on a slow but steady course a year ahead of Brexit. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 55.1 in March from a downwardly revised 55.0 in February, beating the 54.7 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
But January's reading was also revised lower and for the first quarter as a whole, the PMI was its lowest in a year, though above its average since Britain exited recession in the third quarter of 2009 following the financial crisis. 
This suggested factory output rose at a quarterly rate of about 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent, slowing from 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, IHS Markit said.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of Britain's economy, was a relative bright spot late last year, when economic growth was the weakest among the Group of Seven rich nations. 
The slowdown was due in large part to weaker consumer demand caused by higher inflation after June 2016's Brexit vote knocked sterling lower.
A PMI published earlier on Tuesday showed growth in euro zone manufacturers slid to an eight-month low in March, although they continued to outpace their British peers. [EUR/PMIM]
Sterling and British government bonds were little moved by the figures.
""Despite the resilient March performance, the overall impression is that the manufacturing sector had a decent first quarter but has lost some momentum compared to the strong performance seen through the second half of 2017,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
At 55.1, the British factory PMI remains comfortably above its post-financial crisis average of 53.4.
""The outlook for manufacturing looks decent on the foreign demand side, but domestic conditions could prove challenging over the coming months,"" Archer said.
The PMI's new business index hit a nine-month low in March, marked by a tailing-off in growth in export orders -- possibly reflecting sterling's recent rally.
The pound has gained more than 4 percent against the U.S. dollar since the end of 2017.
A Confederation of British Industry survey last month also suggested growth in manufacturing moderated recently.
Tuesday's PMI showed growth in cost pressures for factories and their selling prices cooled in March, something that may reassure Bank of England officials who are keeping an eye on inflation pressures.
Most economists polled by Reuters think the central bank will raise interest rates to a post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent in May.
""With cost inflationary pressures also moderating to provide some respite for margins, the sector looks set to make further slow and steady progress as we head through the spring,"" Rob Dobson, director at PMI compiler IHS Markit, said.
PMIs covering the construction and services sectors are due on Wednesday and Thursday.

328,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",UK Manufacturing PMI rises to 55.1 in March,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK manufacturing sector accelerated last month, according to a closely watched business survey released on Tuesday.
Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.1 in March, compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.8.
The prior month’s reading was 55.0.
IHS Markit highlighted that output growth picked up, but was offset by slower increases in both new orders and employment.
On the price front, rates of inflation in input costs and output charges remained elevated despite easing slightly since February, it added.
“The latest PMI survey provided further evidence that UK manufacturing has entered a softer growth phase so far this year,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
Dobson indicated that the data was consistent with only a 0.4% to 0.5% gain in production volumes for the first quarter. “A considerable slide from the fourth quarter’s 1.3% increase,” he noted.
Despite the slowdown, this expert said there was generally positive news on whether growth will be sustained. He said that manufacturers were still reporting solid inflows of new work from both at home and abroad, while business optimism held steady at an elevated level.
“With cost inflationary pressures also moderating to provide some respite for margins, the sector looks set to make further slow and steady progress as we head through the spring,” Dobson concluded."

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's manufacturing boom stumbled in March as optimism waned and demand ebbed owing to a powerful winter storm, surveys showed on Tuesday, but expansion was still broad-based across the continent.
Factories in the currency bloc ended 2017 with record strong growth, so any slowdown from that pace is unlikely to stop decision-makers at the European Central Bank moving away from their ultra-easy policy stance.

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone sank to an eight-month low of 56.6 in March from 58.6, in line with an earlier flash estimate and still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday which is seen as good guide to economic health, fell to a 16-month low of 55.9 from 59.6, a little below its flash estimate.
Euro zone economic growth has already peaked, a Reuters poll found last month, but the ECB will probably decide this summer to slash its bond purchases if things develop as expected, policymaker Ewald Nowotny said last week. [ECILT/EU] 
""Clearly, the big question remains what the PMI will do next: the level is still good but the trajectory needs to stabilize in April,"" said Greg Fuzesi at JP Morgan.
Britain's PMI inched up to 55.1 in March from a downwardly revised 55.0 in February, beating the 54.7 consensus in a Reuters poll of economists.
""March's heavy snowfall doesn't appear to have had a particularly severe impact on supply chains,"" noted Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics.
""However, on the basis of past form, the output index still points to a slowdown in manufacturing growth to around 0.5 percent in Q1, well below the 1 percent plus rates seen at the end of last year.""
A Siberian weather system British forecasters dubbed the ""Beast from the East"" brought snow, strong winds and the coldest temperatures for years to many regions.
Earlier sister surveys showed although growth slowed in the currency union's four biggest economies it still stayed strong.
Yet factories were at their least optimistic since the end of 2016 and demand for products was at its weakest in 16 months.
Some of that fall in demand may have been due to manufacturers increasing prices again while a strong euro probably played a part in making the bloc's exports less attractive.
In February, factories had raised prices at their fastest pace in nearly seven years. An index measuring output prices remained high at 57.3 in March, down from 58.4 a month before.

Inflation was 1.4 percent last month, official flash estimates due on Wednesday are expected to show according to a Reuters poll, still well below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.

330,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:13AM ET</span>","Australia's central bank sits tight in ""masterful"" inaction","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates at record lows on Tuesday, the longest stretch without a change in almost three decades, and looked set to extend this period of ""masterful inaction"" for some time yet.
As widely expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its April policy meeting with the benchmark rate at 1.5 percent, where it has been since a cut in August 2016. The run of 20 months without a move is the longest since the cash rate was first introduced in 1990.
""Inflation is likely to remain low for some time, reflecting low growth in labor costs and strong competition in retailing,"" said RBA Governor Philip Lowe in a brief statement.
""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.""
Lowe has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank's board sees no strong case for a near term hike in rates, exhibiting the policy patience his predecessor liked to call 'masterful inaction.'
Investors have taken the message to heart and steadily widened the odds on a rate rise for the remainder of the year. Futures imply just a one-in-three chance of a hike by December, and are not fully priced for a move to 1.75 percent until August next year.
A Reuters poll of 45 analysts taken last week found around half expected a rise late this year, with the rest tipping a prolonged pause to 2019. 
Key to this patience has been the failure of workers to get pay rises despite a booming jobs market. Annual wage growth is only just above record lows at 2.1 percent and the RBA has conceded any pick up will come at a snail's pace.
Globalization, fierce retail competition, the long decline of trade unions and the increasing concentration of power among a small number of firms have all been blamed for what is a worldwide waning in wages growth. 
HOUSING COOLS
There is also plenty of slack left in the Australian labor force, particularly as more women go looking for work.
""Spare capacity is reducing only gradually indicating that wage growth is likely to remain muted for some time yet,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics, David Plank.
ANZ on Tuesday released a monthly survey showing job ads were flat in March after a dip the month before, hinting at some cooling in labor demand.
All of which is restraining incomes at a time when households are trying to manage record amounts of mortgage debt, so eating into spending power.
Consumers could once count on ever-rising home prices to buffer their wealth. The government estimates Australia's housing stock is worth a heady A$6.9 trillion ($5.29 trillion) - four times the size of annual gross domestic product.
But efforts by regulators to clamp down on risky mortgage lending have taken much of the heat out of that market, with prices going backward in Sydney and Melbourne last month.
Property consultant CoreLogic estimates annual price growth across the major cities braked to just 0.8 percent in March, from a top of 10.5 percent in the middle of 2017.

""A cooling housing market is one more reason, alongside slow wages growth and inflation, for the RBA to keep the cash rate on hold,"" said Kristina Clifton, a senior economist at CBA.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","U.S. factory activity slows, manufacturers worry about tariffs","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed in March amid shortages of skilled workers and rising capacity constraints, but growth in the manufacturing sector remains underpinned by strong domestic and global economies.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Monday also showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries among manufacturers about the impact of steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last month to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries.
""Demand remains robust, but the nation's employment resources and supply chains are still struggling to keep up,"" said Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's manufacturing business survey committee. 
The ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 59.3 last month from 60.8 in February. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The survey's prices index jumped to its highest level since April 2011. There were price increases across 17 of 18 industry sectors last month. While a measure of new orders dropped, a gauge of backlog orders rose to levels last seen in May 2004.
The survey's customers' inventories index was at its lowest level since July 2011. A measure of factory employment dropped last month and the ISM said there were indications that labor and skill shortages were affecting production.
Seventeen industries including fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, machinery, and chemical products reported growth last month. Apparel, leather and allied products was the only industry reporting a decrease.
EYES ON TARIFFS
Machinery manufacturers said the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports were ""causing panic buying, driving the near-term prices higher and leading to inventory shortages for non-contract customers."" 
Manufacturers of miscellaneous products reported that ""new tariffs are causing concern across the supply chain. Full impact will take a few weeks to reveal itself."" Primary metal producers reported ""significant price increases in the steel commodity"" as a result of the tariffs.
Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum in early March. Fiore said 42 percent of survey comments in March were related to prices and tariffs. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors worrying about a global trade war after China increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 American products in response to the duties on aluminum and steel imports.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading sharply lower and the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. government bond prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to a near two-month low.
Still, the outlook for manufacturing remains upbeat amid dollar weakness, which is boosting the competitiveness of American-made goods on the international market.
""The near-term prospects for the manufacturing sector and the broader economy still appear brighter than they have been at any point over the past five years,"" said Michael Pearce, an economist at Capital Economics in New York.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in February after being unchanged in January. February's marginal increase in construction spending supports economists’ expectations for a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the January-March quarter are mostly below a 2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Construction spending in February was held back by a 2.1 percent drop in outlays on public construction projects, which almost reversed January's 2.3 percent rise. 
Spending on federal government construction projects plunged 11.9 percent, the biggest decline since October 2004, after surging 13.4 percent in January. 
State and local government construction outlays fell 1.0 percent after rising 1.3 percent in January. The drop in public construction spending dwarfed a 0.7 percent rise in investment in private construction projects.

""We expect only limited gains in public construction spending this year, based on the budget constraints at the state and local level,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending accelerating 0.5 percent in February. Construction spending increased 3.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.
February's marginal increase in construction spending could have implications for first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates, which are mostly below a 2 percent annualized rate.
In February, spending on public construction projects tumbled 2.1 percent, almost reversing January's 2.3 percent rise. February's drop was the largest since June 2017.
Spending on federal government construction projects plunged 11.9 percent, the biggest decline since October 2004, after surging 13.4 percent in January.
State and local government construction outlays fell 1.0 percent after rising 1.3 percent in January.
Spending on private construction projects increased 0.7 percent after falling 0.7 percent in January. Outlays on private residential projects edged up 0.1 percent to the highest level since January 2007. They rose 0.1 percent in January.

Spending on nonresidential structures rebounded 1.5 percent in February after dropping 1.7 percent in the prior month.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.0 in March from February's 51.6, countering economists' expectations for a slight uptick to 51.7.
While the index remained above the 50-point mark that divides growth from contraction on a monthly basis, it was the weakest reading since November and signaled only a marginal improvement in operating conditions at the end of the first quarter.
The findings contrasted with official data on Saturday, which showed manufacturing growth picked up more than expected in March in response to stronger domestic and overseas demand. The two reports often diverge, possibly due to differences in the number and type of businesses surveyed.
The Caixin PMI, which tends to focus on smaller firms, suggested output and new orders grew only modestly in March, with growth in export orders slumping to a 10-month low even as fears grow of a possible trade war between the United States and China.
The survey cited subdued foreign demand, and did not mention if there had been any impact yet from escalating trade tensions.
The Trump administration slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week and then targeted China specifically by announcing plans for additional tariffs of up to $60 billion of Chinese goods, which are expected to focus largely on its tech and telecommunications products.
A resurgent yuan could also be weighing more on smaller exporters. The Chinese currency has gained more than 3 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, on top of a 6.7 percent rise in 2017.
Chinese manufacturers also continued to reduce headcounts in March to cut costs, with the rate of job shedding still modest but the quickest since last August, the survey showed. 
""Overall, the manufacturing PMI reading in March showed that demand was not as strong as expected, leading to lower willingness of manufacturers to produce and restock,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the release.
""However, the ability of manufacturers to make a profit was beefed up by the stable increase in new orders and the much slower jump in input costs.""
Input price inflation continued to cool, hitting a nine-month low, while firms raised their selling prices at a slightly quicker pace than the previous month. 
But many businesses appear to believe the weakness in March orders was only a soft patch, with optimism about the one-year outlook picking up to the highest in a year, underpinned by expectations that greater investment, improved market conditions and new products will all help to boost demand. 
Overall, China's economic data so far this year suggest the economy has carried solid growth momentum into the first quarter from last year, with a government think tank forecasting the economy will grow 6.9 percent in the first half.
But economists are sticking to forecasts that China's pace will slow to around 6.5 percent by the end of the year, weighed down by the cooling property market and rising borrowing costs, even if there are no global trade shocks.
""The growth momentum of the Chinese manufacturing economy may have weakened in March, but at a marginal pace,"" said CEBM Group's Zhong.
China is aiming for economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year, the same target as in 2017, while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, Premier Li Keqiang said in March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment worsened for the first time in two years in the three months to March, a closely watched central bank survey showed on Monday, as rising raw materials and labor costs weigh on an otherwise steady economic recovery.
A strong yen and simmering fears of a trade war, triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, could further undermine corporate morale if threats of retaliation escalate, analysts say.
But few analysts expect the economic recovery to falter as business confidence remains at a decade-high level and companies plan to increase capital expenditure.
""Yen gains since late January have eroded manufacturers' sentiment but solid global economic fundamentals helped offset the pain. Overall, you can say that business confidence held firm,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""Fears of a global trade war have had a limited impact on business sentiment so far. But depending on development of U.S. trade policy, protectionism could weigh on the outlook.""
An index measuring big manufacturers' confidence fell by 2 points to plus 24 in March, the Bank of Japan's quarterly ""tankan"" survey showed, roughly matching a median market forecast of plus 25.
Non-manufacturers' sentiment worsened by 2 points to plus 23 against a median forecast of plus 24, deteriorating for the first time in six quarters.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers forecast business conditions would sour three months ahead, the tankan showed, reflecting looming uncertainty over the fallout from Trump's trade policy and a strong yen.
""This should not be taken as turning point for Japan's economy although sentiment deteriorated slightly,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""Concerns are high over possible retaliation against U.S. tariffs, but the global economy remains in a gradual recovery which is good for Japan's value-added exports.""
About 70 percent of companies replied to the survey by March 12, after Trump unveiled steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports but before his announcement of anti-China tariffs.
Big manufacturers expect the dollar to move around 109.66 yen on average during the year that began in April, much weaker than the current levels around 106 yen.
If the yen's gains continue, manufacturers may be forced to cut their optimistic profit forecasts - a worry for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is pursuing growth with reflationist policies.
LABOR SHORTAGES
Labor shortages also weighed on sentiment, as economic recovery and a dwindling working-age population push the jobless rate to a near 25-year low.
A tankan index measuring capacity constraints showed that companies saw the job market at its tightest since 1991.
""Labor shortages are having a negative impact particularly on labor-intensive service-sector firms,"" said Satoshi Osanai, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. 
He said rising wages could stoke a ""virtuous growth cycle"" of consumer spending, rising prices and increased investment if companies could pass on their higher costs to generate profit. ""The key to making this happen is whether consumers are willing to spend their increased earnings, but so far there's little sign of that happening.""
Slow wage growth and companies' reluctance to raise prices have kept inflation well below the Bank of Japan's elusive 2 percent target.
However, the tankan showed more companies were able to pass higher costs on to consumers, a hopeful sign for the central bank.
A tankan index measuring how big manufacturers saw output price moves stood at plus 4, the highest level since 2008, and showing price pressures continue to rise.
Some firms in the construction, restaurant and hotel industries complained that labor shortages were taking a toll on their businesses, a BOJ official briefing reporters on the data said.
Firms in the basic materials business such as those selling steel, nonferrous metals and textiles saw sentiment hurt by rising cost of raw materials, the official said.
The index measuring steelmakers' sentiment fell 9 points, the biggest drop among big manufacturers, while confidence also slumped among producers of nonferrous metals and metal products. 
Still, big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 2.3 percent in the current financial year from April, versus the median estimate for a 0.6 percent gain, the tankan showed.

The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 10:09PM ET</span>","South Korea's March exports climb for 17th straight month, misses forecast","By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports grew less than expected in March, adding to worries about the outlook for global demand amid growing fears of a U.S-China trade war and a resurgence in protectionism.
Booming demand for South Korean memory chips and computers across China and Europe lifted March exports, while shipments to the United States fell amid rising U.S. protectionism, resulting in a smaller trade surplus with Washington. 
March exports grew 6.1 percent to $51.6 billion from a year earlier, below 7.5 percent seen in a Reuters survey but outperforming a revised 3.9 percent expansion in February, government data showed on Sunday.
Imports increased 5 percent to $44.7 billion, less than the 6.2 percent growth economists had expected and compared with a revised 14.9 percent in February.
That resulted in a trade surplus of $6.9 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the previous month. 
The soft February readings were likely skewed by the long Lunar New Year holiday which fell in the middle of the month this year but in late January last year. 
Exports grew 10.3 percent in January-March combined from a year earlier, slower than the 14.6 percent expansion seen during the same period in 2017. 
""Exports growth is steady, it's likely to continue to post single-digit expansion. But there's dangers of a global trade war, a downside risk to Korea exports,"" said Park Sang-hyun, a Seoul-based economist at HI Investment & Securities. 
Shipments to the United States declined 1 percent in the first 20 days of March from a year earlier even as Korean memory chips sold well, as American demand for South Korean cars were sluggish.
Exports to China and the European Union jumped 16.6 percent and 24.2 percent, respectively. 
South Korea's trade surplus with the United States stood at $1.05 billion as of March this year, down by about 41.5 percent from the same time last year amid ongoing efforts by Seoul to import more from the United States in the past year.
Korea's trade ministry data shows that a drop in car exports combined with a steady increase in imports of U.S. beef, oranges and aircraft engines have resulted in a decline in the trade surplus with the United States. 
The Bank of Korea expects the trade-reliant economy to expand by 3 percent this year after 3.1 percent growth in 2017, the fastest expansion since it grew 3.3 percent in 2014.
However, policymakers are wary of risks to exports as the Trump administration begins rolling out a series of punitive trade measures which would hit countries such as South Korea and its biggest trading partner, China. 
The United States and South Korea agreed last week to revise their six-year-old free trade agreement with a side deal to deter competitive currency devaluation by Seoul and give more access for U.S. automakers and drugmakers to the South Korean market. 
The deal also lifted the threat of a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imports of steel from South Korea in exchange for quotas that will effectively cut U.S. imports of Korean steel by about 30 percent. Without the agreement in place, the tariffs would take effect on May 1.

But President Donald Trump said on Thursday he may hold up the trade agreement reached with South Korea until after a deal is finalised with North Korea on denuclearization, increasing uncertainties for the trade outlook.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",China March factory growth stronger than expected: official PMI,"By Stella Qiu and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector picked up more than expected in March as authorities lifted winter pollution restrictions and steel mills cranked up production as construction activity swings back into high gear.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Saturday rose to 51.5 in March, from 50.3 in February, and was well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would pick up only slightly to 50.5.
The findings add to a growing amount of data which suggest that China's economy has carried more momentum into the first quarter from last year than analysts had expected, which should keep synchronized global growth on track for a while longer even as trade tensions build. 
February's print had been the lowest in 1-1/2 years, but many analysts suspected it was due to disruptions related to the long Lunar New Year holidays, not a sharp drop in consumption.
Indeed, the March survey showed manufacturers shifted into higher gear as usual as seasonal demand picked up at home and abroad. The sub-index for output jumped to 53.1 from 50.3 in February, while total new orders rose to 53.3 from 51.0 and export orders climbed to 51.3 from 49.0.
The China Logistics Information Centre, in a commentary on the PMI figures, said it expected first-quarter economic growth to be about 6.8 percent. Early this year, economists polled by Reuters were penciling in a fade to around 6.6 percent.
Large companies saw a modest pickup in growth, while small firms' activity expanded marginally after shrinking in February.
Helping drive positive sentiment, exports have been better than expected in the first two months of the year, particularly for tech products, the fastest-growing segment of China's industrial sector. Though a sub PMI for hi-tech manufacturing eased in March, growth remained solid.
However, a sharp escalation in trade tensions with the United States is clouding the outlook for both China's ""old economy"" heavy industries and ""new economy"" tech firms.
The Trump administration slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week and then targeted China specifically with plans for additional tariffs of up to $60 billion of its goods, likely focusing on tech and telecommunications products.
""Stress tests have shown the new U.S. tariffs will have a relatively small impact on Chinese steel. Chinese steel firms should not be overly worried and should focus on guaranteeing demand from the domestic market and our major exporters,"" the China Steel Logistics Professional Committee said.
""But it's worth noting that the amount of steel products we supply to U.S. consumers through the global supply chain may well exceed China's direct exports to the United States,"" it added. ""China should proactively oppose U.S. unilateral trade protectionism to maintain the global supply chain.""
SPRING FORWARD OR FALL BACK?
This spring could see a major test of Chinese manufacturers' surprising 1-1/2-year run.
In the first quarter, China's steel companies defied expectations for a winter lull and continued to ramp up output in response to strong sales, while boosting borrowing, capital expenditure and hiring, a survey from the China Beige Book showed on Wednesday.
Production increased further after winter smog controls expired on March 15 in many areas. A separate PMI on the steel sector rose to 50.6 in March from 49.5 in February, the China Logistics Information Centre (CLIC) said.
But the burst in output has pushed steel inventories to multi-year highs, sending prices sharply lower and reducing mills' profit margins.
At the same time, growth in property sales and new construction starts appears to be slowing, and Beijing has hit the brakes on some local governments' infrastructure spending due to concerns over high debt levels.
Those factors, along with rising borrowing costs, should weigh on activity eventually, with economists sticking to forecasts that China's growth will cool to around 6.5 percent by the end of the year.
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturing and industrial firms helped the economy produce better-than-expected growth of 6.9 percent in 2017.
SERVICES GROWTH ALSO ACCELERATES
A sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also kicked up a notch in March, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 54.6 from 54.4.
A sub-reading for construction activity stood at 60.7 in March, up from 57.5 in February.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.
China is aiming for economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year, the same target as in 2017, while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month.

A composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.0 in March, from February's 52.9.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>","South Korea's February output unexpectedly rises on-month on demand for cars, chips","By Cynthia Kim and Dahee Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's industrial output unexpectedly rose in February as robust overseas demand continued to boost production of memory chips and cars in a sign factory activity remained brisk.
Statistics Korea on Friday said factory output rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 percent in February from January, expanding for a second month in a row and beating the median forecast of a 0.5 percent decline.
""Output of cars benefited from a low base as December saw car union strikes. Production of memory chips also was a positive impulse to February data,"" a Statistics Korea official said.
Factory output rose a downwardly revised 0.9 percent in January on-month.
From a year earlier, factory output dropped 6.4 percent compared with the forecast for a 3.1 percent decline, marking the biggest on-year decline since 2013.
An official with the Statistics Korea said the large on-year contraction in February was mostly due to distortions from the Lunar New Year period.
""The Lunar New Year holidays falling in February this year, as opposed to January for last year reduced the number of working days,"" the official said.
Although the recovery in industrial production has been uneven over the past year, the monthly gain in output supports optimism among policymakers that the economy can carry its recent run of strong growth into 2018 thanks to robust exports.
""Increasing public spending is lifting consumer spending and that will help increase production in the coming months,"" said Lee Sang-jae, chief economist, Eugene Investment and Securities.
The Bank of Korea expects the economy to expand by 3 percent this year, after 3.1 percent growth in 2017, the fastest expansion since it grew 3.3 percent in 2014.

In February, car production increased 5.1 percent from January while output of memory chips gained 4.7 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial production rebounded in February from a large decline in the previous month and companies forecast further gains in coming months in a sign that factory output is back on the path toward expansion. 
Factory output rose 4.1 percent in February from the previous month, less than economists' median estimate of a 5.0 percent increase but recovering from a revised 6.8 percent decline in January, trade ministry data showed on Friday. 
The increase was led by higher output of cars, construction equipment, and semiconductors.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to rise 0.9 percent in March and increase 5.2 percent in April.
Separate data showed labor demand eased slightly and the jobless rate edged higher in February, but the labor market is expected to remain tight due to a shortage of workers.
Gains in industrial output suggest that January's weakness was temporary and the economy remains poised to extend its record growth streak due to solid exports and improving domestic demand.
Output of cars, engines, and car parts rose 10.3 percent in February, the fastest increase since April last year.
Production of construction equipment and factory machinery rose 3.6 percent in February, while production of semiconductors and electronic parts rose 4.8 percent.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.58 from 1.59 in January, which is the highest in 44 years. The jobless rate rose to 2.5 percent in February from 2.4 percent in the previous month.
Japan's economy has grown for eight straight quarters, its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy, moving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's revival plan a step closer to vanquishing decades of stagnation.
Consumer spending, exports, and capital expenditure have helped drive growth. 

Economists say consumer spending could lose some momentum this year but they expect exports to remain strong thanks to sustained global demand.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1 percent in January, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday, in a clear sign that first-quarter growth is likely to be weaker than the Bank of Canada had predicted.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected gross domestic product to increase by 0.1 percent after a revised 0.2 percent gain in December. January's drop was the first since a 0.1 percent decline in August 2017.
In January, the central bank forecast first-quarter annualized growth of 2.5 percent, but it looks set to cut that estimate when it issues updated numbers on April 18.
""The underlying story is that growth remains on a sluggish underlying path of less than 2 percent ... for the Bank of Canada, this reinforces the point that there is little urgency to hike rates again,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group.
The central bank has raised interest rates three times since last July and says future moves will be heavily dependent on economic data.
Analysts noted that January GDP had been hit by temporary factors. Unscheduled maintenance shutdowns at some oil facilities helped cut non-conventional extraction by 7.1 percent while real estate and rental and leasing declined by 0.5 percent as tougher mortgage lending rules took effect.
""We expect a bounceback in February and March GDP, but we're going to revise down our first quarter GDP forecast to sub 2 percent, adding weight to our view that the Bank of Canada is on hold until July,"" said Avery Shenfeld of CIBC Economics.
Canada's economy grew a modest 1.7 percent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter, well below the Bank of Canada's 2.5 percent forecast.
In a note to clients, Krishen Rangasamy and Matthieu Arseneau of NBF Economics and Strategy said they expected first quarter growth of 1.5 percent.
Pre-election budgets unveiled this week in Ontario and Quebec - Canada's two most populous provinces - should then boost growth later in the year, they added.

Separately, Statscan said producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in February as a weaker domestic currency boosted the cost of motorized and recreational vehicles.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending up slightly; jobless claims at 45-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose marginally for a second straight month in February as households boosted savings, the latest indication that the economy lost momentum in the first quarter.
But the economy's fundamentals remain strong, with other data on Thursday showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropping to more than a 45-year low last week. A tightening labor market is expected to start driving up wages by the second half of this year. 
Consumer spending has been tepid this year despite strong consumer confidence, which has been bolstered by income tax cuts. Some economists said the tax cuts, which came into effect in January, only reflected on most workers' paychecks in late February. They also believed that delays in processing tax refunds had contributed to holding back spending.
""The outlook for spending on discretionary categories is obviously more uncertain, though there are some plausible reasons to expect better consumption outcomes ahead,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""Relative to years past, tax refunds were paid out slower at the start of this year.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January. It was supported by a rebound in spending on long-lasting goods, such as motor vehicles, as was a rise in financial services and insurance expenditures.
The increase in consumer spending in February was in line with economists' expectations. 
There was also a moderation in monthly inflation readings after prices pushed higher in January. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.3 percent in January.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6 percent, the biggest gain since February 2017, from 1.5 percent in January. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. It has been below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
Economists believe the annual core PCE price index could accelerate to 1.9 percent in March as last year's weak readings drop out of the calculation. The Fed raised interest rates last week and forecast at least two more rate hikes this year.
""Policymakers can be confident about the inflation outlook and will likely keep with the plan to raise rates a couple more times this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Inflation is not heating up, but pressures are building.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Prices of U.S. government bonds rose.
SLOWING GDP GROWTH
The steady rise in inflation last month also helped curb consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged in February after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. That suggests a sharp slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter after it surged at an eye-popping 4.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
The tepid consumer spending added to data on trade, housing and business spending on equipment that have left economists anticipating moderate economic growth in the first quarter.
Data forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers cut its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.5 percent rate. Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) lowered their forecast to a 1.7 percent rate from 1.8 percent. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
In February, personal income rose 0.4 percent, matching the increase of the previous two months. Wages increased 0.5 percent last month after climbing 0.6 percent in January. 
Savings increased to $497.4 billion in February, the highest level since August 2017, from $471.3 billion in the prior month. That lifted the saving rate to a six-month high of 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent in January.
Income growth could pick up as the labor market tightens further, which should help to support consumer spending.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended March 24, the lowest level since January 1973.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.

""These data continue to flash further tightening in labor market conditions with firms unwilling to fire existing workers, presumably because of the difficulty of finding replacements,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Capital flight had been seen as a major risk for China in early 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.
Chinese firms are expected to allocate overseas assets more rationally in 2018, while foreign investors are seen making steady investment plans in China as it further opens up its financial markets, SAFE said.
China's 2018 current account surplus of $164.9 billion was the equivalent of 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's jobless total dropped more than expected in March and unemployment hit a record low, adding impetus to a labor market that had already become the linchpin of a consumer-led upswing.
Household spending has turned into the main source of growth in Europe's biggest economy, propelled by rising employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
Federal Labour Office data on Thursday showed the seasonally adjusted jobless number fell by 19,000 to 2.373 million, more than the 15,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
Separately, regional data pointed to a rise in the national inflation rate in March, though leaving it still well below the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone, suggesting price pressures remain muted.
Unemployment dropped to 5.3 percent last month from 5.4 percent in February, the lowest since Germany reunified in 1990.
""The positive development of the labor market continued in March,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said. He said companies created more jobs with full social benefits and were continuing to look for more staff.
The data showed that Germany's prolonged upswing is now also pushing down the once stubbornly high number of long-term unemployed, which fell by 9 percent on the year to 845,000.
Opposition parties have accused Chancellor Angela Merkel of neglecting the long-term unemployed at a time when German firms are struggling with unprecedented skill shortages.
In the coalition deal signed this month, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) persuaded Merkel's conservatives to help integrate the long-term unemployed by creating 150,000 subsidized jobs at a cost of 4 billion euros ($4.9 billion).
Seasonally adjusted employment in Germany as measured by the International Labour Organisation climbed to a record 44.59 million in February, separate Federal Statistics Office data showed on Thursday.
TRADE THREAT
The rock-solid labor market is likely to further boost consumer confidence and household spending in Europe's biggest economy, where domestic demand has taken over from exports as the main growth driver.
The government has forecast a 2.4 percent expansion for this year, which would be the fastest rate since 2011.
Consumer sentiment rose unexpectedly heading into April, according to a GfK survey released on Wednesday, as shoppers became more upbeat about their income and were more willing to spend.
""Full order books and the strong growth of the global economy make it unlikely that the job boom will come to an end in spring,"" KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said - though the threat of a trade dispute with the United States had made firms far less optimistic about future business.
""The losers of a spiral of protectionism between the U.S. and the EU would be consumers and employees on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Zeuner said.
Household spending has also been helped by moderate inflation, which has broadly undercut average pay settlements to leave employees with more disposable income.
Thursday's regional inflation readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into a nationwide number due at 1200 GMT that a Reuters poll has forecast at 1.6 percent, compared with 1.2 percent in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's current account deficit was much smaller than expected last year, its statistics office said on Thursday, potentially easing concerns about the country's reliance on foreign investors to fund itself as Brexit nears.
The Office for National Statistics also confirmed economic growth slowed slightly at the end of 2017 though the dominant services sector picked up a bit at the start of this year.
The current account deficit stood at 18.4 billion pounds ($25.9 billion) in the fourth quarter, much lower than a median forecast of 24 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists and below all forecasts in the poll.
That left the full-year deficit at 82.9 billion pounds or 4.1 percent of GDP, the narrowest as a share of the economy since 2011 and down sharply from a record high of 5.8 percent in 2016.
""The UK's deficit with the rest of the world shrank as the UK received increased earnings on foreign investment thanks to a growing world economy,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said Britain's balance of payments shortfall leaves it reliant on the ""kindness of strangers"". 
The country's official budget forecasters said this month they expected the gap to fall only slowly in coming years, and that the confidence of overseas investors could be damaged if Britain's departure from the European Union was disorderly.
The ONS confirmed gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent on the quarter - slowing from 0.5 percent in the third quarter - and 1.4 percent compared with the last three months of 2016.
For 2017, the ONS raised its economic growth estimate to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent previously.
However, the annual rate remained the lowest since 2012 and Britain continues to lag behind stronger growth in other rich economies, hurt by the hit to consumer spending after the 2016 Brexit vote which weakened the pound and pushed up inflation.
The ONS said disposable household incomes, adjusted for inflation, only inched up 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. 
The savings ratio for 2017 was the lowest on record at 4.9 percent of gross disposable income, and the ONS said households were net borrowers for the first time since records began in 1987.
Separate data on Thursday showed Britain's housing market remained soft, reflecting the financial squeeze on many households.
The Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 63,910 in February from 67,110 in January, below economists' forecasts of a smaller drop to 66,000 in a Reuters poll.
Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices in Britain rose at the slowest pace in seven months in March.
The ONS said Britain dominant services sector grew by a monthly 0.2 percent in January, picking up some speed. Over the three months to January, growth of 0.6 percent was the fastest since the end of 2016.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:32AM ET</span>",China's manufacturing growth seen picking up slightly in March,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector likely picked up slightly in March as authorities lifted winter industrial pollution restrictions and steel mills cranked up production as construction activity swings back into high gear.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to have risen to 50.5 in March from February's 50.3, according to a median forecast of 29 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
That would mark the 20th straight month of expansion for China's vast manufacturing sector, and reinforce consensus views that the world's second-largest economy will see only a modest slowdown in growth this year.
A separate survey last week by World Economics, a private economic data provider, showed a gauge of sentiment among sales managers jumped to an eight-month high in March, with growth in manufacturing sales hitting a three-year peak. 
Driving the positive sentiment are better-than-expected manufacturing output and exports in the first two months of the year, particularly in tech shipments, the fastest-growing segment of China's industrial sector.
Sino-U.S. trade relations will be key to China's manufacturing outlook, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese tech and telecommunications shipments to the United States.
Similarly, swelling inventories of steel could weigh on future production, following a burst of output in recent months. Steel prices have already tumbled in recent sessions as steel stocks hit multi-year highs. [IRONORE/]
In the first quarter, Chinese steel companies defied expectations for a winter lull and continued to ramp up output in response to strong sales, and boosted borrowing, capital expenditure and hiring, a survey from the China Beige Book showed on Wednesday.
SOLID MOMENTUM
Overall, China's economic data so far this year suggest the economy has carried solid growth momentum into the first quarter from last year, with a government think tank forecasting the economy will grow 6.9 percent in the first half.
That would keep global growth on track. But economists are sticking to forecasts that China's pace will slow later in the year, weighed down by a cooling property markets and rising borrowing costs.
Economists expect a private survey on China's factory activity next week will show a similar firming trend as in the official survey, after growth in February picked up to a six-month high. 
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will be 51.7 in March versus 51.6 the previous month.
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from a year-long, state-led construction boom as large, government-owned industrial heavyweights.
The official PMI survey will be published on March 31, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on April 2, with the Caixin services PMI to be released on April 4.

Key Takeaways
A sustained, robust rise in consumer spending is needed for Japan’s export-driven economic recovery to become self-sustaining. While wages and spending have improved, the pay raises needed to drive inflation higher have eluded workers for some time. The results of this year’s spring wage negotiations point to slightly bigger raises than last year, but they are unlikely to spur significantly stronger consumption.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:16PM ET</span>","Japan retail sales rise in February, suggest growing consumer confidence","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose in February as shoppers spent more on food, drinks and clothes, suggesting rising wages and a tight labour market are supporting consumer confidence. 
The 1.6 percent annual increase in retail sales in February was slightly less than the median estimate for a 1.7 percent annual increase and follows a revised 1.5 percent annual increase in January.
Rising consumer spending makes it more likely that consumer prices will rise in the future, which could help the Bank of Japan reach its elusive 2 percent inflation target, although its ultra-easy monetary policy will still be in place for some time.
""Consumer spending looks like it is at the beginning of a mild recovery,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The labour market is improving, which is supportive. There is a dip in durable goods spending, but spending on other items is gaining some momentum.""
Spending on food and drinks rose 2.3 percent in February from a year ago, data from the trade ministry showed on Thursday, picking up from January's 2.0 percent annual increase. 
Spending on clothes rose an annual 0.3 percent in February, rebounding slightly from a 0.5 percent annual decline in January.
On the negative side, spending on cars fell an annual 2.1 percent in February, deepening a 0.3 percent annual decline in January.
Spending on electronics, which includes durable goods such as washing machines and refrigerators, rose 4.6 percent year-on-year in February, slower than a 5.2 percent year-on-year increase in January. 
Big Japanese companies agreed earlier this month at annual negotiations with labour unions to raise wages for a fifth year.This wage hike could help consumer spending to boost Japan's stubbornly slow inflation, but many companies likely fell short of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of increasing wages by 3 percent or more.
Japan's jobs-to-applicants ratio, a measure of labour demand, is forecast to have risen to the highest in four decades in February. The data is due on Friday.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 1.0 percent in February from a year earlier, matching the median estimate, data last week showed.

However, a narrower measure of consumer prices that excludes fresh food and energy rose an annual 0.5 percent in February, highlighting the snail's pace of underlying inflation.

The headline gauge of consumer confidence, compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission, rose to -7 from -10 in February. 
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to another reading of -10.
""The prospect of wage rises finally outstripping declining inflation, high levels of employment with low-level interest rates, and finally some movement on the Brexit front appear to have boosted our spirits,"" Joe Staton, head of experience innovation UK at GfK, said in a statement.
Prime Minister Theresa May this month secured an outline deal to keep Britain's access to the European Union's single market unchanged for 21 months after Brexit in March next year.
That political breakthrough was accompanied by economic data that showed a pickup in the pace of wage growth and inflation continuing its fall, having jumped after the Brexit vote.
However, GfK's consumer confidence measure remained in negative territory, where it has been since early 2016, and another survey published on Thursday found households turned a bit more pessimistic in March.
Opinion polling firm YouGov said its index edged down one point to 107.7, the first fall since November, although households reported an improvement in their finances.
Separately on Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry, an employers group, said growth in Britain's private sector slowed in the first three months of the year.
The survey of 650 firms showed the balance of companies reporting a rise in output at +8 percent, down from +20 percent in the three months to February, but growth was expected to pick up in the second quarter, the CBI said.

The Bank of England said last week it expected heavy snowfall in February and March meant overall economic growth would a bit slower than it had previously forecast.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>",U.S. fourth-quarter growth revised up to 2.9 percent; consumer spending surges,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter as the biggest gain in consumer spending in three years partially offset the drag from a jump in imports. 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2017, instead of the previously reported 2.5 percent, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate for the quarter on Wednesday. That was a slight moderation from the third quarter's brisk 3.2 percent pace.
The upward revision to the fourth-quarter growth estimate also reflected less inventory reduction than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had expected that fourth-quarter GDP growth would be revised up to a 2.7 percent rate. 
There are signs that economic activity slowed further in the first quarter, with retail sales falling in February for a third straight month. Housing data have been generally weak and the trade deficit hit a more than nine-year high in January.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 1.8 percent rate in the January-March period. First-quarter GDP growth tends to be weak because of a seasonal quirk. 
Still, analysts believe the economy will hit the Trump administration's 3 percent annual growth target this year, driven by the $1.5 trillion tax cut package and an increase in government spending.
That could keep the door open to slightly more aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. The U.S. central bank raised rates last week and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018. The Fed also lifted its economic growth projections for this year and 2019.
""Tax cuts and stronger government spending will boost average GDP growth to 2.9 percent in 2018,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We forecast this environment will lead the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year.""
There are worries the Trump administration's adoption of protectionist trade measures could sour business sentiment and hurt spending on capital goods. 
President Donald Trump last week signed a memorandum targeting up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs over what his administration says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property. Trump also has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. 
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, an acceleration from the 1.5 percent logged in 2016. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Wednesday's data. Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher, while prices of U.S. Treasuries edged up. The dollar (DXY) firmed against a basket of currencies, pushing further away from a five-week low in the prior session.
SLOW INCOME GROWTH
The government also reported on Wednesday that after-tax corporate profits increased at a 1.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a 5.7 percent pace in the third quarter. 
As a result, an alternate measure of growth, gross domestic income, rose at a 0.9 percent rate in the October-December period. GDI expanded at a 2.4 percent rate in the third quarter. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 1.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. That followed a 2.8 percent rate of growth in the prior period.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to a 4.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter from the 3.8 percent pace reported last month. That was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2 percent rate of growth in the July-September period.
Imports grew at an upwardly revised 14.1 percent pace instead of the previously reported 14.0 percent rate. That was the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2010 and overshadowed a rise in exports driven by weakness in the dollar.
The resulting trade deficit sliced off 1.16 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter, the most in a year, after adding 0.36 percentage point in the third quarter. Trade will likely remain a drag on GDP growth in the first quarter.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed the goods trade deficit rose 0.1 percent in February as an increase in imports slightly outpaced a jump in exports.
""The drag (from trade) looks less meaningful than we had previously anticipated, likely coming in around a half percentage point,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
While robust consumer spending curbed the accumulation of inventories, the slowdown in inventory investment was not as steep as previously reported. 
Inventory investment rose at a rate of $15.6 billion in the fourth quarter instead of the previously reported $8.0 billion pace. Inventories subtracted 0.53 percentage point from GDP growth after adding 0.79 percentage point in the prior period. 
Inventories could contribute to growth in the first quarter. The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that both wholesale and retail inventories increased solidly in February. 

There were modest downward revisions to business and residential construction spending growth estimates in the fourth quarter. Growth in government spending was raised slightly.

The CBI distributive trades survey's retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists.
""Against a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,"" Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said.
""Freezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.""

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said 28 percent of companies expected to become more confident about hiring workers, compared with 19 percent who said less.
The survey of 600 companies was conducted between Nov. 24 and Feb. 28.
This month Brussels agreed a political, if not yet legal, deal to let Britain stay in the bloc's single market - but without a vote - for 21 months after Brexit next March.
""The announcement that EU workers who arrive in the transition period can stay is a positive step, but businesses need to know what access they'll have to EU workers after that time period so they can plan ahead effectively,"" Tom Hadley, director of policy at REC, said.
The survey showed only 17 percent of employers planned to increase permanent staff over the next four to 12 months.
""Employers are potentially turning to temps, which could bring opportunities to candidates interested in temporary work and the flexibility it affords, but is also a sign employers are affected by economic and political uncertainty,"" Hadley said.
Official data have pointed to a healthy labor market for the time being.
British workers' overall pay rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in the three months to January, bolstering the chances that the Bank of England will raise borrowing costs in May. The data also showed the number of people in work grew by 168,000, double the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.

While first-quarter revenue looked strong, every sector except manufacturing saw profit growth weaken from late 2017, while investment and cash flow softened, according to the quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB).
Weakness in the retail sector is of particular concern, with domestic demand hardly looking robust enough to support growth if China's exports suffer from punitive U.S. trade measures, CBB added.
""A cloudy 2018 outlook certainly beats a downbeat one, but just a few months ago China’s strong finish to 2017 led most observers to believe that last year’s momentum would carry meaningfully through this year,"" CBB wrote in a note discussing its first-quarter findings.
""Still, the pace (of growth) at the end of 2018 will not match the halcyon days of 2017, even without a trade shock or any meaningful deleveraging.""
Defying expectations for a winter lull, Chinese steel companies continued to ramp up output in response to strong sales, and also boosted borrowing, capital expenditures and hiring, the survey showed.
The consensus view had called for a slowdown in production as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and closes older, less efficient mills.
Despite Beijing's pledge to continue to reduce excess capacity, the steel sector hiked overall capacity for the eighth straight quarter, CBB said.
""The tougher question is what’s going to drive growth a year from now. Property and commodities both need an extended breather, and it’s difficult to imagine the surprising manufacturing performance of the last two years continuing much longer.""
RISKS
China's high-flying property market is cooling, with developers responding to weaker sales by slowing down investment and new housing starts, the survey showed.
The retail sector also continues to lag other industries, notably in the form of the biggest quarter-on-quarter decline in sales prices seen for the sector.
CBB also discounted the view that rising demand from China could lead to it exporting inflation globally, as firms said wage, input cost and sales price inflation have been steady or declining for the past three quarters.
The survey also showed that corporate borrowing remained steady in the first quarter, despite rising interest rates as regulators crack down on riskier financing practices.
Most analysts who forecast slower economic growth for China this year cite the cooling property market and higher borrowing costs as the main expected drags on activity.
But CBB noted regulators have largely focused their attentions so far on the financial sector and shadow banking rather than reining in corporate debt, which would risk curbing economic growth.
""Banks and non-banks do feel pressure to shrink their off-balance sheet transactions, but this is not the same as deleveraging,"" CBB said.
Economists polled by Reuters expect China's growth to cool to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017.

In explaining its fourth consecutive decision to hold the seven-day interbank lending rate steady, the central bank said the pace of hikes in regulated prices for utilities and transportation, crucial to President Mauricio Macri's efforts to cut the fiscal deficit, would slow down after April.
""The acceleration of inflation in recent months is transitory and is due to large increases in regulated prices and the rapid depreciation of the peso between December and February,"" the statement read.
The central bank said annual wage negotiations were resulting in salary increases consistent with the government's 2018 inflation target of 15 percent, and that its recent interventions in the foreign exchange market meant the peso was not expected to devalue further in the coming months.
The bank has sold more than $1.7 billion in reserves since the beginning of March to prevent the peso <ARS=RASL> from further falling. Twelve-month inflation printed 25.4 percent in February, up from 25 percent the month before. The government is expected to publish March inflation data on April 14.
""Once the aforementioned transitory impacts conclude, inflation will descend toward the desired path,"" the monetary authority said in a statement. ""The central bank is prepared to act by adjusting its monetary policy rate if that does not occur.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell from more than a 17-year high in March amid stock market volatility, but households remained upbeat about labor market conditions, which could help to support consumer spending. 
The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index dropped 2.3 points to a reading of 127.7 this month from a slightly downwardly revised 130.0 in February, which was the highest level since November 2000. The index was previously reported at 130.8 in February.
""The stock market has been volatile and consumers don't like market volatility. The pullback in confidence is not a concern for the economic outlook this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Still, we wonder if the decline in confidence means that the economy may have seen its best days already for this cycle.""
U.S. stocks have been under pressure over the past two months as worries about inflation led some investors to speculate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more aggressively than currently anticipated. 
Wall Street has also been roiled by the threat of a global trade war after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. President Donald Trump last week signed a memorandum targeting up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs over what his administration says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property.
The S&P 500 index has dropped about 2 percent so far in March, coming on the heels of a decline of nearly 4 percent in February and putting stocks on pace for their worst two-month performance since the December 2015-January 2016 period. 
Stocks were trading higher on Tuesday as fears of a trade war between the United States and China eased. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries climbed as fund managers bought bonds to rebalance their portfolios for the end of the quarter in advance of more government debt supply.
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH 
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 25.0 in March, the strongest reading since May 2001, from 24.0 in February.
That measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, suggests that labor market slack continues to shrink.
""This report combined with the March jobless claims data points to another 200,000-plus reading on payrolls in March, which we judge would push the unemployment rate down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The economy added 313,000 jobs in February. Labor market tightness has left economists optimistic that wage growth will soon pick up. That, together with lower income taxes, are expected to spur consumer spending in the coming quarters.
Retail sales have declined for three straight months, leading economists to expect a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a robust 3.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
Rising house prices could also boost consumer spending. A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 6.4 percent in the 12 months to January after rising 6.3 percent in December.
Higher house prices are bolstering household wealth. But the house price inflation is being driven by an acute shortage of homes available for sale, which is hurting the housing market.

""If we continue to see a steady stream of buyers and owners remain largely uninterested in selling, we can expect prices to continue to rise,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government on Tuesday hiked its 2018 growth forecast to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent previously as it unveiled an overdue budget draft for this year which it however lacks parliamentary support to adopt.
The new prediction is a sign the Spanish economy remains unaffected by a political crisis in Catalonia which has unnerved investors and prompted hundreds of companies to move out of the restive region or review investment plans there.
The economy ministry said the new forecast was the result of easing political uncertainty and expectations that the world and European economies would expand more than initially thought in 2018.
Credit rating agency S&P last week raised Spain's sovereign credit rating to A- from BBB+ and kept its outlook positive saying the Spanish economy would expand faster than the rest of the euro zone while the budget deficit would keep shrinking and the overall economic performance would likely not be hampered by the situation in Catalonia.
While the Catalan crisis has not weighed significantly on the economy, it has brought to a halt parliamentary activity in Madrid as the many parties forming the national assembly are divided on how to deal with the issue.
The Basque nationalist party PNV, which votes are needed to pass the budget law, has said it would not help pass the bill until the government resolves the situation in Catalonia.
Rajoy, who has already reached a deal with centrist party Ciudadanos on tax cuts and on boosting public pensions and salaries of public workers, is hoping the PNV will soon reconsider its position.
""The government calls on all political parties to behave in a responsible way in the upcoming parliamentary debate and defend the general interest. Passing the budget law is a shared responsibility for all,"" the government's spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told a news conference.
If no deal is reached, the government is expected to extend the 2017 budget into 2019 when a general election has been penciled in for the end of the year.
The government said on Monday it had met the target it agreed with the European Union to reduce its public deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP for 2017 and confirmed its 2.2 percent goal for this year even if no new budget is voted.

It also sees the unemployment rate, currently the second highest in the euro zone after Greece, falling to 15 percent at the end of the year.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Euro zone sentiment falls in March, casting doubt on growth outlook","By Robert-Jan Bartunek
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Economic sentiment in the 19-countries sharing the euro slipped for the third month in a row in March, data from the European Commission showed on Tuesday, suggesting economic growth in the bloc was not as steady as previously thought.
The Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator fell to 112.6 in March from a revised 114.2 in February, below the average forecast of 113.4 in a Reuters poll of 34 economists.
The downbeat reading of economic sentiment paired with falling inflation expectations for consumers and manufacturers alike, as well as earlier data suggesting loan growth and money supply in euro zone had also slowed, kicked the euro off a five-week high.
Frictions between the West and Russia and trade restrictions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have spooked markets in recent weeks and appear to have also left their mark on managers and consumers in the real world, analysts said.
The European Central Bank recently said that euro zone growth may even outperform expectations in the near term, but the sentiment data is a further indication of a weakening trend, after business morale in Germany, the bloc's largest economy, fell to an 11-month low last week.
""While the economy continues to perform strongly, some clouds have re-emerged on the horizon,"" analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients.
The Commission expects the euro zone economy to increase by 2.3 percent this year after 2.4 percent growth in 2017.
The euro zone economy is still propped up by the ECB buying some 2.5 trillion euro ($3.11 trillion) worth of debt over the past three years, which has helped growth but has done little to boost inflation, which remains well under the central bank's target of close to but below 2 percent.
Declining economic sentiment in the euro zone fall was caused by declining optimism among managers in the manufacturing, services and retail sectors, while the construction sector showed a small improvement in sentiment.
In the retail sector, where the fall was sharpest, respondents gave a more negative assessment of the present business situation and their outlook for orders and employment.
Consumer sentiment was unchanged in March, compared to February, the Commission said, confirming an earlier flash estimate.

The Commission's Business Climate Indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, also fell by more than forecast in March to 1.34 from 1.48 in February.

Industrial companies with annual earnings of more than 20 million yuan reported profits of 968.9 billion yuan in January and February, which represented a 16.1% increase from a year earlier, the NBS said in a statement. This is compared to an increase of 31.5% recorded in the first two months of 2017.
Meanwhile, the reading was 5.3% higher than the growth recorded in December, with non-metal minerals, petroleum, natural gas, heating and pharmaceuticals cited as the fastest-growing sectors.
David Qu, a Shanghai-based analyst at ANZ, said the growth rate was “still a good number.”
""We believe it's highly likely that industrial profits will achieve double-digit growth for the rest of the year despite price slowdown.""
NBS statistician He Ping echoed Qu’s comments, while attributing the profit growth to improved profitability and reduced costs.
""While industrial profits maintained rapid growth, improvements were made in efficiency and profitability,"" he said.
The government releases combined January and February figures in order to smooth out distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holidays, which began in mid-February this year but late January last year.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>","China's Jan-Feb industrial profit growth strong, but pace slows from 2017","BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms picked up pace in the first two months of the year from December but still lagged growth for the whole of 2017, backing expectations the world's second-biggest economy is set to cool as Beijing clamps down on debt risks. 
Slowing earnings growth, following a six-year high last year, could deter investment and put further pressure on China's stock markets which have taken a knock in recent sessions on growing fears of a trade war with the United States.
Weaker earnings could also complicate Beijing's campaign to reduce a mountain of debt amassed by its state-owned giants, which dominate its heavy industries.[L4N1QS05F] 
Industrial profits rose 16.1 percent year-on-year to 968.9 billion yuan ($154.57 billion) in the first two months of the year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday. 
That compared with a 10.8 percent increase in December, though it lagged the 21.0 percent jump for 2017 as a whole, the fastest pace since 2011, as a construction boom boosted prices of building materials from steel bars to copper pipes and cement.
The higher growth from December was largely due to quickened sales with continued cost-cutting efforts, offsetting weaker prices, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement along with the data.
ANZ Shanghai-based analyst David Qu expects double-digit earnings growth for rest of the year ""despite price slowdown."" 
However, not all were bullish about the outlook, especially as factory-gate inflation - closely correlated with industrial profit growth - softened for the fourth straight month in February.
""Despite some improvement early in the year, we remain cautious on the near-term industrial profit growth outlook, Nomura analysts wrote in note to clients.
""The benefit from high prices should subside as PPI inflation continues to moderate, while the cooling property sector and rising trade protectionism should weigh on aggregate demand, and hence investment and output growth.""
The government releases combined January and February figures in an effort to smooth out distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year, which began in mid-February this year but late January last year.
Strong global demand also benefited China's exporters, though rapidly escalating trade tensions with the United States are clouding the outlook for a repeat performance this year.
Pointing to further profit pressure, Chinese steel futures prices have tumbled to their lowest in eight months on fears of an all-out global trade war and worries about weakening demand at home as the heated property market shows signs of cooling.[IRONORE/]
The sectoral earnings also highlight the uneven nature of growth. Mining industry profits rose 42.1 percent from a year earlier in January-February, while those for manufacturing were up 12.5 percent. 
ANZ's Qu said he expects energy-related industries to fare well this year, but cautions that markets may be too relaxed about liquidity conditions. 
""I'm concerned that the market may have been too optimistic about China keeping liquidity conditions relatively loose; Globally it's still getting tighter and tighter.""
DEBT BATTLE
China's economy grew at a surprisingly solid pace of 6.9 percent in 2017, thanks in part to the construction boom, but momentum is seen cooling this year as the effects of the regulatory clampdown on debt risks and pollution dent output.
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms rose 29.6 percent in January-February from the year before, slowing from a 45.1 percent increase in 2017.
Tuesday's data also showed Chinese industrial firms' liabilities increased 6.0 percent year-on-year by the end of February to 59.6 trillion yuan, compared with a 5.7 percent rise for 2017.
The ratio of liabilities to assets at industrial firms rose to 56.3 percent from 55.5 percent at the end of December, highlighting the challenges the government still faces in containing a rapid build-up in corporate debt.
Overall debt of China's centrally-administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is under control and is steadily declining, but reducing leverage and curbing risks in the sector remains a priority, the head of the state assets regulator said this month.
State firms will be pushed to improve their asset quality and boost their equity capital, said Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Many analysts, however, say the government has been too cautious in reforming lumbering, debt-laden state firms, fearing massive job losses and a blow to economic growth.

Details on highly touted debt-to-equity swaps announced so far have often been murky, and many China watchers suspect that many companies deemed ""too big to fail"" will be kept on state support.

The Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales dropped 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised up to 622,000 units from the previously reported 593,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that new home sales, which account for 10 percent of housing market sales, would rise 4.4 percent to a pace of 623,000 units last month. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. 
They rose 0.5 percent from a year ago. Sales decreased 3.7 percent in the Midwest and 17.6 percent in the West, which has experienced rapid price growth amid a shortage of homes for sale. They rebounded 19.4 percent in the Northeast and 9.0 percent in the South, which accounts for the bulk of new home sales. 
The housing market has slowed in recent months as an acute shortage of homes, especially on the lower end of the market, squeezes sales while pushing up prices. Rising mortgage rates could make buying a home even less affordable for first-time buyers, who have been largely priced out of the market.
The median new house price was $326,800, a 9.7 percent increase from a year ago. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering at a four-year high of 4.45 percent, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent despite the unemployment rate dropping to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
In February, there were 305,000 new homes on the market, an increase of 2.0 percent and the highest level since March 2009. The stock of new homes still remains well below its peak during the housing market bubble in 2006.

At February's sales pace it would take 5.9 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since August 2017 and up from 5.8 months in January. About two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in February after two straight monthly declines and shipments surged, which could temper expectations of a sharp slowdown in business spending on equipment in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department's report on Friday could prompt economists to raise their economic growth estimates for the first three months of the year. They were slashed last week after data showed retail sales fell in February for the third month in a row.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday painted an upbeat picture of the economy when it raised interest rates and forecast at least two more increases for 2018.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.8 percent last month. That was the biggest gain in five months and followed a downwardly revised 0.4 percent decrease in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast those orders rising only 0.8 percent in February after a previously reported 0.3 percent decline in January. Core capital goods orders increased 7.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 1.4 percent last month, the biggest advance since December 2016, after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have slipped 0.1 percent in January. Business spending on equipment powered ahead in 2017 as companies anticipated a hefty reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Trump administration slashed that rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective in January.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors worried that President Donald Trump's announcement on Thursday of tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods could start a global trade war. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were mixed while U.S. stock index futures were largely flat. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
STRONG BUSINESS SPENDING The surge in core capital goods orders in February suggests further gains. There had been concerns spending could slow sharply after double-digit growth in the past quarters. Investment in equipment is likely to be bolstered by robust business confidence, strengthening global economic growth and a weakening dollar, which is boosting demand for U.S. exports. 
That is helping to support manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity. 
The strength in core capital goods shipments, together with a surge in industrial production in February, could help offset the impact of soft consumer spending on first-quarter growth.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1.8 percent annualized rate in the first three months of the year.
The government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter. However, revisions to December data on construction spending, factory orders and wholesale inventories have suggested the fourth-quarter growth estimate could be raised to a 3.1 percent pace. The government will publish its third GDP estimate on Wednesday.
Last month, orders for machinery soared 1.6 percent. There were also hefty increases in orders of primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components. 
Orders for computers and electronic products fell 0.2 percent, with bookings for communications equipment recording their biggest drop since December 2015.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, vaulted 3.1 percent last month as demand for transportation equipment soared 7.1 percent. 

That followed a 3.5 percent tumble in January. Orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 1.6 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in January.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business confidence was expected to deteriorate slightly in the three months to March with the outlook for the coming quarter also fading, a Reuters poll found on Friday, reflecting concerns over the strong yen eroding business profits. 
The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence declining by one point to plus 25 in March, the poll of 20 economists showed.
The BOJ has revised the list of companies it surveys, while big manufacturers' business mood in December was revised up to plus 26 from 25. 
The poll showed the index of big non-manufacturers' sentiment was also down at plus 24 from a revised plus 25 in the December survey.
""We expect both big manufactures and non-manufacturers have become cautious due to factors such as a firmer yen, falls in share prices and unstable weather,"" Hideaki Kikuchi, senior economist at Japan Research Institute, said in the survey.
""The business mood among medium- to small-sized companies likely dipped as labor costs and rises in crude oil prices trimmed their profits."" 
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers forecast business conditions would worsen to plus 22 and to plus 21 respectively in the next three months, the poll found.
""There appears to be a temporary pause in the improvement of business confidence due to the yen's recent strength and higher raw material costs. But the data will likely show moderate and sustained economic expansion,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. 
Big corporations are seen raising capital spending for the fiscal year starting April by 0.6 percent, the poll found. 
Analysts say big firms will revise up their capital expenditure spending plans later thanks to brisk global demand for Japanese goods such as semiconductor products. 
The Bank of Japan will publish its tankan survey results at 8:50 a.m. on Monday April 2 (2350 GMT on April 1).
Separately, the Reuters Tankan, which closely tracks the BOJ's tankan survey, showed that confidence among Japanese manufacturers edged up in March from three months ago and the service sector's mood hit a three-year high.
The poll also found industrial production rose 5.0 percent in February from the previous month following a revised a 6.8 percent decline in January.
""There are concerns over impacts from the strong yen, trade protectionism measures by the United States and production falls in smartphones, but global economic growth will continue to support,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Research Institute in the survey.
The trade ministry will announce factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Friday March 30 (2350 GMT on March 29). 
The poll showed the Tokyo area's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, was expected to rise 0.9 percent in March from a year ago, the same as rising rate seen in February.
The jobless rate is seen higher at 2.6 percent in February and the jobs-to-applicants ratio likely improved to 1.60, which would be its highest since January 1974.
The internal affairs ministry will release the core CPI for Tokyo and jobs data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",BOJ Gets Halfway to Inflation Target as Yen Clouds Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s key inflation gauge ticked up in February, putting the Bank of Japan halfway to its goal of 2 percent. Yet a strengthening yen and the threat of a global trade war underscore the central bank’s vulnerability to global markets and events.
Despite the progress made, inflation remains far from the BOJ’s target, while the yen’s 7 percent gain so far this year has raised the risk of price gains stalling. Even a modest decline in oil prices would work against the central bank, which blamed a price collapse in 2014 for its struggles to generate inflation.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has faced questions about when the central bank will begin normalizing its monetary policy, given a growing economy and moderately rising inflation. He underscored this month that “powerful” easing will continue, even as his global peers continue to tighten policy.
""The BOJ has no choice but to patiently continue easing,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.
After stripping out external factors such as the exchange rate and oil prices, there is no confirmed inflationary trend in Japan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Tomohiro Ota wrote in a research report this week. If crude oil prices and the yen stabilize around current rates, core CPI will likely decelerate well below 1 percent from mid-year, Ota said.
""What’s creating headaches at the BOJ is the yen,"" said Nobuyasu Atago, chief economist at Okasan Securities Co. and former head of BOJ’s price-statistics division, who said core inflation could sag in the second quarter because of weaker contributions from the exchange rate and oil prices. ""I think it’s too early to be optimistic.""
To be sure, there are signs of progress in Japan’s real economy. It has expanded for eight straight quarters, and wages and domestic consumption have improved as the unemployment rate hit a 25-year low.
Japan’s recovery has largely been fueled by external demand for its products at a time of increasingly synchronized global growth. The risk is that protectionism escalates further.
""If the targeted goods widen to other products like cars, the significance of this for Japan’s economy would go up to a totally different level,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and a former BOJ official.
Trade Threat
Sumitomo Mitsui’s Kichikawa said the current estimate is for global trade to shrink enough to trim as much as 0.5 percentage point off of Japan’s real gross domestic product. ""That’s not small for a nation with a potential growth rate of around 1 percent so we’ll have to watch carefully.""
To be sure, there is a chance that trade tensions don’t escalate and that the dollar rebounds against the yen. That would relieve some pressure on the BOJ, which has faced its share of skeptics all along.
Although many see inflation slowing later this year, it should be noted a lot of economists thought core inflation wouldn’t even hit 1 percent. In a survey conducted by Bloomberg last summer, the median forecast was for core inflation to top out at 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.
""It’s true it’s been a little bit better than the market consensus,” Atago said.

The rate in early March was the lowest since February 2017. 
Mexico's central bank hiked its key interest rate to a nine-year high of 7.50 percent in February and the median of a poll this week by Banamex projected policymakers would hike again in June.
Earlier this month, Central Bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon told Reuters that policymakers did not expect significant shocks to inflation in the short term.
Data showed the annual core rate , which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, was down to 4.15 percent for the first half of March from 4.32 percent in early February, in line with expectations.

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.29 percent during the first half of March , above a forecast 0.24 percent rate, while the core price index  climbed 0.24 percent, in line with expectations.

385,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 09:46AM ET</span>",U.S. IHS Markit Composite PMI Weakens in March,"Investing.com - Business activity in the U.S. private sector weakened in March, according to preliminary data released on Thursday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 54.3 in March, from the prior reading of 55.8.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
By sectors, the research group said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 54.1 in March, from the prior month’s reading of 55.9.
Analysts had expected the reading to rise to 56.1.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Furthermore, IHS Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.7 in March from the prior month’s final reading of 55.3.
Economists had estimated that it would rise to 56.0.
Despite the slight overall weakening in business activity, IHS Markit considered the data to represent another strong increase in private sector output, together with a further solid payroll gain and elevated price pressures.
“The flash PMI surveys indicate that the economy likely continued to expand at a robust pace in March, rounding off a solid opening quarter of the year,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report. This expert said the data points to first quarter GDP growth of 2.5%.
Williamson further noted that the employment index reached a nearly three-year high along with another strong payroll rise.
“The improved hiring trend reflects buoyant optimism regarding future growth,” he commented.
“Companies’ expectations for output in the year ahead remained elevated, dipping slightly in services but surging to a three-year high in manufacturing,” this economist explained.
Additionally, Williamson noted that inflationary pressures were on the rise, with the average price charged for goods and services hitting one of its strongest rates since 2014.
“Furthermore, with factory costs showing the largest jump for seven years amid growing shortages of key inputs, inflationary pressures appear to be on the rise,” Williamson concluded."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose just marginally last week, suggesting strong job growth in March that should underpin consumer spending.
Other data on Thursday offered an upbeat assessment of the economy, echoing a similar tone struck by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday when it raised interest rates and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018. 
A gauge of future economic activity increased for a fifth straight month in February and a measure of factory output climbed this month to a three-year high. Prices of single-family homes surged in January.
""The economy appears to be well entrenched in a virtuous cycle, with seemingly little risk of being derailed in the near term,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""That bodes well for employment and household spending in the coming months.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 for the week ended March 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 210,000 during the week ended Feb. 24, which was the lowest level since December 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 225,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market, for 159 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Fed's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. The U.S. central bank said on Wednesday it expected that ""labor market conditions will remain strong.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese imports intensified concerns about a global trade war. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 223,750 last week. The claims data covered the survey period for March non-farm payrolls.
The four-week average of claims fell 1,750 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job gains. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February.
""The message of the unemployment claims data remains that companies are holding on to the labor they have and the labor market is tight,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will start boosting wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to support consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year. 
Consumer spending could also get a lift from rising home prices, which are helping to boost household wealth. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index jumped a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in January after increasing 0.4 percent in December. Home prices surged 7.3 percent in the 12 months through January.
House price inflation is being fueled by a chronic shortage of properties available for sale. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
""While this may overstate the underlying trend given that it is stronger than several other related measures, most measures of house prices show solid rates of appreciation continuing recently despite weakening in a variety of home sales measures over the past several months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Though sluggish consumer spending could hold back economic growth in the first quarter the outlook is bright. In another report, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index increased 0.6 percent in February after advancing 0.8 percent in January.

The economy's improved prospects were also underscored by a fourth report from data firm Markit showing its manufacturing sector flash PMI increased to a reading of 55.7 in March, the highest level since March 2015, from 55.3 in February. The survey showed an increase in factory employment this month.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>","Bank of England splits on rates, paving way for May rise","By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept interest rates steady on Thursday but two policymakers unexpectedly voted for a hike, reinforcing the view among economists that borrowing costs will rise in May for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis.
Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - the first BoE officials to call for rates to rise before November's increase - said it was now time to push them above the emergency level at which they have sat for most of the past decade.
The world economy is growing at its fastest rate since the financial crisis, helping Britain offset Brexit uncertainty.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis on Wednesday. Even the European Central Bank - which is still struggling with anemic price growth - has its eye on phasing out its massive bond purchases. 
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates at 0.5 percent but said ""ongoing tightening"" was likely to be needed to return inflation, which stood at 2.7 percent in February, back to its 2 percent target.
""The message from the Bank of England to borrowers couldn't really be clearer: get ready for higher rates now,"" said Ed Monk of fund managers Fidelity International.
Some investors were more equivocal. Sterling slipped after initial gains, rate-sensitive two-year gilt yields shed a couple of basis points, and longer-dated bonds yields fell to a 2018 low after the decision.
One gauge of market interest rate expectations priced in a 60 percent chance of a May rate rise, down from 70 percent before the decision, and the probability of a further rise during 2018 fell to less than 50 percent.
However, sharp falls in share prices and a global bond rally due to concerns about a trade war between the United States and China muddied the market signal.
The BoE said there could be significant economic damage if tensions over tariffs mooted by U.S. President Donald Trump developed into widespread protectionism.
But there was nothing to suggest policymakers are looking any less closely at raising rates in May.
Last month BoE Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues said rates might need to rise faster than expected. On Thursday, the BoE said developments since then broadly backed up their view.
""Given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target,"" the BoE said.
RBC economist Sam Hill said Thursday's bond yield falls should be weighed against strong gains on Wednesday, when the two-year yield ended close to its highest since 2011.
""It is very difficult to read into these minutes any clues that the MPC is trying to downplay a May rate hike,"" he said.
TIGHTENING CYCLE STARTING?
The BoE raised rates for the first time in over a decade in November, reversing an emergency cut when the economy briefly appeared to be going into shock after the June 2016 Brexit vote.
No economist polled by Reuters had expected another 25-basis-point rate rise on Thursday.
One major stumbling block to a May rate rise was removed this week when Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a 21-month transition deal with the European Union.
On Wednesday data showed pay growth at its highest since 2015. The BoE said that underscored how domestic cost pressures were building. 
However, Britain's growth outlook remains muted. The BoE expects growth of 1.8 percent this year and next, well below the historic average.
Some economists said the BoE was overlooking signs of a steeper slowdown - as forecast last week by government economists - and the wage pick-up would prove a false dawn.

""We expect no further change after May,"" HSBC economists Liz Martins and Simon Wells said. ""Despite the hawkishness of today's communications - and even if the tone in May is hawkish too - we think the Bank's intentions to tighten will be thwarted by the data.""

388,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Supermarkets and online shopping spur Feb spike in UK retail sales,"LONDON, (Reuters) - British retail sales jumped in February, although doubts remain about the underlying strength of consumer demand as the Bank of England weighs when to raise interest rates ahead of Brexit.
Retail sales volumes rose 0.8 percent from January, the Office for National Statistics said, above the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a monthly rise of 0.4 percent, and after dropping 0.2 percent in January.
Still, looking at the three months to February, which smoothes out monthly volatility in the data, sales fell 0.4 percent - the weakest growth by this measure in nearly a year after a big drop in sales in December. 
There is a risk of a further downturn in March, when snow storms brought widespread disruption across Britain.
Britain's economy underperformed its rivals last year as higher inflation - caused by the fall in the pound since June 2016's Brexit vote - hurt consumers' spending power.
The Bank of England is due to announce its March policy decision at 1200 GMT and expects the consumer squeeze to ease in 2018 as inflation cools and wage growth ticks higher.
Thursday's figures showed retail prices rose in February by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the smallest increase since January 2017.
Most economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will raise interest rates in May for only the second time since the financial crisis, spurred partly by a recovery in pay growth.
Official data on Wednesday showed overall wages rose at the fastest annual pace since mid-2015 during the three months to January.
The ONS said retail sales growth in February was driven mostly by supermarkets, as well as vehicle fuel and online shopping. Non-food retailers, which include department stores and clothes shops, suffered a fall in sales.
Some major non-food retailers have sought protection from creditors over the past couple of months, such as Toys R Us UK and electricals chain Maplin.
Compared with a year earlier, the ONS said February retail sales were up 1.5 percent versus expectations of a 1.3 percent rise, the ONS said.
Last month the BoE forecast real-terms household spending growth would slow to 1.25 percent in 2018 from 1.5 percent in 2017 as demand shifted towards business investment and exports. 

British inflation was weaker than expected in February, falling to 2.7 percent from 3.0 percent previously, as the impact from the fall in sterling after the 2016 Brexit vote faded, easing some of the squeeze on households' spending power.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence deteriorated for a second straight month in March, dropping to its lowest level in nearly a year, as managers in Europe's largest economy became more concerned about the rising threat of protectionism. 
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Thursday that its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, fell to 114.7 from 115.4 in February.
The reading, an 11-month low, undershot the expectations of analysts polled by Reuters, whose consensus forecast was 114.8.
""The threat of protectionism is dampening the mood in the German economy,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said.
German managers were less satisfied with their current business situation, which nevertheless remained at a high level, Ifo said. Firms were also less upbeat about the coming months.
""The protectionism debate is leaving its mark,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that export expectations fell to their lowest levels in more than a year.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Andreas Rees said U.S. trade policies had increased uncertainty. ""But there'll be robust growth in the months ahead - even if the German economy probably has surpassed its peak,"" Rees said.
A sector breakdown of the Ifo figures showed the main drag came from retailing and manufacturing. Business sentiment improved in construction.
The Ifo data chimed with HIS Markit's latest survey among purchasing managers, which showed growth in Germany's private sector lost a little steam in March as factory output slowed.
HIS Markit economist Chris Williamson said that the outlook for exporters had been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as the recent appreciation of the euro.
However, the overall high readings of the PMI survey also suggested that Germany's upswing is likely to continue.
""We'll probably see a strong first quarter with a growth rate of around 0.7 percent,"" Williamson said. This compares with a growth rate of 0.6 percent on the quarter in the last three months of 2017.
Economic advisers to the German government on Wednesday raised their 2018 growth forecast to 2.3 percent but warned that protectionist measures could limit the upswing.

The Ifo institute is even more optimistic, with its researchers confirming their forecasts - originally made in December - of 2.6 percent German growth this year and 2.1 percent in 2019.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone growth slows again in March on hot euro, cold weather - PMIs","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses rounded off the first quarter of 2018 with their slowest growth in over a year, much weaker than expected, as new business took another hit from a stubbornly strong euro, a survey showed.
The euro zone's economic boom had already paused in February as rising prices left a mark, and a Reuters poll earlier this month said growth had peaked, worrying for the European Central Bank as it looks to move away from an ultra-loose monetary policy. 
IHS Markit's composite flash PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to economic health, slumped to 55.3 this month, far below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted a more modest dip to 56.7 from February's final reading of 57.1.
Still, survey compiler IHS Markit said the data - despite severe weather also having an impact this month - pointed to robust first-quarter GDP growth of 0.7 percent, a touch faster than the 0.6 percent predicted in a Reuters poll.
""It certainly looks like growth has peaked around the turn of the year and we are on a slower growth trajectory now. That's not to say we are indicating any sort of downturn - we are still at elevated levels,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist.
Since the start of the year the euro is up more than 2 percent against the dollar - and is expected to strengthen further - making the bloc's goods and services more expensive for foreign buyers.
So new business growth, which does include trade within the bloc, tapered. The sub-index fell to 55.0 from 56.3, the lowest since the start of last year.
""Export growth has more than halved since December from fairly elevated levels, which coincided with the strengthening of the euro, so some of that currency effect may be taking its toll,"" Williamson said.
That also affected the bloc's dominant service industry. Its PMI sank to a five-month low of 55.0 from 56.2, also below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted a reading of 56.0.
Also likely of concern to ECB policymakers, who have failed to get inflation anywhere near their 2 percent target ceiling, the output prices index eased to 52.4 from 52.9. Consumer prices rose less than expected in February, just 1.1 percent year-on-year.
Manufacturers had a similarly softer month. The factory PMI dropped two points to 56.6 from 58.6, matching the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll. The median was for 58.1.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, plunged to a 14-month low of 56.1 from 59.6. Factory managers were also less optimistic, with the survey's future output index dropping to a 15-month low of 64.9 from 67.1.
The slowdown could be widespread, with earlier data from Germany showing growth in Europe's largest economy slowed much faster than anyone polled by Reuters had expected. A sister PMI suggested France's expansion rate had also weakened.
""It's what we might call growing pains curbing growth, especially in the fastest-growing countries ... it is then disseminating across the region,"" Williamson said.
There are no preliminary numbers for other euro zone countries.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>","China raises a key market interest rate, following Fed's move","By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China gingerly raised a key short-term interest rate on Thursday following the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's move overnight, in a symbolic reminder that Beijing is keeping an eye on global market trends even as it cracks down on financial risks at home.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it had increased the rate on 7-day reverse repurchase agreements by 5 basis points (bps) to 2.55 percent. Reverse repos are one of its most commonly used tools to control liquidity in the financial system.
The Fed raised U.S. interest rates by 25 bps, or a quarter of a percentage point, on Wednesday and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018.
The PBOC's move had been widely expected and was its first major policy decision under new Governor Yi Gang, who was appointed by parliament on Monday as part of a sweeping reshuffle of China's cabinet under ever-stronger President Xi Jinping.
""I think it's just a symbolic rate hike again to avoid the China-U.S. rate spread from widening too much,"" said Ken Cheung, senior FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.
""A 5 bps hike is enough because yuan depreciation is not a big concern. And the PBOC is refraining from lifting rates aggressively amid the regulation reform and benign inflation pressure.""
The news prompted Chinese 10-year treasury futures for June delivery  to rise as much as 0.3 percent to 93.475. By 0700 GMT the most traded contract had eased to around 93.375, up about 0.2 percent.
The PBOC also injected 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) into the financial system on Thursday.
AVOIDING A BLOW-OUT
Many market watchers had expected the PBOC to follow a Fed hike with a 5-10 bps increase in the borrowing cost for Chinese interbank loans.
That would keep the U.S.-China rate differential from getting too wide -- which would risk a resurgence in capital outflows from China.
But analysts said the move was also a signal to banks and other financial institutions that the government is pressing ahead this year with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system.
Capital Economics said in a note that it believed the rate hike was an effort by the PBOC to show it would follow the Fed to minimize outflows and prevent a yield gap blow-out.
But the consultancy added that the PBOC may revert to looser monetary conditions in coming quarters if economic activity cools more than expected.
The PBOC had similarly inched up some rates after the Fed hiked its policy rate last March and December.
It began nudging up short-term market rates and those of its other liquidity tools in early 2017 as authorities' clampdown on riskier financing practices kicked into higher gear, but it has moved cautiously to avoid a hit to the economy.
In a statement, the PBOC said the rate increase was a normal response to the Fed's move that would help shape interest rate expectations and guide ""reasonable"" growth in credit.
The PBOC also raised rates on its standing lending facility (SLF) short-term loans by 5 bps, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
FOLLOW SUIT
With global markets expecting more monetary tightening in the United States, economists think China will raise market rates again, although there is no clear consensus on how high they may go.
Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai, expected the PBOC to raise market rates by a total of 25 bps this year, but possibly as much as 50 bps if consumer inflation in China rises above 3 percent.
Economists at ANZ expect the 7-day reverse repo rate to rise another 30 bps this year as the PBOC continues with a tightening bias.
However, much of the official focus this year is expected to be on a continued tightening of the regulatory screws, with a flurry of measures already announced in the last few months.
BALANCING ACT
Some market watchers also expect the PBOC to start moving benchmark rates again, but said the move would be asymmetric, with only the deposit rate rising to haul negative real deposit rates above the water line. 
The PBOC has not changed its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates since October 2015, with the central bank preferring to guide borrowing costs via liquidity operations and interbank market rates.
""On the one hand, the PBOC needs to push up the interest rate in the domestic financial market, so as to curb domestic financial speculation and prevent capital outflow,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""On the other, given the probability of a correction in asset prices and the potential for economic slowdown, it is not an optimal choice to adjust up the benchmark deposit and lending rates. Therefore, increasing the 7-day reverse repo rate provides the PBOC with the flexibility to control market liquidity and financing costs.""
Analysts polled by Reuters expect China's GDP growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, pressured by higher borrowing costs and cooling investment in the property market. That would be in line with the government's 2018 target.

The Federal Open Market Committee increased the overnight funds rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first meeting with newly-installed Chairman Jerome Powell at the helm. Futures traders had seen an around 90% chance of a rate increase ahead of the meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Members of the rate-setting committee stuck to their median forecast for a total of three rate hikes in 2018, but revised upward their interest-rate projections for both 2019 and 2020. The central bank sees interest rates in 2019 at 2.9%, up from a prior forecast of 2.7%, while interest rates in 2020 are expected rise to 3.4%, up from a prior estimate of 3.1%.
“No fourth dot for 2018, but it’s coming, soon,” said research firm Pantheon. The research firm added that “only one FOMC member needs to add another hike to their 2018 profile to raise the median to four hikes this year.”
In a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy, members of the rate-setting committee raised their economic growth projection for this year, forecasting U.S. economic growth of 2.7% in 2018, a 0.2% increase from the previous projection of 2.5% in December.
Subdued inflation, however, continued to weigh as central bank members left their Core-PCE inflation outlook for 2018 unchanged at 1.9%. While Core-PCE Inflation for 2019 was revised higher to 2.1%, from a prior estimate of 2%. 
""It's interesting that while growth was seen improving there were only small changes in the inflation outlook,"" Bank of Montreal (BMO) said.
""Just +0.1% was added to core-PCE for 2019 and 2020, with both now at 2.10%. We're reading this as somewhat dovish because the Fed is anticipating benign inflation despite nearly 3% growth,"" BMO said.
The labor market is expected to improve in 2018, with the unemployment rate expected at 3.8%, down from a prior forecast of 3.9%. Labor market tightening in 2019 and 2020, however, is expected to ease. The central bank forecasts the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 at 3.6%, down from 3.9%, and 3.6%, down from 4%, respectively.
Recent tax cuts and government spending increases along with economic data pointing to continued strengthening in the labor market have raised questions over whether the Fed will need to raise rates more aggressively in order to allow the economy to keep expanding without overheating.
Investor focus is expected to turn to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell as he gets his press conference underway.
In his first congressional testimony as Fed chairman, Powell said the economy had been stronger this year than he expected in December and vowed to forge ahead with gradual rate increases to avoid an “overheated economy”."

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on loan requests for home purchase increased to 249.9 in the week ended March 16, which was up 1.4 percent from the prior week. The index, which is seen as proxy for future home sales, was at the highest since 255.4 in the week of Feb. 2.

The interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages, or loans with balances of $453,100 or less, averaged 4.68 percent last week. This was a tad lower than the previous week's 4.69 percent which was the highest since January 2014, MBA said.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales surge, but supply remains a headache","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rebounded strongly in February, boosted by hefty gains in the South and West regions, but a chronic shortage of houses on the market remains an obstacle heading into the spring selling season.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales jumped 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, ending two straight monthly declines.
""All signs point to a spring buying season of high prices and low inventory as any new construction that is added is snapped up quickly by buyers,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising 0.5 percent to a rate of 5.40 million units in February. Sales soared 6.6 percent in the South, where the bulk of sales activity occurs, and vaulted 11.4 percent in the West. 
Sales tumbled 12.3 percent in the Northeast and fell 2.4 percent in the Midwest. Existing home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, increased 1.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in February.
There is an acute shortage of homes, especially at the lower end of the market. According to the NAR, sales of houses priced below $100,000 plunged 17 percent from a year ago. Sales of properties in the $100,000-$250,000 price range slipped 1.0 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
The Realtors group said there was double-digit sales growth for houses costing $250,000 and above. Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 37 days in February, down from 41 days in January and 45 days a year ago. Forty-six percent of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month.
The resulting high prices from the inventory squeeze, combined with rising mortgage rates, are a constraint for first-time buyers, who have been largely priced out of the market. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at a four-year high of 4.44 percent. 
The Federal Reserve raised its interest rates on Wednesday against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and expansionary fiscal policy. The U.S. central bank forecast at least two more rate hikes this year, a sign that mortgage rates could rise further.
On Wall Street, the PHLX housing index (HGX) rallied, outperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the Fed rate decision and the Fed's economic outlook, while prices for U.S. government bonds were trading marginally lower. 
PRICES ACCELERATING
While the number of previously owned homes on the market increased 4.6 percent from the prior month to 1.59 million units in February, housing inventory was down 8.1 percent from a year ago. Supply has declined for 33 straight months on a year-on-year basis. It was the lowest February inventory on record.
At February's sales pace, it would take 3.4 months to exhaust the current inventory. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The median house price increased 5.9 percent from a year ago to $241,700 in February. That was the 72nd consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. 
House price gains far outpace wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent on an annual basis despite the unemployment rate's being at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Labor market strength is fanning demand for housing.
""This one-two punch has created a situation in which existing sales appear to be plateauing at around 5.5 million sales per year, well below the 6 million or more we might otherwise expect to see,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow.
But the supply squeeze could ease a bit in the months ahead. The government reported last Friday that the number of single-family housing units under construction surged in February to the highest level since June 2008 while completions hit an almost 10-year high.
Still, economists expect supply to remain tight this year, which together with pricey home loans could result in modest home sales growth in 2018.

First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of transactions in February, unchanged from January and down from 31 percent a year ago. Economists and Realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

LONDON (Reuters) - British workers' overall pay rose at the fastest pace in more than two years during the three months to January, bolstering the chances that the Bank of England will raise borrowing costs in May.
Sterling gained and British government bond prices fell after data showed wage growth including bonuses caught up with inflation for the first time in 10 months and employment grew more than analysts had expected. ""It's strong across the board,"" Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, said. ""This will trump any softness in yesterday's inflation numbers and will definitely reinforce expectations of a move by the BoE in May.""
Britain's economy slowed in 2017 as higher inflation - caused by the post-referendum fall in the pound - hurt the spending power of consumers, although forecasts of a bigger hit to growth were confounded and job creation was strong.
The Office for National Statistics said workers' total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.8 percent in the three months to January, the biggest increase since the three months to September 2015, after an upwardly revised 2.7 percent rise in the three months to December. 
That beat all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which had pointed to a reading of 2.6 percent.
Last month, BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane said he expected to see overall wage growth pick up from January onwards, probably reaching 3 percent at the end of the first quarter, as well as a return to wage growth in real terms.
Excluding bonuses, the pick-up in wage growth was a little more muted. Regular pay rose by 2.6 percent, as expected, following a 2.5 percent rise in the three months to December.
January is an important month for wage settlements and a survey published overnight suggested pay awards by British employers rose by the most in more than two years in the November-January period, increasing by a median annual rate of 2.5 percent. 
The expected increase in pay growth is a major reason why the BoE said in February that it expected interest rates to rise faster and to a greater extent than they had thought a few months previously. 
The BoE is expected to keep rates on hold when it announces the outcome of its March policy meeting on Thursday.
Earlier on Wednesday, the BBC reported that more than a million staff in England's National Health Service may receive pay increases of more than 6 percent over three years - something that would further add to overall wage growth.
The ONS said the number of people in work grew by 168,000 in the three months to January. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much smaller rise of 84,000.
The data also showed the unemployment rate edged back down to its four-decade low of 4.3 percent after it rose briefly to 4.4 percent. 
The number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 9,200 to 838,000 in February. The number of vacancies fell to 816,000 in the three months to February from 824,000 in the three months to January, marking the first drop in seven months.
Economists taking part in the Reuters poll had expected the number of benefit claimants to rise by 5,400. 
Separate ONS figures showed Britain's government recorded a February budget deficit of 1.3 billion pounds, slightly more than the Reuters poll consensus of 1.1 billion pounds. 
That took the deficit in the first 11 months of the current financial year to 41.4 billion pounds, down 5.7 percent from the same point a year ago. 

Last week, Britain's official budget forecasters cut their projection for the full 2017/18 financial year shortfall to 45.2 billion pounds, or 2.2 percent of GDP, the lowest since 2001/02.

The report came a day after official figures showing that annual inflation slowed in February. The shrinking gap between wages and inflation indicate that the cost of living squeeze in UK households may be coming to an end, giving the BoE more leeway to hike interest rates.
In February the bank indicated that interest rates were likely to go up more quickly than previously expected if the economy remained on its current track.

The five economists who advise the German government on policy said they expected gross domestic product to grow by 2.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage points from their previous forecast in November.
For 2019, they forecast 1.8 percent economic growth.
The Ifo economic institute was even more optimistic, with its researchers confirming their forecasts -- originally made in December -- of 2.6 percent German growth this year and 2.1 percent in 2019.
""Huge income tax reductions in the USA and the robust economic upturn in the euro zone are boosting demand for German goods and services,"" Ifo said on Wednesday.
The panel of economic advisors said trade would play a slightly bigger role as a growth driver than previously expected due to a booming world economy. The European Central Bank's loose monetary policy and the government's plans to increase state spending will provide additional stimulus, they added.
But the advisors also warned that the German economy was facing increased risks from abroad, including the Italian election result, uncertainty regarding the outcome of negotiations on Britain's looming departure from the European Union and planned U.S. import tariffs.
""A spiral of protectionist measures would have a clear negative impact on the global economy and the German economy,"" they said. 
On the domestic front, German companies are facing increased capacity constraints and labor shortages are likely to limit future growth, the panel said.
In an interview with Stern magazine, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz warned U.S. President Donald Trump's administration against using ""instruments of the 19th century"", saying Trump talked about fairness but really meant protectionism.
""Protectionism hurts everyone -- even those who start it,"" Scholz said of the United States, which is planning tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
Ifo said the debate about introducing or raising tariffs in transatlantic trade, along with the euro's appreciation, was dampening morale among companies.
The coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc and the Social Democrats -- sworn in earlier this month -- is having a temporary stimulative effect because it has agreed to boost state spending, particularly in the coming year, Ifo said.
Ifo said the government's tax reform plans were disappointing, however, and an answer was still needed to a significant reduction in corporate tax rates in the United States as well as in France and Britain.
The German economy grew by 2.2 percent in 2017 which translated into a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent -- the strongest growth rate since 2011.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Business confidence among Asian companies rose in the first quarter to the highest level in seven years, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed, as a fresh surge by the Chinese economy offset concerns about rising trade barriers.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index , representing the six-month outlook of 67 firms, advanced one notch to 79 for the January-March quarter compared with three months before.
A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
""The improvement is not dramatic but with a historical perspective this is a good reading,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia saw robust jumps in sentiment, showing that many countries in Asia continue to benefit from accelerating global growth. In particular, China has seen exports soar, up 45 percent in February to mark their fastest growth in three years.

""China ... has escaped the fear of a crisis that started back in 2016 and that's why you see strong confidence. Imbalances persist but there is no real threat of a crisis over the short term,"" said Fatas.
The subindex for Thailand surged to 100 from 85 and the Philippines saw a climb to 83 from 70 while sentiment in Malaysia improved five notches to 75.
""The tourism and export sector expansion will help drive growth (in Thailand) this year,"" said Rattham Somboonchareon, a planning manager at survey respondent  Thai Airways  (BK:THAI), adding that government spending was also a key driver of growth.
Australia's subindex dropped to 80 from 92, although the figure is relatively high when compared with its historical average of 69.
While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have raised their global growth forecasts for this year due to strong trade, consumer spending, and investment in many major economies, intensifying rhetoric in favor of protectionism has become a major concern.
U.S. President Donald Trump has announced import tariffs on steel and aluminum, and is expected to consider additional tariffs targeted specifically at China. He has also repeatedly said the U.S. free-trade deal with South Korea is ""unfair"" and has threatened to scrap it altogether on multiple occasions.
That has battered sentiment in South Korea, with the country's subindex plunging to 50 from 83.
""There is a sense among Korean businesses that Trump will continue to be aggressive against their country,"" said Fatas.
Singapore's subindex declined to 75 from 79. The country's exports took a surprise dip in February as tech product shipments continued to retreat from the hot pace of recent months.
Japan, where consumer spending numbers have been subdued, recorded its lowest reading in a year, at 67 compared to the fourth-quarter's 70. India also experienced a decline in sentiment, falling to 72 from 79.
The index for sentiment in China increased to 88 from 83, but the number of respondents was low at four companies.
Increasing trade friction and higher interest rates were cited as the biggest concerns in the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey.
By industry, the technology, construction, energy and metals sectors expressed concern about trade friction, showed the survey, which was conducted March 2-16.
Sectors which identified rising interest rates as a risk included the energy, real estate, retail and technology sectors. The energy sector also showed concern about the potential for a sudden asset price correction.
The auto sector matched its highest subindex reading posted seven years ago, while the retail and leisure sector recorded its best ever reading. Healthcare had its highest score in two years.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors deteriorated in March, a survey showed on Tuesday, reflecting growing uncertainty about the damage Europe's largest economy could suffer if U.S. import tariffs escalated into a bitter trade conflict.
U.S. President Donald Trump has announced import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, which take effect on Friday. That has raised concerns about tit-for-tat measures that could spiral into a global trade dispute and hurt the economic recovery.
The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors dropped to 5.1, its lowest reading in a year and a half, from 17.8 in the previous month. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll was for 13.0.
""Concerns over an U.S.-led global trade conflict have made the experts more cautious in their prognoses,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
The stronger euro is also hampering the business outlook of German exporters, Wambach said, adding that the outlook for the economy as a whole remained ""largely positive"" despite the risks.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged down to 90.7 from 92.3 last month. That was slightly higher than the 90.0 predicted in the Reuters consensus forecast.
Germany's economy ministry has warned that any escalation of Trump's tariffs on metal imports into a full-blown trade war could damage the global recovery, although the tariffs themselves should have only limited effect.
But Trump has also warned the European Union it would get hit with a ""big tax of 25 percent on their cars"" for not treating the United States well when it comes to trade.
This has alarmed Germany's carmakers, who have urged policymakers to avoid a trade war ""at all costs"". The United States is one of the biggest markets for German cars, which are the country's biggest source of export income.

Economists estimate that a full-blown trade war between the United States, China and Europe could cut economic growth in Germany by up to 1 percentage point.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 06:54AM ET</span>",UK inflation slows in February as Brexit hit to pound fades,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation was weaker than expected in February as the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote faded, easing some of the squeeze on households' spending power but doing little to change bets on a Bank of England rate rise in May.
Official data showed consumer prices rose by an annual 2.7 percent last month, the weakest increase since July of last year and down from a rise of 3.0 percent in January.
The figure was slightly below the median forecast of 2.8 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
Investors saw the softening of inflation as unlikely to challenge the BoE's message from last month that interest rates will probably need to rise more quickly than it had previously thought.
British inflation is running at more than double the rate in Germany and France. It is also higher than in the United States, where the Federal Reserve looks set to continue its series of interest rate hikes this week.
""This fallback in inflation therefore provides little reason for the Bank of England to hold back from gradually raising interest rates,"" said Andrew Sentance, a former BoE rate-setter who is now an economic adviser with accountancy firm PwC.
""The UK recovery is now nearly nine years old, and yet our official interest rate is exactly where it was nine years ago.""
Sterling weakened after the data but held on to most of its 1 percent jump from Monday, when Britain secured a Brexit transition deal from the European Commission, something the BoE is likely to see as adding to the case for a rate hike in May.
Tuesday's figures also suggested less pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by the least since November 2016 as the cost of their raw materials -- many of them imported -- rose by 3.4 percent, way down from a peak annual increase of nearly 20 percent in January last year.
PEAK PASSED
Inflation climbed in Britain to as high as 3.1 percent in November, pushed up by voters' June 2016 decision to leave the European Union, which hammered the value of the pound and made imports more expensive. 
There are signs that the Brexit hit to prices has peaked, however, though the BoE expects a residual impact to last years. 
February's slowdown in part reflected how prices jumped in the same month last year. 
""Many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system,"" ONS statistician Phil Gooding said.
Petrol prices fell on the month and food prices rose more slowly than in February 2017, he said.
Also pushing down on inflation was a slower rise in the price of ferry tickets, which last year were monitored over Valentine's Day when many people could have been taking breaks, the ONS said.
Furthermore, sterling has strengthened in recent months on signs that Britain will avoid a disorderly Brexit.
Despite the fall in inflation, many households are still feeling pressure in their budgets. 
ONS figures due to be published on Wednesday are expected to show that pay growth edged up to an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the three months to January. 
The BoE expects wages to grow more quickly than inflation later this year. It is widely expected to say on Thursday that it will keep rates on hold for now, and stick with a plan to raise borrowing costs only gradually.

It increased interest rates in November for the first time in more than a decade.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' mood suggests upbeat BOJ survey: Reuters Tankan,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers edged up in March from three months ago and the service sector's mood hit a three-year high, the Reuters Tankan poll showed on Tuesday, signaling solid readings in the central bank's closely-watched quarterly tankan survey.
But the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ)tankan due out April 2, found manufacturers' and non-manufacturers' sentiment was likely to decline over the coming three months, adding uncertainty to the outlook.
Solid tankan readings should support the BOJ's optimistic economic view. But the central bank is in no mood to exit its easy money policy anytime soon, despite the economy's strong performance, with inflation still far below its 2 percent target.
Economists expect business sentiment to remain at high levels on the back of economic recovery at home and overseas. But risks such as protectionism stemming from U.S. trade policy, its impact on currencies, and a potential correction to the booming semiconductor market will weigh on the outlook.
In the Reuters poll of 542 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 261 firms responded on condition of anonymity, some manufacturers said they have had a boost from global demand for electronics, while others complained about the high cost of raw materials and rises in the yen that dented exporters' profits.
""The yen's gains and declines in share prices may affect business with a lag, but so far they have not had much impact,"" a manager of an electrical appliance maker wrote in the survey on condition of anonymity.
""We are receiving solid inquiries about capital expenditure from our client manufacturers, with outstanding orders remaining elevated,"" the manager added.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 28, down from the previous month's 29, according to the survey conducted March 1-15. Compared with three months ago, the index was up one point, suggesting slight improvement in the upcoming BOJ tankan.
The service-sector index rose to 35 from 33 in the previous month, driven by gains in retailers as well as information/communications firms. It was the best reading since June 2015.
The service-sector index was up one point versus three months ago, auguring well for the BOJ tankan.
The manufacturers' and service-sector indexes are expected to fall to 25 and 29 respectively in June.
The BOJ's last tankan in December showed big manufacturers' confidence improved for a fifth straight quarter to hit an 11-year high, signaling broadening economic recovery from solid external demand and hefty corporate profits. 

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

Rightmove's figure is not seasonally adjusted and contrasts with a much more subdued picture painted so far this year by mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide, whose property valuations have risen at the weakest annual pace since 2013.
""It remains to be seen if this month's 11-year price rise high for March is a catch-up anomaly after two more-subdued months, or an early sign of price pressure building up a real head of steam,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.
Asking prices in the first quarter of 2018 as a whole were 3.0 percent higher than at the end of 2017, a bigger seasonal increase than in early 2017 but less than in 2016, when property tax changes encouraged sales in the early part of the year.
Rightmove said prices were boosted by a 5 percent fall in the number of properties being offered for sale compared with a year earlier, and said some buyers might be trying to complete purchases before the Bank of England raises interest rates.
Although Britain's economy slowed last year as higher inflation ate into consumer demand, most economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to raise interest rates in May due to concerns that above-target inflation will be slow to fall. 

On Friday the BoE said there had been a rise in the proportion of mortgages being issued that just below 4.5 times a borrower's income - the upper limit of what it deems safe.

The average price of new homes in 70 cities grew 0.2% m/m in February, compared with a 0.06% m/m decrease in January. Compared with the same period from last year, they rose 5.2% in February, versus a 5.0% gain in January, the NBS data showed.
However, the data also indicated that the country’s home prices rose in fewest cities in five months, as the government’s campaign to curb housing market speculation started to bear fruit.
Earlier this month, an NPC spokesman said the authority was in the process of drafting a property tax bill, while the country’s top banking regulator again called for more measures to reduce household debt.
Among the four top-tier cities, home prices slipped 0.3% on-year in Beijing, 0.6% in Shanghai and 2.5% in Shenzhen, although prices rose 3.1% in Guangzhou. 
Home price growth began to slow down in the second half of 2017 as the government imposed several measures to deal with the bubbles in its property markets, following rapid expansions that lasted more than two years.
Nanchong, a lower-tier city of about 6 million in Southwestern China’s Sichuan province, recorded the fastest price gain as it saw a 1.7% m/m growth in new home prices in February.
Price growth in tier-3 cities in general was unchanged from January, the NBS said, without giving details.
44 cities reported higher prices in February, down from January’s 52.
Shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers fell following the report.  Evergrande  Real Estate (HK:3333) plunged 2.7%,  China Vanke  Co Ltd (HK:2202) dropped 1.9% and  Country Garden  Holdings Company Ltd (HK:2007) fell 2.2%.

New-home prices, excluding government-subsidized housing, gained in 44 of 70 cities tracked, compared with 52 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. Prices fell in 16 cities from the previous month and were unchanged in 10. The increase is the fewest since September, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The slower growth comes as authorities sent a stronger signal at the National People’s Congress on efforts to curb property speculation and tame runaway prices. Earlier this month, an NPC spokesman said a property tax bill is being drafted, and the head of the nation’s banking regulator again called for steps to reduce household debt. That followed home-buying restrictions in at least 125 cities, according to data provider Fang Holdings Ltd.
“As long as President Xi Jinping wants deleveraging of the economy, I think the property market is on a long-term downward trend,” Andy Xie, an independent analyst and a former chief Asia economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), told Bloomberg TV.
Chinese developers fell in Hong Kong trading. China Evergrande Group shares fell 2.7 percent, China Vanke Co. dropped 1.9 percent and and Country Garden Holdings Co. declined 2.2 percent.
Top cities led the price declines, leading values to drop from a year ago. Prices in Shenzhen had the biggest decline in three quarters, falling 0.6 percent from a year earlier. Values slid 0.4 percent in Guangzhou, 0.3 percent in Beijing and 0.2 percent in Shanghai.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 03:49AM ET</span>",China's new home price growth slows as big cities decline,"By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee
(Reuters) - China's new home price growth slowed in February from the previous month as a raft of government curbs aimed at tempering speculative demand softened prices in the biggest cities, although strength seen in smaller centers remained intact.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.2 percent in February from the previous month, compared with an increase of 0.3 percent in January, Reuters' calculations from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Monday showed.
Compared with a year ago, they rose 5.2 percent in the month, picking up from a 5.0 percent increase in January.
Prices fell in China's top-tier cities after they stabilized in January, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the data, without giving a specific figure.
Shenzhen's new home prices fell 0.6 percent month-on-month, after it stabilized in January. Beijing prices declined 0.3 percent after posting a 0.2 percent increase in the previous month, data showed.
""I think the policies currently in place (to curb speculation) are effective in a way that they made prices fall slightly in prime markets,"" said ING economist Iris Pang.
""But they also result in a spillover effect that drives buyers who can't afford in those big cities to less expensive markets, which will continue to push up prices,"" she said, adding that she doesn't expect significant price falls in the biggest cities, despite the curbs.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes although the number has dropped from the previous month. Forty-four cities reported higher prices in February, down from January's 52.
The declines in the four top-tier cities contrast with a steady rise in prices in China's vast spread of smaller cities. The fastest price gain was seen in Nanchong, a lower-tier city of about 6 million in Southwestern China's Sichuan province, where values of new homes rose 1.7 percent on-month in February.
Price growth in tier-3 cities in general was unchanged from January, the NBS said, without giving details. 
China removed sales prices for affordable housing in its January calculations, which prevents like-for-like comparisons with growth data before 2018. 
Home price growth began to slow in the second half of 2017 as the government sought to deal with bubbles in its property markets, following almost two years of rapid expansion.
Property sales have shown signs of easing in recent months despite expectations of a spike in demand as developers ramp up promotions during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays when migrant workers head home.
But analysts have remained optimistic about demand in smaller tier-3 and tier-4 cities thanks to favorable government policies aimed at reducing inventories.
Authorities are seeking to balance attempts to support real economic activity with efforts to rein in risks from an increasingly complex financial system. 
Household loans - mainly mortgages - increased by 275.1 billion yuan in February, well below expectations and sharply down on January's record of 901.6 billion yuan.
On Monday, Chinese housing minister Wang Menghui said the government would step up property market regulation and fight off illegal conduct by property firms and intermediaries.
Policymakers have vowed to push the stable and healthy development of the property market this year, emphasizing that homes are for living in, not speculative investment.
China will focus more on providing affordable housing and developing the rental market, Premier Li Keqiang announced earlier this month.

The country is also steadily pushing for a property tax law this year and expect it completed by 2020.

Key Takeaways
The continued growth in exports suggest the global recovery remains firm, and sales to China should bounce back after the decline caused by the holidays. Yet a stronger yen poses some risks to the Japanese economy by making exports less competitive and weighing on inflation by reducing the price of imports. The chances of a trade war breaking out due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs is another potential source of downside for Japan.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 10:45PM ET</span>","Japan exports slow on Lunar New Year holidays, uptrend intact","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose for a 15th straight month in February but slowed sharply from the prior month as shipments stalled because of Lunar New Year holidays - an event analysts dismissed as a one-off blip in the context of solid overseas demand.
""The Lunar New Year distortion caused a severe slowdown in February, but the increasing trend remained intact. Japan's exports are maintaining a rising trend reflecting the global economy's high growth and the outlook is expected to keep rising,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
Analysts expect solid global demand for semiconductors and electronics will support the expansion in exports, but they also worry that U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs on steel and aluminum could spark a trade war.
""Based on the firm trend in overseas machinery orders and the elevated level of business sentiment globally, we see a solid outlook for exports,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showed exports grew 1.8 percent, roughly in line with a 1.9 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 12.3 percent rise in January.
In volume terms, Japan's exports fell 2.1 percent in February from a year ago, the first drop in 13 months, the data showed.
SMBC Nikko Securities' Maruyama estimated that real exports grew 3.6 percent on average in January and February combined, up by 1.3 percentage point from the previous quarter, with exports on track for an eighth consecutive quarter of growth in January-March. 
By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, fell 9.7 percent year-on-year in February, the trade data showed.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's exports, declined 3.2 percent in the year to February.
Shipments to the United States rose 4.3 percent in the year to February, driven by hybrid cars. Automobile shipments to the United States jumped 12.3 percent.
The trade data suggested that net trade may have weighed on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the current quarter, but some economists expected a rebound in export volumes in March.
""Today's trade figures will not deter those in the U.S. government who want to erect additional barriers to trade,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose an annual 3.4 percent in February to 631 billion yen ($5.94 billion) - the first gain in three months - at a time when Trump seeks bilateral deals to fix trade imbalances under his ""America First"" policy.
Trump pressed ahead earlier this month with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, describing the dumping of these products in the U.S. market as ""an assault on our country"". [nL4N1QQ1M8]
Japan's overall imports rose 16.5 percent in the year to February, broadly matching the median estimate of a 17.1 percent increase, led by imports of clothing from China and rising costs of crude oil and liquefied natural gas.
The overall trade balance came to a surplus of 3.4 billion yen, versus the median estimate of a 99.6 billion yen deficit.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings surge to record high in January,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings jumped to a record high in January, but a persistent lag in hiring suggested that employers will probably have to raise wages to attract qualified workers. 
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Friday underscored labor market strength and supported expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates a bit more aggressively this year than is currently anticipated.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 645,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.3 million. That was the highest level since the data series started in December 2000 and pushed the job openings rate up four-tenths of a percentage point to 4.1 percent. 
""We believe employers are going to have to pay up to fill the openings, leading to stronger wage growth and sustained consumer spending increases,"" said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities at Lazard Asset Management in New York. 
Wage growth has remained moderate despite the unemployment rate falling to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Economists expect wage increases to pick up in the second-half of the year, which should lift inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target. 
Many economists believe the U.S. central bank will at some point raise its forecast to four interest rate hikes in 2018 from three, because of sustained labor market strength and economic growth. Fed officials meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, and are expected to increase borrowing costs at the end of that meeting.
The surge in job openings was broad-based. There were 215,000 additional vacancies in the professional and business services industries. Transportation, warehousing and utilities had 113,000 more job openings and construction companies had an additional 101,000 unfilled positions. 
QUITS RATE FALLS
Hiring rose to 5.6 million in January from 5.5 million in December. The hiring rate edged up one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February.
""There is now a record 0.94 job openings per unemployed person,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Other details of the JOLTS report were mixed. The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs fell 69,000 to 3.3 million in January. The quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, slipped to 2.2 percent in January from 2.3 percent the prior month.
Economists believe that modest wage growth is hindering the mobility of workers. 
""Mobility and wage growth can be a chicken or egg type of problem. Without those increased wage offers, workers don't have a reason to change jobs,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. 
""It will be interesting to see what strategy employers use to fill these 6.3 million job openings. Will they tap into some hidden labor market slack, or will they start to recruit from other firm's workforces?""

Layoffs rose 107,000 to 1.8 million in January, lifting the layoffs rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent. Despite the rise, which was driven by the construction and leisure and hospitality industries as well as the healthcare and social assistances sector, layoffs remain very low.

424,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Hits Highest Level Since 2004,"Investing.com – U.S. consumer sentiment rose in March, according to a report published on Friday.
The preliminary publication of the data for February from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment rose to 102.0 last month.
That was compared to February’s reading of 99.7.
Analysts had forecast a drop to 99.3.
The current conditions indicator increased to 122.8 in March, from the previous 114.9.
Economists had projected that the index would fall to 114.5.
Furthermore, consumer expectations slipped to 88.6 in March, from the prior reading of 90.0.
That missed consensus that had expected a drop to just 89.8.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose to 2.9% from 2.7%, while the five-year gauge was unchanged at 2.5%.
Chief economist Richard Curtin noted that the reading on consumer sentiment hit its highest level since 2004 due to a new all-time record favorable assessment of current economic conditions.
“All of the gain in the Sentiment Index was among households with incomes in the bottom third (+15.7), while the economic assessments of those with incomes in the top third posted a significant monthly decline (-7.3),” Curtin said in the report.
The decline among upper income consumers was focused on the outlook for the economy and their personal finances,” this economist explained.
The report revealed that favorable mentions of the tax reform legislation were offset by unfavorable references to the tariffs on steel and aluminum-each was spontaneously cited by one-in-five consumers.
With regard to price stability, near term inflation expectations jumped to their highest level in several years, while interest rates were expected to increase by the largest proportion since 2004.
“These trends have prompted consumers to more favorably cite buying as well as borrowing in advance of those expected increases,” Curtin mentioned.
“While income gains are still anticipated, the March survey found that the size of the expected income increase returned to the lows recorded in the past year”, he added.
Curtin pointed out that, among the top-third income households, income expectations fell more and inflation expectations rose more.
“As these households account for more than half of all consumption expenditures, the data suggest that the relative lull in consumption in the first quarter may persist for another quarter,” Curtin concluded."

Manufacturing output rose 1.2 percent, the biggest gain since October, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent rise in industrial production. Output for January was revised down to a decline of 0.3 percent from the previous 0.1 percent drop.
The U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
February's increase in output was driven by a 2.3 percent rise in construction supplies and a recovery in the output of business equipment, which had stalled in the prior three months.
The utilities index fell nearly 5 percent after a wave of unseasonably warm weather reduced demand for heating.
Manufacturing output edged up 1.2 percent and mining production surged 4.3 percent. 
In the 12 months through February overall industrial output rose 4.4 percent. 
The percentage of industrial capacity in use rose 0.7 percentage point in February to 78.1 percent, the highest since January 2015.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 02:13PM ET</span>",U.S. industrial output soars; housing starts fall,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production surged in February, boosted by strong increases in output at factories and mines, but the economic outlook for the first quarter was dimmed by a larger-than-expected plunge in homebuilding last month.
The broad-based rise in production likely reflected increased investment spending in the wake of hefty corporate income tax cuts, which came into effect in January. Economists, however, worried tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by President Donald Trump last week could weigh on output.
""Much of manufacturing is a user of steel and aluminum,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The policy to impose tariffs poses potential risks to the broader output gain given how important trade is to manufacturing.""
Industrial production jumped 1.1 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. That was the largest increase in four months and followed a 0.3 percent decline in January. February's increase beat economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent gain.
Manufacturing output vaulted 1.2 percent, the biggest gain since October, after falling 0.2 percent in January. Production of primary metals, which include steel and aluminum increased 0.5 percent last month after jumping 1.5 percent in January.
Output of fabricated metal products, which use steel and aluminum, climbed 1.6 percent in February after rising 0.4 percent in the prior month.
Production at mines shot up 4.3 percent last month, boosted by an 11.6 percent surge in oil and gas well drilling. The robust gains in manufacturing and mining production offset a weather-driven 4.7 percent plunge in utilities output.
Industrial capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.7 percentage point to 78.1 percent, its highest reading since January 2015. It remains 1.7 percentage points below its long-run average. 
Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilization measures as a signal of how much slack remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary. Capacity use at factories rose to its highest level since April 2008.
""It has now broken out above the 20-year average. Is this a sign of more meaningful price pressure ahead?"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Steadily rising price pressures and a tightening labor market are seen giving the Fed ammunition to raise interest rates next Wednesday.
The dollar was little moved by the data as speculation that more top Trump administration officials could be ousted from the White House hurt investor sentiment. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading marginally lower and stocks on Wall Street rose.
HOMEBUILDING FALLS
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts declined 7.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.236 million units as a plunge in the construction of multi-family housing units offset a second straight monthly increase in single-family projects.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a 1.290 million-unit rate. Permits for future home building decreased 5.7 percent to a rate of 1.298 million units in February.
While the volatile multi-family housing segment accounted for the decline in home building last month, the broader housing market appears to be slowing. Sales of new and previously owned homes have slumped in recent months as a dearth of properties boosted prices, sidelining some first-time home buyers. 
House price gains topped 6.0 percent in December. Mortgage rates have also risen, with the 30-year fixed-rate currently averaging 4.44 percent, not too far from a four-year high of 4.46 percent, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
But the housing market remains underpinned by a robust labor market. There is growing optimism that tightening job market conditions will translate into faster wage growth in the second half of this year. Annual wage growth has been stuck below 3.0 percent even as the unemployment rate has dropped to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 2.9 percent to a rate of 902,000 units in February. Single-family home construction rose in the Northeast, South and West, but tumbled in the Midwest.
Permits to build single-family homes slipped 0.6 percent in February to an 872,000 unit-pace. With permits lagging starts, single-family home construction could slow in the months ahead.
A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders dipping in March, but remaining in strong territory. Builders were less upbeat about sales and buyer traffic over the next six months.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment tumbled 26.1 percent to a rate of 334,000 units in February, the lowest level since September 2017. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 14.8 percent to a 426,000 unit-pace.
But there was some good news in the report. Single-family house completions surged to their highest level since March 2008. The number of single-family housing units under construction in February was the most since June 2008. 
This should help to alleviate some of the property shortage and probably slow the house price inflation.
""The tide appears to be turning somewhat, with completions of single-family homes trending higher over the past year,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

""Profits margins are still being crimped, however, and affordability is being constrained further by higher mortgage rates.""

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 0.2 percent month-on-month and 1.1 percent year-on-year. Economists polled by Reuters had expected that monthly increase, but forecast a 1.2 percent annual rise, in line with Eurostat's own earlier estimate.
Unprocessed food prices fell 0.3 percent month-on-month in February for a 0.9 percent year-on-year decline, which subtracted 0.07 points from the overall final annual figure.
Energy prices also fell 0.3 percent on the month for a 2.1 percent year-on-year rise, slowing from 2.2 percent in January.
Without these two most volatile components, a measure the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices rose 0.3 percent on the month and 1.2 percent year-on-year, the same annual rate as in January.
Some economists look at an inflation measure that excludes even more volatile components, like alcohol and tobacco prices which are often subject to government changes in excise tax.
This measure of inflation showed prices rising 0.4 percent month-on-month and 1.0 percent year-on-year, also unchanged from the January rate.
The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to 2 percent year-on-year over the medium-term and has been buying tens of billions of euro zone government bonds on the secondary market to pump cash into the banking system and provoke bigger credit action that would boost economic growth and inflation.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said that core inflation has yet to show ""convincing signs of a sustained upward trend"" because of slack in the labor market and the economy. 

Data on labor costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 released separately by Eurostat confirmed that analysis: the growth of labor costs eased for a second consecutive quarter to 1.5 percent in Oct-Dec 2017, although wage costs rose 1.7 percent, from 1.6 percent in the third quarter.

The other think-tank, IHS, raised its GDP growth forecast for 2018 to 2.8 percent from the 2.7 percent it announced three months ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries declined for a third straight month, as China's fell to a six-month low, data from the Treasury Department showed on Thursday, hurt by rising interest rates that have eroded the value of their investment.
Their holdings of U.S. government bonds and notes fell to $6.26 trillion in January, down $24.5 billion from $6.28 trillion the previous month.
Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York said this has been an ongoing trend as higher interest rates have made holding U.S. Treasuries more expensive on a currency-hedged basis.
With the Federal Reserve already tightening U.S. monetary policy and other central banks yet to start, yields on U.S. Treasuries are trading at a wide premium over their counterparts.
Analysts said hedging costs, which have sharply increased the past few months, have nullified the yield advantage offered by U.S. Treasuries.
(GRAPHIC: China, Japan Holdings of U.S. Treasuries - http://reut.rs/2DFLnLD)
In addition, the decline in foreign demand was also partly due to central banks tapering off their bond purchase program. 
The sell-off in Treasuries contributed to the overall rise in yields in January. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) started the month at 2.465 percent and ended at 2.720 percent.
Late on Thursday, U.S. 10-year yields were at 2.829 percent.
Data also showed China's holdings of Treasuries declined to $1.168 trillion in January, their lowest in six months. China remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
Analysts said U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to slap stiff tariffs on imported steel has fueled fears that some trading partners such as China and Japan might retaliate by dumping U.S. Treasuries.
Japan, meanwhile, was the second-largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries, with $1.065 trillion in January, slightly up from $1.061 trillion in December, according to the data. Prior to January's rise, Japan holdings of the U.S. asset have fallen for five straight months.
U.S. stocks, meanwhile, saw inflows of $34.45 billion in January, the largest since May 2007. Foreigners bought U.S. equities for five straight months. The inflows were in line with record levels for U.S. stocks indexes last year.
Data further showed that offshore investors purchased $62.1 billion in long-term U.S. assets after buying a revised $23.3 billion in December. Including shorter-dated securities, overseas bought $119.7 billion in January, after selling a revised $122.5 billion in December.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian household debt as a share of income remained near a record high in the fourth quarter, even as interest rates began to rise last year, while home sales fell in February as tighter mortgage rules hit demand.
The ratio of debt to disposable income dipped to 170.4 percent from a record 170.5 percent in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said on Thursday. The third quarter was revised downward from an initial 171.1 percent.
The Bank of Canada - which regularly expresses concerns about Canadians' debt levels - has raised rates three times since July and says it is closely monitoring consumers for signs of stress. 
Much of consumers' debt has gone into the housing market, prompting local governments and regulators to take steps to address surging home prices and concerns Canadians may not be able to handle higher borrowing costs.
Canadian home resales fell 6.5 percent in February from January to the lowest level in nearly five years after home buyers rushed to get into the market late last year ahead of tighter mortgage rules that took effect in January, the Canadian Real Estate Association said.
The drop in sales over the past two months suggests the new stress tests for potential buyers are keeping some out of the market or forcing them to purchase smaller homes, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""From the Bank of Canada's perspective, we know that they're looking at what's happening with housing very cautiously,"" Kavcic said. ""They're still probably getting a yellow light on this front.""
Sales were down in almost three-quarters of the housing markets, including the major cities of Vancouver and Toronto, the real estate group said. 
On an annual basis, gains in national home prices continued to decelerate, with the home price index up 6.9 percent from a year ago, the smallest annual increase since October 2015.
The report from Statistics Canada showed households borrowed C$26.0 billion ($20.0 billion) in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from C$23.5 billion in the preceding quarter. Mortgage borrowing grew to C$16.0 billion from C$15.3 billion, the first rise after five consecutive declines.
Separate data from payrolls processor ADP showed Canada added 32,700 jobs in February, driven by increased hiring in the healthcare, trade and construction sectors.
Last week's more closely watched jobs report from Statistics Canada showed employers added 15,400 positions in February.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market tightening, inflation gaining steam","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to sustained labor strength even as economic growth appears to have slowed early in the first quarter.
Other data on Thursday showed an increase in the prices of imported goods in February amid weakness in the U.S. dollar and rising commodity prices, bolstering expectations that inflation will pick up this year. 
Import prices are likely to rise further after President Donald Trump last week imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries.
Labor market strength and a steady increase in price pressures could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its March 20-21 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases for this year, but some economists believe it will raise its projection to four hikes at the meeting.
""The strong willingness of companies to hold onto labor is a strong signal of the difficulty of replacing workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""At this point we would expect another robust gain in jobs (in March) and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.0 percent.""
The economy created 313,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 226,000 for the week ended March 10, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 210,000 during the week ended Feb. 24, the lowest level since December 1969.
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market, for 158 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Fed officials consider the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment. 
Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will boost wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to underpin consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year. 
The government reported on Wednesday that retail sales fell in February for a third straight month. Data on home sales, business spending on equipment and industrial production in January have also been weak. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as 1.7 percent at an annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter, the government reported last month. 
But revisions to December data on construction spending, factory orders and inventories have suggested the fourth-quarter growth estimate could be raised to a 3.1 percent pace. The government will publish its third GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter later this month.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) was stronger against a basket of currencies in midday trading. U.S. government bond prices were slightly weaker and U.S. stock indexes rose as industrial stocks mounted a recovery after three days of losses.
SKILLS MISMATCH
Diminishing labor market slack is also expected to help boost inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target. Manufacturing surveys from the New York Fed and Philadelphia Fed published on Thursday showed a mixture of tightening labor market conditions and rising prices for inputs.
The Philadelphia Fed said firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported difficulties finding skilled workers, especially those with specific machine and tool skills. It said more than half the firms were raising wages to address the shortages.
The New York Fed's ""Empire State"" survey showed manufacturers in New York state continuing to pay more for inputs, with the survey's prices paid index rising this month to its highest level since March 2012.
The firming inflation trend was corroborated by a fourth report from the Labor Department showing import prices rising 0.4 percent last month after accelerating 0.8 percent in January.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in import prices to 3.5 percent from January. Prices for imported capital goods jumped 0.6 percent in February, the biggest increase since April 2008, after being unchanged in January.
Prices of imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.5 percent, the largest gain since January 2014, after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month. These price increases likely reflected the dollar's depreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, and will eventually filter through to core producer and consumer inflation.
The dollar has lost 9.1 percent of its value on a trade-weighted basis since January 2017. Imported iron and steel prices increased 2.2 percent last month and were up 12.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. The cost of imported aluminum rose 0.4 percent, pushing the annual increase to 10.3 percent.
Trump slapped tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.

""Leading up to the March announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, import prices for both metals were already up by double-digits this past year,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York. ""Assuming tariffs are limited to aluminum and steel, we expect only a marginal effect on final consumer prices.""

The Labor Department said on Thursday that import prices increased 0.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.8 percent surge in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices climbing 0.2 percent in February after a previously reported 1.0 percent jump in January.
In the 12 months through February, import prices increased 3.5 percent after rising 3.4 percent in the 12 months through January.
Data this week showed steady gains in consumer and producer prices in January. Economists expect inflation will accelerate this year, driven by a tightening labor market, weaker dollar and fiscal stimulus. Inflation has undershot the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
Last month, prices for imported capital goods jumped 0.6 percent. That was the biggest increase since April 2008 and followed an unchanged reading in January.
Prices of imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.5 percent, the largest gain since January 2014, after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month. These price increases likely reflected the dollar's depreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners. 
These higher prices will eventually filter through to core producer and consumer inflation. Imported petroleum prices fell 0.5 percent, the first drop in seven months, after rising 3.0 percent in January. Import prices excluding petroleum surged 0.5 percent after a similar gain in January.
The price of goods imported from China rose 0.2 percent. Prices for imports from China increased 0.3 percent in the 12 months through February, the biggest advance since June 2014.

The kiwi dollar fell.
Gross domestic product gained 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, when it also rose 0.6 percent, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. Economists expected 0.8 percent growth, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 2.9 percent, less than the 3.1 percent forecast.
While the economy has been expanding at a healthy clip, inflation has remained subdued and the central bank has cut interest rates to a record low. A slump in business confidence after the September election may have curbed investment and damped growth early in 2018. The Reserve Bank signaled in February it would keep the official cash rate at 1.75 percent until mid-2019, and traders see just a 40 percent chance of a hike before the end of this year.
“We expect a temporary slowdown in growth over the first half of 2018 due to initial uncertainty following the recent change in government,” said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank in Auckland. “But the details in fourth-quarter GDP are encouraging and lift our confidence that economic growth will recover over the second half of this year.”
The New Zealand dollar fell a quarter of a U.S. cent on the report and bought 73.1 cents at 11:33 a.m. in Wellington. It’s climbed 7 percent against the greenback over the past three months, helping to damp the inflation outlook by suppressing import costs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell for a third straight month in February as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, prompting analysts to downgrade their first-quarter economic growth forecasts.
Despite signs of cooling in consumer spending, inflation pressures are steadily building, which should allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week. Other data on Wednesday showed underlying producer prices rose solidly in February, driven by strong gains in the cost of services such as hotel accommodation, airline fares and hospital inpatient care.
The sustained decline in retail sales is surprising as consumer confidence is at a more than 17-year high in the wake of a $15 trillion income tax cut package and a labor market that continues to churn out jobs. Economists said consumers boosted spending in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the lower taxes.
""Looking at consumer fundamentals there appears to be nothing sinister going on among America's households,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""We posit that the anticipation of the widely publicized tax cuts pulled forward spending into the fourth quarter of 2017.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month. January data was revised to show sales dipping 0.1 percent instead of falling 0.3 percent as previously reported. It was the first time since April 2012 that retail sales have declined for three straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.3 percent in February. Retail sales in February increased 4.0 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
As a result of the weak core retail sales at the start of the year, economists lowered their first-quarter GDP growth estimates. The Atlanta Fed slashed its forecast to a 1.9 percent annualized rate from a 2.5 percent pace. 
Data forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers cut its estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.7 percent rate, also taking into account revisions to January retail inventory data. 
The economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter, the government reported last month. But revisions to December data on construction spending, factory orders and inventories have suggested the fourth-quarter growth estimate could be raised to a 3.1 percent pace. The government will publish its third estimate for fourth-quarter GDP growth later this month.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said a key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.4 percent last month, matching January's gain. 
That boosted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PPI to 2.7 percent, the biggest gain since August 2014, from 2.5 percent in January. The increase in underlying wholesale prices supports views that consumer inflation will pick up this year.
STRONG INFLATION HYPOTHESIS
""We firmly believe that core consumer price inflation is rising and the March CPI report will be the acid test of that hypothesis,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
U.S. financial markets largely shrugged off the weak retail sales report and investors focused instead on the wholesale inflation data. The dollar initially firmed against a basket of currencies before giving up gains to trade little changed.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) shedding more than 250 points as domestic manufacturers continued to suffer from worries over the impact on trade from tariffs announced last week.
The Fed has forecast three interest rate increases this year. Many economists expect the U.S. central bank will raise its projection to four rate increases because of a robust labor market and firming inflation.
Economists believe that a tightening labor market, weak dollar and fiscal stimulus in the form of the tax cuts and increased government spending will lift inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target this year. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, has undershot its target since May 2012.
The massive tax cut package is part of a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which came into effect in January. Fed officials view the labor market as being near or a little beyond full employment. 
The economy added 313,000 jobs in February, giving analysts confidence that retail sales could rebound as soon as April. 
""Also keep in mind that most folks' tax withholding schedules were probably not reduced lower to reflect the TCJA rates until later in February, so that support to consumption may not be apparent until the springtime,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Auto sales fell 0.9 percent in February after a similar drop in January. There were also declines in sales at gasoline stations, furniture, health and personal care and electronics and appliance stores. 

But there were some pockets of strength. Sales at building material stores surged 1.9 percent last month. Receipts at clothing stores gained 0.4 percent and sales at online retailers jumped 1.0 percent. Consumers also spent more at restaurants and bars and splurged on sporting goods and hobbies.

The Fed has forecast three interest rate increases this year, with the first hike expected at the March 20-21 meeting. Some economists expect that it will raise its projection to four rate increases this year.
Last month, the price of services increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in January. Services were boosted by a rise in the cost of hotel accommodation, hospital inpatient care, airline fares and bundled wired telecommunications services. 
Prices for goods slipped 0.1 percent, the first drop since May 2017, after rising 0.7 percent in January. Wholesale food prices fell for a third straight month. Gasoline prices dropped 1.6 percent after surging 7.1 percent in January.

Economists and analysts have previously expected the momentum to slow down this year, but the data seemed to suggest that China’s economic growth remained robust.
Industrial output rose 7.2% y/y in the first months of the year, beating the general consensus of 6.2%. Fixed asset investment also came in higher than expected, jumping 7.9% y/y versus the estimate of 7.0%.
“Strong industrial output and investment reflect a more powerful economy than expected, backed up by credit growth in January and robust demand,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.
However, the data should be treated with caution, as they may be subject to distortions caused by the timing of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which started in late January in 2017 but in mid-February this year.

That’s down from a 21 percent pace in December. The January and February data was combined to smooth the effects of the Lunar New Year holiday.
The slower growth comes as authorities sent a stronger signal at the National People’s Congress on efforts to curb property speculation and tame runaway prices. Last week, an NPC spokesman said a property tax bill is being drafted, and the head of the nation’s banking regulator again called for steps to reduce household debt.
In other signs of a slowdown, developers bought less land than a year ago, the first decline in eight months. New starts, a leading indicator of real estate investment, rose at the slowest pace in three months, gaining 2.9 percent, the data showed.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>","Japan core machinery orders rebound, easing capex concerns","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rebounded in January from a steep decline the previous month, handily beating expectations in a sign that capital spending will continue contributing to economic growth.
The 8.2 percent rise in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in six to nine months, was more than the 5.6 percent increase expected by economists.
In December core orders tumbled a revised 9.3 percent, the fastest fall in more than three years. The Cabinet Office said in a statement on Wednesday that core machinery orders were ""recovering"".
Japan's economy expanded more than initially estimated in the last quarter of 2017, thanks to an upward revision of capital expenditure and inventory data, confirming the longest run of growth in 28 years.
Rising machinery orders suggest that Japan's recent growth spurt is likely to continue, but uncertainty surrounds the policy outlook because revelations of a cover-up of suspected cronyism is eroding confidence in the prime minister.
""I expect capital expenditure to continue to rise gradually, driven by strength in overseas economies,"" said Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The government's problems introduce some uncertainty, but at this stage companies are likely to look beyond the government's problems and focus on growth in overseas markets.""
Orders from manufacturers rose 9.9 percent in January, rebounding from an 8.5 percent decline in the previous month.
Non-manufacturers' orders rose 4.4 percent in January, also recovering from a 5.3 percent decline in the previous month.
From a year ago, core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, rose 2.9 percent, more than the median estimate for a 0.6 percent annual increase.
Some opposition lawmakers are calling on Finance Minister Taro Aso and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to resign after Aso admitted that finance ministry employees altered documents related to the sale of government land.
Critics say a person with ties to the prime minister's wife used this relationship to buy the land on the cheap. Abe has repeatedly denied that he or his wife were involved.
Another risk to the outlook is the chance of a trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Japan has requested an exemption, but it is unclear whether the U.S. government will grant one.
Despite these risks, economists said the capacity constraints in Japan's economy mean companies will inevitably increase investment.

""The bigger picture is that firms are facing the most severe capacity and staff shortages since the early 1990s which suggests that capital spending will continue to expand at a solid pace this year,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

Industrial output was 0.9 percent higher when measured on a year-over-year basis. 
Among the various components, manufacturing fell 0.5 percent from December while construction climbed 0.5 percent, utilities rose 2 percent and mining gained 1.6 percent. On a year-over-year basis, mining was down 5 percent, construction was up 4 percent and utilities rose 1.6 percent.
Mexico's industrial output is tightly linked to the U.S. economy, which receives about 80 percent of its exports. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to leave the North American Free Trade Agreement have triggered uncertainty in Mexico, which sends mostly factory-made goods like televisions and cars to its northern neighbor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer price growth slowed in February amid a decline in gasoline prices and a moderation in the cost of rental accommodation, the latest indication that an anticipated pickup in inflation probably will be only gradual.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month after jumping 0.5 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 2.2 percent, up from 2.1 percent in January as the weak reading from last year dropped from the calculation. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.2 percent after accelerating 0.3 percent in January. The year-on-year increase in the so-called core CPI was unchanged at 1.8 percent in February.
""While there is evidence of building inflationary pressures in certain components, the annual growth rates, especially for the core CPI, do not suggest a breakout in inflation yet,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide, in Columbus, Ohio. 
Last month's increase in consumer prices was in line with economists' expectations. The Federal Reserve tracks a different index, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which has consistently undershot the central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
The CPI report came on the heels of data last Friday showing a deceleration in wage growth in February as well as a downward revision to January's increase in average hourly earnings. Average hourly earnings rose 2.6 percent on an annual basis in February, stepping down from January's 2.8 percent increase.
The dollar pared gains versus the yen and extended losses against the euro. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading higher. U.S. stock index futures rose.
Against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and strong economy, the Fed is widely expected to increase interest rates at its March 20-21 meeting. But steady inflation gains suggest the U.S. central bank will probably not change its interest rate forecast at next week's policy meeting.
FULL EMPLOYMENT
The Fed has forecast three rate hikes this year. Many economists expect that at some point it will upgrade its projection to four rate increases in 2018 amid optimism that the robust labor market will start boosting wage growth at least by the second half of this year. Policymakers consider the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment. 
The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and economists expect it to drop to 3.5 percent by year-end. A weakening dollar and fiscal stimulus in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending are also seen spurring inflation.
In February, gasoline prices fell 0.9 percent after rebounding 5.7 percent in January. Food prices were unchanged, with the cost of food consumed at home dropping 0.2 percent. Food prices rose 0.2 percent in January.
The core CPI was restrained by a moderation in rents. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.3 percent in January.
Healthcare costs slipped 0.1 percent in February, with prices for hospital care falling 0.5 percent and the cost of prescription medication declining 0.4 percent. The cost of doctor visits, however, rose 0.2 percent. 
Apparel prices continued to march higher, rising 1.5 percent in February after surging 1.7 percent in January. The cost of motor vehicle insurance rose by a record 1.7 percent last month.
Prices of new motor vehicles fell 0.5 percent, the biggest drop since August 2009, after slipping 0.1 percent in January.

Used car and trucks prices dropped after four straight monthly increases and the cost of airline fares rebounded after falling in February.

Core CPI is a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs.

457,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 01:01AM ET</span>",Easing India Inflation Reprieve for Asia's Worst Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s inflation rate dropped below 5 percent for the first time in three months, giving the central bank room to keep interest rates on hold for longer while providing relief to battered bond investors.
Government data on Monday showed inflation at 4.44 percent in February, lower than the 5.07 percent pace in January and below the 4.7 percent estimate of economists polled by Bloomberg News. The easing for the second straight month offers bond investors in India -- the worst performing market among major Asian economies -- something of a temporary cheer. The benchmark 10-year bond yield fell three basis points to 7.60 percent.
“The sharp dip in retail inflation has reinforced our expectation that the MPC would keep the repo rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review in April, which may prompt a further easing of bond yields in the immediate term,” Aditi Nayar, economist at ICRA Ltd. said referring to the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee that’s scheduled to meet April 4-5.
Most analysts and the Reserve Bank of India itself expect inflationary pressures to gather steam in coming months. The central bank expects inflation to reach 5.1-5.6 percent in the first half of the financial year starting April 1, before easing in the second half. The RBI targets inflation over the medium term at 4 percent with an upper limit of 6 percent and a lower threshold of 2 percent.
Last month, one member of the six-member monetary policy committee voted for a rate hike, another gave up his call for rate cuts while Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy, Viral Acharya, also veered more toward the hawkish camp. The rest, for now, appeared neutral. Still, the MPC voted to keep rates unchanged at its last meeting and flagged the government’s decision to widen budget deficit targets as something that will have an inflationary impact.
""The RBI will have room to push back a rate hike, but not for too long as input price pressures have been on the rise over the past one year, and price pass-through to consumers is now taking place,"" said Teresa John, economist at Nirmal Bang Pvt. Equities Ltd.
Analysts expect food inflation to rise because of the seasonal upturn in vegetable prices in the summer, an increase in minimum support price of summer crops that will reflect with a lag, and an upswing in global wheat prices. Moreover, core inflation is sticky at around 5 percent, while an imposition of more tariffs on some imports like mobile phones is likely to boost price pressures, and may prompt RBI to wait and watch.
Uptick
Separate data showed industrial production rose 7.5 percent in January, handily beating estimates of a 6.4 percent rise and a growth of 7.1 percent in December. Also, private sector data showed local passenger vehicle sales grew 7.8 percent in February from a year ago, highlighting steady demand in the economy.
Nevertheless, the recovery from the cash ban and the chaotic introduction of the consumption tax last year has been uneven. India’s dominant services sector contracted in February, with scandals hitting the corporate and banking sectors and weighing on business sentiment.
The RBI expects growth to pick up in the next financial year. It sees gross value added -- a key measure of growth -- increasing 7.2 percent next fiscal year from 6.6 percent this year.

(Reuters) - At a time when volatility in financial markets is creeping up on rising bond yields and fears of U.S trade protectionism, one modern leading indicator of trouble ahead suggests stock market losses could intensify going forward.
Cross asset correlations - the degree to which the price of a financial instrument is affected by a change in the price of another asset class - last week hit a near two-year peak, according to a Reuters analysis of weekly price returns on eight major instruments.
That still leaves the measure short of highs seen around a handful of major market collapses in the past decade: the initial peak of the Eurozone debt crisis in 2011, 2013's Federal Reserve driven ""taper-tantrum"" and the 2008 crash.
But since a record Feb 6. fall in the Dow Jones Industrials Index (DJI), it is heading for a 2015 peak which coincided with another slide - China's stock market crash and devaluation of the yuan, and the resulting brief selloff in stocks and emerging market assets.
(GRAPHIC: Cross-asset correlations - http://reut.rs/2FnbGGK) 
""During the times of stress when assets are sold off, they are sold off together, partly owing to the fact that previously all the markets were rising together,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank inSingapore.
""High cross-asset correlations validate the start of a sell-off and get accentuated during the sell-off.""
The era of globalisation of financial markets and investment has seen cross-asset correlations in general trend higher.
In the past decade, when banks and investors were searching for places to lodge the floods of central bank money pumped into the global economy, that meant a crowding out that prompted analysts to warn of market bubbles.
If markets also trend down together, however, it means the big blue-chip investors who have piled money into these markets will need to find places to hide as asset values fall.

""If there are no gradual corrections coming, and we do see a lot of highly correlated asset market moves, then the correction phase would also be little bit more brutal,"" said Mizuho's Varathan.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian retail inflation likely eased to a four-month low in February on softening prices for vegetable and other perishable foods, but probably stayed above the Reserve Bank of India's target, a Reuters poll showed.
Along with recent news that India in late 2017 was the world's fastest-growing major economy, this may bring some comfort to policymakers in a delicate balancing act between rising price pressure and letting economic activity rip.
The annual increase in the consumer price index , the main measure of inflation in India, likely slipped to 4.80 percent in February from 5.07 percent the previous month, according to the poll of 30 economists. The forecast range was 4.36-5.60 percent.
The February inflation data is due at 1200 GMT on Monday, March 12.
If the data matches the consensus, February's pace will be the lowest since October, and down from a 17-month high in December, but still above the RBI's 4 percent medium-term target for a fourth month. 
And the small reprieve, if it comes, won't likely last long. The central bank expects inflation to pick up to 5.1-5.6 percent in April-September and then ease later on anticipation of for normal rainfall.
The main concern among economists is the government's expansionary budget.
From April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration plans to step up spending on welfare, particularly in rural areas, and increase the guaranteed price for agricultural produce - called the minimum support price (MSP) - ahead of national elections next year.
""We expect a sharp retreat in inflation in February led by a fall in perishable food prices that earlier forced the inflation upsurge from lows in June 2017,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
""But the big picture is the prospective MSP hikes, which continue to be the elephant in the room as far as the inflation outlook is concerned.""
Annual wholesale price inflation  also likely eased to 2.50 percent in February from 2.84 percent in January, the poll showed.
Separately, the poll showed industrial production  likely rose 6.7 percent in January from a year earlier, less than December's 7.1 percent growth.
Output in eight core infrastructure industries, which account for about 40 percent of overall industrial production, rose 6.7 percent in January from a year ago.

Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Finance Holding, said that putting aside a few sectors that maintained good growth tracks in January - like cement, refinery products and power generation - ""overall growth moment remained flattish"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in February, recording its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years, but a slowdown in wage gains pointed to only a gradual increase in inflation this year.
Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, boosted by the largest rise in construction jobs since 2007, the Labor Department said on Friday. The payrolls gain was the biggest since July 2016 and triple the roughly 100,000 jobs the economy needs to create each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The labor market is benefiting from strong domestic demand, an improvement in global growth as well as robust U.S. business sentiment following the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package that come into effect in January.
Average hourly earnings edged up four cents, or 0.1 percent, to $26.75 in February, a slowdown from the 0.3 percent rise in January. That lowered the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in January.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in February for a fifth straight month as 806,000 people entered the labor force in a sign of confidence in the job market. The average workweek rebounded to 34.5 hours after falling to 34.4 hours in January.
With Federal Reserve officials considering the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment, the moderation in wage growth last month did little to change the view that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates at its March 20-21 policy meeting.
Slow wage growth, however, could temper expectations the Fed will raise its rate forecast to four hikes this year from three. There is optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth this year and pull inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
""While the employment gains unequivocally suggest underlying strength in the economy, wage gains remain muted enough for the Fed to continue with an only gradual normalization of the policy stance. Stock markets are reacting accordingly,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank in New York.
Speculation that the central bank would upgrade its rate projections was stoked by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he told lawmakers last week that ""my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December."" 
While Powell said there was no evidence of the economy overheating, he added ""the thing we don't want to have happen is to get behind the curve.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 200,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 4.0 percent. Average hourly earnings had been expected to increase 0.2 percent in February.
Data for December and January was revised to show the economy adding 54,000 more jobs than previously reported.
U.S. stock indexes opened higher after the data while prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower. The dollar (DXY) was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies.
CONSTRUCTION SHINES
Some companies like  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and FedEx Corp (N:FDX) have said they would use some of their windfall from a tax cut package to boost workers' salaries. Walmart (N:WMT) announced an increase in entry-level wages for hourly employees at its U.S. stores effective in February.
The employment report suggested the economy remained strong despite weak consumer spending, home sales, industrial production and a wider trade deficit in January that prompted economists to lower their first-quarter growth estimates. Gross domestic product estimates for the January-March quarter are around a 2 percent annualized growth rate. The economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The full impact of the tax cuts and a planned increase in government spending has yet to be felt, and a robust job market could heighten fears of the economy overheating. 
""The economy is simply too strong,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There's no reason whatsoever for the Federal Reserve to have a stimulative monetary policy at this stage of the business cycle."" 
Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.5 percent this year. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 8.2 percent last month. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose three-tenths of a percentage point to a five-month high of 63.0 percent in February. 
An even broader gauge of labor market health, the percentage of working-age Americans with a job, increased to 60.4 percent last month from 60.1 percent in January.
Employment gains were led by the construction sector, which added 61,000 jobs, the most since March 2007. Hiring at construction sites was likely boosted by unseasonably mild temperatures in February. 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 31,000 jobs, rising for a seventh straight month. The sector is being supported by strong domestic and international demand as well as a weaker dollar. Retail payrolls jumped by 50,300, the largest increase since February 2016. 
The Labor Department said that was because on an unadjusted basis the sector hired fewer workers than usual for the holiday season and did not shed many jobs after the holidays. As a result, retail employment rose after the seasonal adjustment, the department said. 
Government employment increased by 26,000 jobs last month, with hiring of teachers by local governments accounting for the bulk of the rise. There were also increases in payrolls for professional and business services, leisure and hospitality as well as healthcare and social assistance. 

Financial sector payrolls increased by 28,000 last month, the most since October 2005.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:50PM ET</span>","Japan real wages slump, overshadow rebound in household spending","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rebounded in January but workers' wages fell at the fastest pace in six months, in a worrying sign that consumption will lose momentum this year and weigh on an economy now enjoying its longest run of growth in 28 years.
A spate of data issued on Friday cast doubt on the Bank of Japan's optimistic projection that a strengthening recovery will prompt firms to hike wages and boost consumption, helping accelerate inflation to its elusive 2 percent target.
The weakness in wage growth could also reinforce market expectations the BOJ will lag far behind major peers in dialing back its massive stimulus program, analysts say.
""The slowdown in base pay in January suggests that the Bank of Japan won't be able to tighten monetary policy anytime soon,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Wages would have to rise at a much faster pace to create major cost pressures for firms.""
Household spending rose 1.9 percent in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, rebounding from a 0.1 percent drop in December.
But the gain was driven mostly by higher costs for necessities, as unusually cold weather forced households to spend more on fuel and medical treatment, the data showed.
Separate data showed workers' wages after adjustments for inflation fell 0.9 percent in January from a year ago, marking the biggest decline since a 1.1 percent drop in July 2017.
The decline suggests the government will struggle to convince large companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more this year at annual negotiations with labor unions, which are expected to conclude next week. 
Consumption has been a soft spot in an otherwise robust recovery, hampering the BOJ's efforts to achieve its inflation target as firms remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households.
Service-sector confidence worsened in February for a third straight month to a 10-month low, data showed on Thursday, underscoring the fragility of consumer spending.
The government simplified the survey it asks households to complete for the household spending data, which affected some of January's results.

Some analysts say household spending data tends to be more volatile and shows a weaker picture of consumption than retail sales figures, because it is compiled from a limited sample of households and is skewed towards an older generation who do not spend much.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>","China's February factory inflation slows, consumer price growth hits more than four-year high","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation eased to the slowest pace in 15 months in February, as the cost of raw materials and other inputs rose at a milder pace, pointing to a potential softening in industrial sector profits.
Consumer inflation picked up to highest since November 2013, however, largely due to higher food prices as China celebrated the long Lunar New Year holidays, official data showed on Friday.
Data from China early in the year is typically treated with caution by economists due to business and price distortions caused by the timing of the week-long Lunar New Year celebrations, which fell in late January 2017 but started in mid-February this year.
Analysts expect investors may not get a clearer picture of China's economic health until first-quarter data is released in April.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 3.7 percent in February from a year earlier, compared with 4.3 percent in January, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday.
China's factory-gate inflation has now softened for 4 months in a row, suggesting that profits for miners, steel makes and manufacturers will start to moderate after surging to their strongest levels in years in 2017.
That would give the country's ""smokestack"" industries, which are dominated by state-owned giants, less cash flow to service and pay down their debts, a key policy goal for Beijing.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected February producer inflation would cool to 3.8 percent from January's 4.3 percent.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI fell 0.1 percent.
For the combined period of January and February, PPI rose 4.0 percent from a year ago.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, more than expectations and quickening from January's gain of 1.5 percent. Analysts had expected a pick-up to 2.5 percent.
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose 1.2 percent.
CPI rose 2.2 percent for January-February period.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.5 percent in February, faster than 1.9 percent in January.
""The year-on-year increase in CPI is expected to ease in March as holiday effects recede,"" Sheng Guoqing, a statistics bureau official said in a commentary accompanying the data release. 
The food price index rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier due to a low base last year, after falling 0.5 percent in January. Non-food prices rose 2.5 percent, compared with 2.0 percent in the previous month.
Much of the pick up in consumer prices was likely due to higher food and travel costs during the long holiday.
As widely expected, China announced a 2018 consumer inflation target of ""around 3 percent"", in line with last year, at its annual parliament meeting that started this week.
But most analysts do not expect retail inflation to reach that level, even though higher producer prices over the last year are slowly percolating through to consumers. Consumer inflation last year softened to 1.6 percent despite forecast-beating economic growth.

Producer inflation is expected to continue to moderate in coming months as property investment cools, reducing demand for products from steel and cement to appliances and furniture.

470,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",China Factory Inflation Eases as Consumer Prices Jump on Holiday,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation slowed for a fourth month while consumer prices jumped as millions traveled home to feast with family and friends for the Chinese New Year holiday.
Key Points
Big Picture
Continued moderation in factory inflation from the world’s largest exporter may signal the waning of a global reflation trend at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is proceeding with monetary policy normalization. At the same time, domestic consumer prices are forecast to rise this year on resilient demand and recovering food prices, while remaining within the government’s 3 percent ceiling.
Economist Takeaways
“There’s a lot of inflation pressure coming through” for consumers, Helen Qiao, chief Greater China economist at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It’s getting closer to 3 percent, which is their comfort level, so I’d say in particular they’d watch out for inflation pressure in food prices.”
“We can’t ignore the much higher consumer inflation pressure this year, and that’s what the central bank is looking at,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd in Hong Kong. “Monetary policy is already tightening.”
“When we look at the underlying data, the jump in CPI seems more driven by seasonal fluctuations,” said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen. “PPI is continuing its steady decline and is expected to continue lower in the months ahead due to declining commodity input prices and the base effect.”
“Strong demand during Chinese New Year and also the extreme low base last year are the two biggest factors that pushed up the CPI,” said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst at Bank of Communications Co. in Shanghai. “As those two factors are temporary, the CPI may head down in coming months, and the overall inflation pressure is still acceptable. PPI will likely see moderate growth, but is unlikely to fall into negative territory.”

The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, added to December data on construction spending and manufacturers inventories in suggesting that gross domestic product grew much faster than the 2.5 percent annualized rate reported by the government in its second estimate last month.
Before the QSS data, economists had expected that GDP growth for the October-December quarter would be raised to about a 2.6 percent rate. Some now expect fourth-quarter GDP growth would be revised up to a 2.9 percent rate when the Commerce Department's statistics agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, incorporates the data into its third estimate to be published later this month.
""The QSS points to stronger services spending in the fourth quarter than the BEA had previously estimated,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""And while the QSS often impacts health care categories within the spending data, we think that much of the expected fourth-quarter upward revision will be related to spending on motor vehicle maintenance and repair.""
Silver also said the QSS data pointed to a modest downward revision to investment in intellectual property products. 

Spending on intellectual property products was previously reported to have increased at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rebounded last week from a more than 48-year low, but the trend continued to point to robust labor market conditions.
That was underscored by other data on Thursday showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 20 percent in February. Federal Reserve officials consider the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment. The tight jobs market is seen boosting wage growth and spurring inflation.
""The well looks increasingly dry to many companies seeking skilled workers, and time will tell whether the lack of labor will slow the overall economy in future months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended March 3, the Labor Department said. Claims dropped to 210,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since December 1969. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. It was the 157th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The claims data has no impact on February's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. Claims mostly declined in February, leading economists to expect another month of strong job growth. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the Labor Department's closely followed employment report will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month, matching January's gains. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent, which would be the lowest level since December 2000.
In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced 35,369 job cuts in February, down 20 percent from January.
LOW LAYOFFS
So far this year, employers have announced 80,022 layoffs, the lowest number of planned job cuts between January and February since 1995. Planned layoffs have been below 50,000 a month for the last 22 months, the longest streak since the company started tracking the series.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said monetary policy would remain ""reactive"" and that measures of underlying inflation were still subdued. 
Prices for U.S. government bonds rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after President Donald Trump promised great flexibility toward the United States' ""real friends"" as he prepared to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Trump's plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum to protect domestic producers against competition has sparked wide condemnation and stoked fears of a trade war.
""President Trump's proposed new tariffs on steel and aluminum may spell more jobs in those industries in the short term,"" said John Challenger, Chief Executive Officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. 
""However, with automation dominating those industries, the tariffs will more likely cause companies that manufacture using those products, such as automotive and aerospace, to cut jobs.""
The Labor Department report showed the four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,000 to 222,500 last week.

It also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 64,000 to 1.87 million in the week ended Feb. 24. The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims fell 14,250 to 1.91 million.

Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 10,000 to 220,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 222,500, up 2,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Weaker foreign demand drove a bigger than expected drop in German industrial orders in January, data showed on Thursday, suggesting that busy factories in Europe's largest economy could shift into a lower gear in the coming months.
Extended factory closures after Christmas and New Year holidays also played a part, with commentators cautioning against reading too much into one month's data.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods fell by 3.9 percent on the month in January after surging by a downwardly revised 3.0 percent in the previous month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
The reading was the weakest since January 2017 and undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a 1.6 percent drop.
""German new orders had a horrible start to the new year,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding that the drop did not come as a surprise since most German factories were closed the entire first week of January because of extended holidays.
Brzeski said the economic fundamentals remained good and order books were still filled. ""German industry does not look at risk of faltering any time soon,"" he added.
The economy ministry said the overall trend in industrial orders was still pointing upwards despite the drop in January, adding that bookings were up 0.9 percent in December and January compared to the previous two months.
Industrial orders rose 8.2 percent on the year in January, the ministry said, adding that sentiment surveys are suggesting the global recovery will continue. ""So German industry is likely to continue its positive development,"" it said.
Foreign demand fell by 4.6 percent on the month in January, driven by a decline in orders of nearly 6 percent from other euro zone countries, a breakdown of the data showed.

Orders for capital goods dropped 5 percent, demand for intermediate goods fell 3.3 percent while manufacturers of consumer goods registered a rise in orders of 2.4 percent.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 12:54AM ET</span>","Japan fourth-quarter GDP growth revised up, BOJ seen in no rush to exit easy policy","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded more than initially estimated in the last quarter of 2017, thanks to an upward revision of capital expenditure and inventory data, confirming the longest run of growth in 28 years.
Global demand for technological products has driven an investment boom in many of the country's high-end sectors, such as autos, semiconductors and precision machinery, mirroring trends seen in other major Asian exporting nations.
However, despite the solid growth -- the eighth consecutive quarter of expansion -- analysts say the Bank of Japan is unlikely to bring forward a debate on exit from monetary stimulus given the sluggish wages that have prevented consumer spending and inflation from accelerating.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who is set to serve another term, rattled markets last Friday by flagging for the first time the prospect of an exit from monetary stimulus if 2 percent inflation were met in fiscal 2019 - a remark he later tempered.
""It will take longer to achieve the 2 percent target. There's no change to this perception after the GDP data that merely confirmed Japan remains on track for stable growth led by global economy's expansion,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Inflation holds the key to a debate on exit, but it won't accelerate as long as wages and private consumption lack momentum even as capital spending rises. In that sense, the focus will be the upcoming annual wage talks, rather than data.""
The economy grew an annualized 1.6 percent in October-December, versus economists' median estimate for 0.9 percent annualized growth and the preliminary reading of a 0.5 percent expansion, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
The annualized growth rate translates into quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.4 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, against an initial reading of a 0.1 percent growth and the median estimate for 0.2 percent growth.
There was no significant market reaction during Asian trade to the stronger-than-expected data.
The upward revision was due to faster-than-expected gains in capital expenditure, thanks to investment in information and communications such as smartphone and production machinery including robots and labor-saving technology.
Private inventory was the biggest contributor to the upward GDP revision due to rising stock of crude oil and natural gas, steel products, electronics parts and devices, a Cabinet Office official said.
DEFLATIONARY MINDSET
Policymakers are keen to stoke a virtuous growth cycle in which higher wages stimulate consumer spending, in turn boosting business investment and accelerating inflation.
However, the central bank also admits that it is difficult to shake the deflationary mindset that has been entrenched in consumers and companies during 15 years of falling prices.
Sales fell a second straight month in February at  Torikizoku Co Ltd  (T:3193) after it raised prices of its grilled chicken skewers for the first time in almost 30 years last October - a move that alienated customers and hurt its stock price.
Fast food operator  Yoshinoya Holdings  Co (T:9861) had a rush of customers nationwide last month when it offered free vouchers for its signature beef bowl dish priced at 380 yen ($3.58) - long a symbol of the deflationary economy - causing traffic jams surrounding its restaurants.
Underscoring fragile consumer spending, service-sector confidence worsened in February for a third straight month to a 10-month low, according to government survey dubbed ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.
With inflation remaining distant from the 2 percent target, the central bank is widely expected to keep its massive monetary easing intact at its policy-setting meeting that ends on Friday.
Thursday's data showed the capital expenditure component of GDP grew 1.0 percent from the previous quarter, versus the median forecast for 1.2 percent growth, and the preliminary 0.7 percent gain.
Private inventories contributed 0.1 percentage point to the overall GDP growth, versus the preliminary estimate of minus 0.1 percentage point.
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.5 percent in October-December from the previous three months, unchanged from the preliminary reading.
Domestic demand contributed 0.4 percentage points to revised GDP, while net exports - or exports minus imports - were balanced, making no contribution, the data showed.
""Recent weak data such as industrial output and retail sales for January suggest GDP growth may slow in the first quarter,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.

Japan’s economy grew a better than expected 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, but is now likely entering a soft patch, economists say, with a chance that the longest run of expansion in nearly three decades could end in the first quarter. This would hurt the Bank of Japan, which has been making some progress toward 2 percent inflation.
""I think it’s likely we are going to see some deceleration in the pace of economic expansion,"" said Takashi Shiono, an economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group. ""Wages aren’t rising much and that makes it unlikely households will step up spending. A strong yen is posing risks for corporate profits and could cool sentiment among companies and consumers.""
The Japanese economy has grown for eight straight quarters as global demand for exports fueled record corporate profits and rising business investment.
One red flag in recent data: Industrial production contracted 6.6 percent in January from a month earlier. That was the biggest drop since March 2011, when the nation was hit by an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. Production is forecast to have rebounded sharply in February before falling again in March.
Retail sales also fell 1.8 percent in January from a month earlier, as Japan suffered through a particularly cold start to the year. In addition, a build-up in inventories during the fourth quarter, one reason for a bigger-than-expected revision to growth, could reverse to weigh on first-quarter results.
""Electronic parts inventories are building up, and if you consider an upward revision of inventories from a macroeconomic perspective, it’s not a great move,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. ""So I don’t think we can be too happy.""

To be sure, economists remain positive about the longer-term outlook.
""There’s no change to the fact that we’re seeing fairly stable growth,"" Atsushi Takeda, an economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. ""In the long term the fundamentals are still firm.""
More than a slowdown in trade, an appreciation of the yen is the ""real risk"" to economic growth that would weigh on corporate profits and wages, Muto said.
The yen has strengthened more than 6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. Corporate profit growth had already been slowing, rising only 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2016.
“Considering the first quarter this year, given how the yen is strengthening, it’s hard to see a continuation of the picture of manufacturers leading record profits, and we’re already seeing the beginning of a stumble in the fourth-quarter data,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.

Exports rose 44.5 percent in February in dollar terms after rising 11.1 percent the previous month, the customs administration said Thursday. Import growth slowed to 6.3 percent from a revised 36.8 percent in January, to leave a trade surplus of $33.7 billion.
The latest readings come as the annual legislative congress is convening to chart policy for the coming year amid rising trade threats from the Trump administration, with the U.S. president planning to sign orders for new steel and aluminum tariffs Thursday. Premier Li Keqiang on Monday announced a 2018 growth goal of around 6.5 percent, omitting an aim for a faster pace, while pledging to open China’s market further and seek “more balanced development of trade.”
Underscoring the difficulty of reading China’s economic data early in the year, the official factory gauge fell to 50.3 in February for the biggest slump in five years, partly due to a week-long Chinese New Year holiday during which factories and offices closed.
China-U.S. trade tensions are one of the major concerns underpinning more cautious market sentiment, Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in a recent note. “The direct impact on China, of steel and aluminum tariffs, is negligible, but investors are concerned that it could be the beginning of a broad trade war.”

Imports grew 6.3 percent, the General Administration of Customs said, missing analysts' forecast for 9.7 percent growth, and down from a sharper-than-expected 36.9 percent jump in January.
Analysts caution Chinese data early in the year can be heavily distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year but in January in 2017.

But combined January-February trade data also showed a dramatic acceleration in export growth.
Exports rose 24.4 percent on-year in Jan-Feb, much better than 10.8 percent in December and 4 percent growth in Jan-Feb last year.
The government also releases combined data for the first two months in an attempt to smooth out seasonal distortions.
The deceleration in import growth for February may be payback for the previous month's unusual strength, rather than a sign there has been an abrupt weakening in demand. 
Robust import growth in January was mostly led by commodities as factories scrambled to restock inventories ahead of the long holiday.
Imports in the first two months of the year rose 21.7 percent, compared with 4.5 percent in December.
China's trade surplus widened to $33.74 billion for February, compared with forecasts for $0.6 billion and January's $20.35 billion.
For Jan-Feb combined, the surplus rose 43.6 percent from the year earlier period to $54.32 billion.
Boosted by a global trade boom in 2017, China's exports grew at the fastest pace since 2013 and served as one of the key drivers behind the economy's forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion last year.
But tough U.S. trade talk last year is now turning into action.
President Donald Trump is expected to sign a proclamation on Thursday or Friday to establish the steel and aluminum tariffs, to counter cheap imports, especially from China, though close U.S. allies may get exemptions.
The measures are expected to go into effect in two months, but economists see little immediate impact on China.
It has already reduced steel exports to the U.S. to a trickle, and while aluminum shipments account for around 10 percent of its total global exports of the metal, the number is still small compared with China's total exports, according to ING economist Iris Pang.
""All in all, the direct impact on China is minimal,"" Pang said in a note published on Thursday.
Over time, however, any additional punitive U.S. measures and retaliations by China or its other major trading partners would reduce global trade flows, disrupt international supply chains and drag on global growth.
U.S. plans to combat intellectual property theft, which are believed to be moving quickly through the pipeline, could also have a more significant impact on China's exporters, particularly in hi-tech, high-value industries.
Net exports contributed 9.1 percent of China's GDP growth last year. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday that China would make a necessary response in the event of a trade war with the United States but said such a war would only harm all sides. 
Speaking on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China's parliament, Wang said China had no intention of displacing the United States and that the two countries did not have to be rivals but should strive to be partners.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through the end of the year, noted most districts reported “moderate inflation” amid ongoing labor market tightness and higher wages.
“In many Districts, wage growth picked up to a moderate pace, the beige book report noted. “Most Districts saw employers raise wages and expand benefit packages in response to tight labor market conditions.”
While economic activity expanded at “modest to moderate pace,” consumer spending was described as ""mixed,"" according to the report.
“Consumer spending was mixed, as non-auto retail sales increased in just over half of the Districts while auto sales declined or were flat in every District.”
The upbeat outlook on wage growth comes on the heels of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s testimony before the Senate last week, in which he said the central bank was cautious of falling behind the curve on inflation.
Core PCE, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, showed a reading of 1.5% For January, well below the Fed’s 2% target.
That said, however, market participants remained confident the Fed will hike rates at its March meeting."

483,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit races to more than nine-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased to a more than nine-year high in January, with the shortfall with China widening sharply, suggesting that President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policies aimed at eradicating the deficit will likely fail.
The trade gap continues to widen a year into the Trump presidency. Trump, who claims that the United States is being taken advantage of by its trading partners, has imposed tariffs on imports of some goods and threatened punitive measures on others to shield domestic industries from competition. The protectionist measures have sparked fears of a trade war.
""Trump's economics team is trying to turn back the clock on trade, but we doubt they will succeed as they are interfering with the business decisions made by thousands of American companies over the years,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""This is a trade war with ourselves."" 
The United States has been running trade deficits for decades, with the trend worsening over the last 30 years as companies shifted manufacturing to countries like China.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade deficit jumped 5.0 percent to $56.6 billion. That was the highest level since October 2008 and exceeded economists' expectations of an increase to $55.1 billion. Part of the rise in the trade gap in January reflected higher commodity prices.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 16.7 percent to $36.0 billion, the highest since September 2015. The deficit with Canada soared 65 percent to a three-year high of $3.6 billion. China and Canada are the United States' top trading partners.
Trump in late January imposed broad tariffs on imported solar panels and large washing machines. Last week, Trump announced he would slap import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect domestic producers. 
While these actions may prove politically popular with Trump's working class political base, especially in states hard-hit by factory closures and import competition, analysts warn they could undercut economic growth.
There are fears that the tariffs could jeopardize talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) linking Canada, Mexico and the United States. Trump ordered a renegotiation of the trade pact to offer terms more favorable to Washington. 
Worries of a trade war were heightened on Tuesday by the resignation of Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic advisor, spooking financial markets. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower while prices for U.S. government bonds rose, attracting safe-haven bids. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies.
FULL EMPLOYMENT
Trump's ""America First"" trade policies are part of an attempt to boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis. The government in January slashed corporate and individual income taxes. 
But with the economy almost at full employment, the increase in demand spurred by the $1.5 trillion tax package will probably be satisfied with imports, further worsening the trade deficit.
The economy's strong fundamentals were underscored by a separate report on Wednesday from ADP Research Institute showing private employers added 235,000 jobs in February. 
The report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment data on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs last month, matching January's gains. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent, which would be the lowest level since December 2000.
The surge in the January trade deficit was flagged by an advance goods trade deficit report last week. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit increased to $69.7 billion from $68.5 billion in December. 
The so-called real trade deficit is above the fourth-quarter average of $66.8 billion. This suggests trade would subtract from first-quarter gross domestic product unless the deficit shrinks in February and March. Trade sliced 1.13 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth.
""Strong growth in U.S. domestic demand should continue to pull in non-petroleum imports going forward,"" said Jay Bryson, global economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Net exports likely will exert another significant drag on overall GDP growth in the first quarter.""
The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.0 percent pace.
In January, exports fell 1.3 percent to $200.9 billion, weighed down by a $1.8 billion drop in civilian aircraft. Crude oil exports also declined. But exports of consumer goods rose to a record high and those of motor vehicles, parts and engines were the highest since July 2014.
Exports to China tumbled 28.1 percent. Imports were unchanged at $257.5 billion in January amid a $1.3 billion drop in cellphone imports as well as a $0.9 billion decrease in civilian aircraft. Crude oil imports increased by $2.2 billion, reflecting higher prices. Imports from China rose 2.9 percent.
A third report from the Labor Department showed worker productivity flat in the fourth quarter instead of declining at a 0.1 percent rate as reported last month. Sluggish productivity could make it difficult for the Trump administration to achieve its 3 percent growth target.

Annual economic growth has not surpassed 3 percent since 2005. Gross domestic product expanded 2.3 percent in 2017.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. fourth-quarter unit labor costs revised higher,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. unit labor costs increased faster than initially thought in the fourth quarter amid weak worker productivity, but the trend pointed to a gradual increase in inflation.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday that unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the last quarter instead of increasing at a 2.0 percent pace as reported last month.
Unit labor costs rose at a 1.0 percent rate in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, they increased at a 1.7 percent rate. Costs increased 0.4 percent in 2017, revised up from the previously reported 0.2 percent gain. 
Inflation is expected to accelerate this year, driven by rising commodity prices and tightening labor market conditions. The labor market is considered to be either near or a little beyond full employment. Inflation has consistently undershot the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
The increase in hourly compensation in the fourth quarter was revised up to a 2.4 percent rate from the previously reported 1.8 percent rate. 
Worker productivity was revised to show it unchanged instead of declining at a 0.1 percent rate as reported last month. Productivity grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the third quarter and increased at a 1.1 percent rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Worker productivity has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent from 2007 to 2017, below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2017. Sluggish productivity could make it difficult for the Trump administration to lift annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis.
Annual economic growth has not surpassed 3.0 percent since 2005. Gross domestic product expanded 2.3 percent in 2017.

The government slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent in January and there is cautious optimism that businesses will use some of the windfall from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package to buy machinery and other equipment to boost productivity.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>","Australian economy hit speed bump in fourth quarter, RBA still upbeat on future","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economic growth slowed last quarter as bad weather hit exports, though stronger-than-expected government spending and a revival in household consumption helped the country extend its 26-year run without recession.
Wednesday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.4 percent in the December quarter, from an upwardly revised 0.7 percent in the previous quarter. Analysts had looked for a rise of around 0.5 percent.
The annual pace slowed to 2.4 percent, from an upwardly revised 2.9 percent in the September quarter.
The result would be something of a disappointment for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which only kept interest rates steady at 1.50 percent on Tuesday in anticipation of faster growth and a gradual revival in inflation.
Yet, RBA Governor Philip Lowe foreshadowed earlier in the day that GDP growth might come in a little under 0.5 percent, and emphasized this would not shake his confidence in the broader outlook.
Investors expect policy will stay on hold for a long time to come and interbank futures <0#YIB:> are not fully priced for a hike in rates until early 2019.
Household consumption and government spending added to growth, while net exports as well as declining dwelling and resources investment were major drags.
The RBA expects the fall in exports to be temporary, although there continues to be uncertainty around the outlook for consumer spending as households are burdened under a mountain of debt.
Data out on Tuesday showed January retail sales rose a tepid 0.1 percent with falls in clothing, footwear and department stores.
Households did splash out more on tourism, transport, clothing, eating out and health in the December quarter, while cutting back on utilities and food.
Over the year to December, the value of goods and services produced amounted to A$1.8 trillion ($1.40 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$73,000 for each of Australia's 24.5 million people.
Yet that performance was less impressive given Australia's relatively rapid population growth of 1.6 percent, twice the OECD average. GDP per capita rose only 0.8 percent for the year.

There was also scant evidence of price pressures in the report. The deflator for final domestic demand, a useful proxy for domestic inflation, was up just 1.2 percent for the year.

490,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>",Australia's Economy Grows Slower Than Forecast on Export Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy grew slower than forecast in the final three months of last year, underscoring the likelihood of the central bank keeping interest rates on hold.
Australia is transitioning toward services driven economic growth and away from mining, with the central bank keeping interest rates at a record low for more than 18 months to support the transition. While businesses have boosted investment and hiring, including a record 300,000 full-time jobs last year, unemployment is falling only slowly and inflation just creeping higher as spare capacity remains in the economy.
Households remain mired in record-high debt and weak wage growth that’s constrained spending. The government has stepped in to provide some support to demand with large infrastructure projects to help eastern states cope with a surge in population growth.
Meanwhile, China’s demand for Australian iron ore to produce steel for skyscrapers and apartment blocks is entering a more mature phase; at the same time, its burgeoning middle class is boosting demand for Australian education for their children and tourism as their economy also transitions toward services, proving a bonanza Down Under. 
Education exports to China were worth A$9 billion ($7 billion) in fiscal 2017, up 260 percent in a decade; and more than a million Chinese tourists visited Australia last year.
Australia’s central bank says it expects growth to accelerate this year from last, which should help soak up spare capacity. Still, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said earlier on Wednesday he sees no strong case for a rate move in the near term, adding that progress in the jobless rate and inflation will occur “only gradually.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest decline in six months in January and business spending on equipment appeared to be slowing after strong growth in 2017.
Factory goods orders fell 1.4 percent amid a broad decrease in demand, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That was the largest drop since July 2017 and followed five straight monthly increases. Factory orders rose 1.8 percent in December.
January's drop in orders was broadly in line with economists' expectations. Orders surged 8.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, fell 0.3 percent in January instead of declining 0.2 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods decreased 0.5 percent in December. 
That was the first back-to-back drop since May 2016. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, slipped 0.1 percent in January instead of edging up 0.1 percent as reported last month. 
Core capital goods shipments increased 0.7 percent in December. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data, while the dollar (DXY) held at lower levels against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes were trading slightly higher.
TAX WINDFALL 
Business spending on equipment is cooling after growing by a robust 4.8 percent in 2017. 
But it is likely to remain supported as companies are expected to use some of their windfall from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package to buy machinery and other equipment as they seek to boost sluggish productivity.
The Trump administration slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective in January. The tax cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar and strengthening global economy are expected to support manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Sentiment among manufacturers remains bullish. A survey last week showed a measure of factory activity rose in February to its highest level since May 2004. But supply constraints and labor shortages are emerging, which could hurt factory output.
In January, orders for transportation equipment dropped 10.0 percent, weighed down by a 28.4 percent plunge in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. 
Orders for machinery dropped 0.4 percent, the biggest decline since October 2016, after rising 0.6 percent in December. Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery tumbled 8.9 percent after increasing 5.0 percent in the prior month. Orders for motor vehicles fell 0.5 percent, reversing a 0.4 percent gain in December.
There were also declines in orders for primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components. But orders for computers and electronic products orders rose 0.5 percent.
Pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing, unfilled orders at factories fell 0.3 percent in January. That was the biggest drop in six months and followed four consecutive monthly increases. Manufacturing inventories increased 0.3 percent. They have risen in 14 of the last 15 months.

Shipments of factory goods increased 0.6 percent in January after advancing 0.7 percent in December. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.35.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates at record lows on Tuesday, as expected, and sounded less confident that the economy would grow at 3 percent or more this year, in another sign rates will likely remain on hold for months to come.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to ""grow faster in 2018 than it did in 2017"", as it entirely removed reference to expectations of ""above 3 percent"" growth over the next couple of years.
The change in rhetoric comes as analysts downgrade forecasts for fourth-quarter GDP, due Wednesday.
A Reuters poll of analysts last week showed economists expect GDP to have expanded by 0.6 percent on quarter and 2.5 percent on year in the December quarter. However, recent soft indicators have prompted analysts to trim these expectations to rises of around 0.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. 
""The RBA has definitely softened its language around growth,"" said Tom Kennedy, Sydney-based senior economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). ""I think the change means gradually and very slowly they're stepping away from the 3 percent target,"" he added.
""Wage growth has been low, consumption has been really weak since mid-2017, net exports have been weaker than RBA's expectations. So when you add up all the bits and pieces you get a small figure.""
Analysts are divided evenly on the chance of a rate hike by December, while interest rate futures <0#YIB:> are not fully priced for a 25-basis point rise until early 2019.
The RBA is one of the less hawkish central banks in the developed world. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates at least three times this year and the European Central Bank is seen stepping back from its massive asset buying program soon.
MIXED DATA
Tuesday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed a drop in rural exports and a jump in consumer and oil imports, shaving 0.5 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the quarter.
As a result, the country's current account deficit widened to its largest in over a year to A$14 billion ($10.89 billion).
The RBA acknowledged the slowdown in exports in the fourth quarter, calling it a temporary blip.
Adding to the dour mood, retail sales for January rose a tepid 0.1 percent when analysts had looked for a 0.4 percent gain due to weakness in clothing and department stores. Sales had dipped 0.5 percent in December.
Consumer spending accounts for around 57 percent of GDP.
Australia's brick-and-mortar retailers have been struggling amid cut-throat competition and as relentless price discounts fail to entice customers facing paltry wage growth and mountains of debt. 
One bright spot was the surprisingly strong spending by Australia's government, which helped offset the drag from weather-dampened exports.
Tuesday's data showed government spending rose 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter to an inflation-adjusted A$83.16 billion ($64.67 billion) lifting potential for growth.
Also contributing to overall activity in the fourth quarter was remarkable strength in retail and car sales.
""The GDP partials confirm a composition of growth in Q4 that is unlikely to continue in 2018,"" said RBC economist Sue-Lin Ong.
""Firmer domestic demand with a bounce in consumption will be evident while net exports will weigh on growth. We expect that to shift in 2018,"" Ong added, citing strong global activity and higher LNG exports.
""A softer housing market and subdued household consumption will likely temper domestic private demand. We retain below consensus household consumption forecasts for 2018 and 2019.""

495,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",U.S. service sector activity ebbs; orders at 12-1/2-year high,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed slightly in February, held back by a sharp pull back in employment growth, but a surge in new orders to a 12-1/2-year high pointed to underlying strength.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey released on Monday also showed supply constraints emerging. Suppliers are taking longer to deliver materials, order backlogs are building up and raw material prices are rising.
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index slipped 0.4 point to a reading of 59.5 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The survey's measure of services sector employment dropped 6.6 points to 55.0, while a gauge of new orders jumped 2.1 points to the highest level since August 2005. A sub-index for export orders increased solidly last month. 
Economists were unperturbed by the drop in services industry employment last month, noting that January's increase had pushed the index to unsustainable levels. They continued to expect solid job growth in February.
""The index remains loosely consistent with private services payrolls rising at a 200,000 monthly pace,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics. 
The Labor Department is scheduled to publish February's employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200,000 jobs last month, matching January's gain.
A strong employment report could cement expectations of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve at the March 20-21 policy meeting. It would also strengthen views that the U.S. central bank would raise its 2018 rate hike forecast to four times to three at end of that meeting.
Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher, pushing yields down as investors worried about a global trade war in the wake of President Donald Trump's announcement last week of plans to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) falling for the fifth straight day.
The ISM said 16 industries, including utilities, wholesale trade, finance and insurance, professional, retail trade and information reported growth last month. The two industries reporting contraction were arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services.
Businesses in the construction sector said ""lumber-related costs continue to increase as supply is also starting to become a problem."" The higher lumber prices could be the result of tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imposed by the Trump administration last November. 
There were also reports of rising prices in the finance and insurance, mining and accommodation and food services industries.
The ISM's prices paid index slipped 0.9 point to a still lofty reading of 61.0 in February. A measure of supplier deliveries was unchanged last month with the trend pointing to a slowdown. Backlog orders surged 5.5 points to a reading of 56.0.
""Further evidence of supply constraints can be seen in labor, which has been reported in short supply by nonmanufacturers for seven straight months,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

""For a perspective on the potential disruptions from tariffs, aluminum and steel were both reported up in price, for two and five months, respectively.""

Key Takeaways
The results from the Tempe, Arizona-based group extend the solid start to the year for services that account for about 90 percent of the economy and span industries such as retail, utilities, health care, and construction. The February index compares with a 57 average for all of 2017.
While the services employment index suffered its biggest one- month drop since 2014, the gauge is still in line with its average for last year. In addition, growth in orders and backlogs signals a solid pipeline of business, supported by a tight job market and elevated confidence.
A separate ISM survey last week showed manufacturing grew in February at the fastest pace since 2004. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum has added a headwind to the outlook. His move risks sparking a trade war that could lift inflation, hurt business sentiment and weigh on economic growth.

Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 2.3 percent year-on-year increase. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent monthly rise and a 2.1 percent annual gain.
Eurostat also revised upwards the data for December to -1.0 on the month and 2.1 percent on year from -1.1 and 1.9 percent respectively.

The data showed the year-on-year number in January was mainly influenced by a 3.8 percent rise in the sales of non-food products, an acceleration from 3.0 percent in December. Of those non-food products, sales via mail order and over the internet jumped 8.8 percent, up from a 7.5 percent rise in December.

Trump said on Thursday that the United States would apply duties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect U.S. producers. The European Commission called the step a blatant intervention that amounted to protectionism and it raised the prospect of counter-measures.
""The comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about introducing tariffs on certain products have not only alarmed the European Commission. Investors are also clearly reacting,"" Sentix researcher Manfred Huebner said.
Sentix's index for the euro zone dropped to 24.0 in March from 31.9 in February, undershooting the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 31.0. It marked the second consecutive monthly decline and it was lowest level since April 2017.
An index tracking Germany, the largest economy in the euro zone, fell to 29.1 from 36.2 last month. Expectations for Germany dropped to -2.5 from 5.5, hitting their lowest level since February 2016.
""The German growth engine is clearly starting to stutter,"" Huebner said, adding that Trump's protectionist rhetoric was clouding the mood among investors.
On Saturday, Trump kept up the pressure, threatening European automakers with an import tax if the EU retaliated in response to his plan for tariffs on metals.
Sentix also said that investors were disappointed by the coalition deal sealed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats. Both factors together put Germany's economic boom at risk, Huebner said.
The German government expects gross domestic product to grow by 2.4 percent this year from 2.2 percent in 2017.

Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, eased to 57.6 in February from 59.0 in January, reaching a three-month low.
The reading compared with the flash composite reading of 57.4. 
Service providers took their most optimistic view of the outlook for business activity in seven years. 
A sub-index monitoring the services sector fell to 55.3 in February, also hitting a three-month low.
Markit economist Phil Smith said two first two months of 2018, taken together, had seen a faster average rate of private- sector growth than the final quarter of 2017.

LONDON, (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic boom paused last month as rising prices took a toll on demand, but the zone remains on course for its best growth in eight years, a survey showed on Monday.
Growth was robust and broad, with countries across the region reporting expansion, welcome news to the European Central Bank as it looks to end its ultra-easy monetary policy.
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall indicator of growth for the euro zone, fell to 57.1 in February from January's 58.8 and down from the flash estimate of 57.5.
January's reading was a level not seen since June 2006. But the slight slip last month leaves the PMI well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The euro zone economy looks to have hit a speed bump in February after a stellar start to the year. It's too early to read too much into the February fall in the PMI, and some pull-back from January's high was always on the cards,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI was consistent with GDP rising at a buoyant rate of 0.8 to 0.9 percent, which at the upper end would be the strongest since the second quarter of 2010. 
Momentum in the bloc has peaked, according to a Reuters poll last week that predicted quarterly growth of 0.6 percent and said the ECB would drop its easing bias on stimulus by or at the June meeting [ECILT/EU].
Alongside growth, inflationary pressures also eased a little last month and the output price index dipped to 54.4 from 54.8. Inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February of 1.2 percent, well below the ECB's target of close to but below 2.0 percent, official data showed last week.
New business came in at the weakest pace in six months and with prices still rising, activity in the bloc's dominant service industry took a hit. That index sank to 56.2 from 58.0, below an earlier estimate of 56.7.
But suggesting February could be a blip, companies were more optimistic about the year ahead. The business expectations index climbed to a nine-month high of 68.2 from 68.0.

The Investec Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to 57.2 in February from 59.8 in January, a survey showed on Monday. 
The index average for the last 12 months was 58.6, and has remained above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since August 2012, when Ireland was halfway through a three-year financial bailout.
Growth in new export business registered its second-lowest pace in 15 months, but almost twice as many of the managers polled still expected higher new export orders than expected a contraction.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian firms paid out a record amount in wages last quarter as a boom in hiring bloated their pay bill, a much-needed boost to consumer incomes and spending power at a time when overall growth in salaries remains subdued.
Monday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed businesses paid out A$134.2 billion ($104.2 billion) in wages and salaries in the December quarter, up 1.0 percent on the previous quarter and 4.3 percent higher than a year ago.
Annual growth in the total pay bill was more than twice that of individual wages, reflecting the huge 403,000 net gain in employment enjoyed during 2017.
""It's mostly growth in jobs, not wages,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.
""At an individual level people aren't feeling it, but at least firms are spreading the money around between more people. It does add to incomes and GDP overall.""
Figures due Wednesday are forecast to show Australia's A$1.8 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by around 0.6 percent in the December quarter. That would see annual growth slow to 2.5 percent, from 2.8 percent, but it would still mark more than 26 years without a technical recession.
The mix of moderate growth with restrained wages is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is likely to keep interest rates at record lows at its March meeting on Tuesday.
Policy has been on hold since August 2016 and the central bank has shown no urge to hike rates anytime soon.
STILL HIRING
The appetite for labour also shows little sign of fading, with job ads holding at six-year peaks in February.
A survey by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group out on Monday showed the average total number of ads per week was 177,284 in February, up a brisk 13.3 percent compared to a year ago.
""Business conditions remain elevated, job security continues to improve and capacity utilisation sits at the highest since 2008,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank.
""This suggests further gains in employment and ongoing inroads into the unemployment rate, at least through the first half of the year.""
Monday's ABS data suggested firms could afford to pay all the extra hands, with business pre-tax profits climbing 19 percent in the December quarter, from the previous quarter.
Mining alone boasted a rise of 38 percent in profits as commodity prices strengthened, while tourism, manufacturing and utilities all performed strongly.
There was also upbeat news for the construction industry as ABS data showed approvals to build new homes surged 17.1 percent in January, far beyond forecasts of a 5 percent increase and recouping almost all of December's 20.6 percent drop.
This series has a pattern of wild swings caused by approvals for large multi-unit blocks, which ballooned 42 percent in January alone.
Yet the underlying trend is proving surprisingly resilient given the boom in home building is already five years old.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 54.2 in February from January's 68-month high of 54.7, but was still above recent trends and well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. 
Despite the figures being seasonally adjusted, many economists think the Lunar New Year effect is so sweeping that it inevitably clouds China's readings early in the year. This year the week-long holiday fell in February, which may have contributed to new business growing at the slowest pace in three months.
Many businesses start to scale back operations ahead of time before shutting for the entire holiday or longer. 
However, spending on consumer services was likely to be boosted by the festivities. The retail and catering sectors posted sales of 926 billion yuan ($146 billion) during the holiday.
The business outlook for the next 12 months picked up from a four-month low as new marketing strategies, upcoming projects and expectations that market conditions will continue to improve all supported optimism.
The findings largely echoed those in an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector released last week, and bode well for Beijing's longer-term goal of overhauling and modernizing its economic growth model to one driven more by consumption than heavy industry, investment and exports.
The government is counting particularly on growth in high value-added areas such as finance and technology.
The services sector already accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
Like China's factories, its services firms continued to face strong input cost pressures in February, though they have been able to pass on some of the burden to customers, raising output charges for a sixth month.
This points to a further improvement in firms' profitability, Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, in a note accompanying the release.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of solid but slightly softer growth, falling to 53.3 in February from the previous month's multi-year high of 53.7.
""Manufacturing demand still remained stable, service industry prices rose towards convergence, and the stable condition of the macro economy didn't waver,"" said Zhong.

Economists polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth will moderate to around 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017 as the property market cools and as authorities press ahead with a clampdown on riskier financial activity that is driving up borrowing costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses grew at the fastest rate in more than two years in the three months to February, despite uncertainty about Britain's prospects as it prepares to leave the European Union, the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday.
The CBI's monthly growth indicator - which is based on its surveys of how much businesses' output has changed over the previous three months - more than doubled to +20 in February, from +9 in January, reaching its highest since December 2015.
Growth was far above the long-run average across most sectors other than retail, the CBI said.
The weak pound and healthy global growth propelled manufacturing output, while business and professional services grew at their fastest since August 2015.
""It's good to see firm growth in the UK economy this month, and expectations of growth into the next quarter also look positive,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
""However, both businesses and consumers continue to grapple with uncertainty over the economic outlook and Brexit, so the government must help counter this by intensifying its focus on the domestic agenda,"" she added.
The upbeat survey contrasts with modest GDP growth of 0.4 percent shown by official data for the last three months of 2017.
Many businesses see the end of March as a crunch point for judging whether Britain can secure a transitional arrangement to preserve its existing EU trading arrangements for a temporary period after it leaves in March 2019.
Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Friday to show more flexibility in talks on future ties, saying Britain was ready to swallow the ""hard facts"" of Brexit but did not believe they prevented a successful trade deal.
Sterling fell sharply after Britain first voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and the effects are still being felt on the high street, where high inflation and sluggish wage growth has squeezed shoppers' disposable income.
Two well-known British retailers, Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin, sought creditor protection last week, and the CBI said retail volumes declined for a fifth straight month in February.
The CBI also said uncertainty around Brexit had been restraining business investment, particularly larger projects.

Looking ahead, it expects the overall pace of private sector growth to accelerate in the three months to May - up to +24 - driven by a strong pick-up in the retail and motor trades, and forecasts overall growth this year to be similar to 2017.

Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months held steady at 2.7%, while the five-year gauge was unchanged at 2.5%.
""Consumers based their optimism on favorable assessments of jobs, wages, and higher after-tax pay,"" the surveyor's chief economist Richard Curtin said.
Curtin indicated that the highest proportion of households since 1998 reported that their finances had improved compared with a year ago and anticipated continued gains during the year ahead.
“Economic news heard by consumers continued to be dominated by the tax reform legislation and net job gains, which was untarnished by the consensus view that interest rates would increase and stock prices would remain volatile,” he added.
“Although rising interest rates was seen as a reason to temper their longer term outlook for the overall economy, only a modest moderation in the pace of economic growth was anticipated,” Curtin explained.
According to Curtin’s calculations, the data signaled an expected gain of 2.9% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to show faster growth in the final quarter of last year than initially estimated, boosted by bullish capital expenditure, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The poll also found the Bank of Japan was seen as likely to maintain its current stimulus policies at its two-day meeting next week.
The economy was expected to have expanded an annualized 0.9 percent in October-December, revised up from the initial reading of 0.5 percent, the poll of 19 economists found. 
This would translate into a 0.2 percent rise on a quarter-on-quarter basis from the preliminary reading of 0.1 percent.
Finance ministry data out on Thursday showed Japanese firms accelerated their investment in plant and equipment last quarter, prompting economists to upgrade their economic growth forecasts.
""Higher capital spending contributed to the upward revision. Domestic demand recovery is likely to confirm the economy's solidity,"" said Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""We project exports will retain their rising trend and domestic demand including capital expenditure will keep its steady undertone. The economy will likely continue to grow moderately."" 
Capital expenditure, a key component of gross domestic product, was seen likely to have risen 1.2 percent for the quarter, better than the 0.7 percent of growth in the preliminary data.
Capital expenditure rose for the fifth consecutive quarter in October-December, affirming companies' willingness to invest.
Japan's economy, the world third-largest, marked eight straight quarters of expansion in October-December, its longest such run since a 12-quarter stretch of growth during the 1980s boom years.
The Cabinet Office will release the revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on March 8 Thursday (2350 GMT March 7). 
The poll also found the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its short-term interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent when policymakers meet on March 8-9. 
""Consumer inflation is moving in an upward direction but it is still far from the BOJ's 2 percent target. So the central bank is expected to keep the current level of stimulus next week,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The poll also expected a current account surplus of around 310 billion yen ($2.92 billion) in January, falling from December's 797.2 billion yen surplus partly due to higher oil prices. 
Japanese household spending was seen likely to have fallen 1.2 percent in January from a year ago, accelerating from a 0.1 percent slip in December, reflecting higher prices of vegetables and gasoline, the poll showed.
The finance ministry will announce the current account balance at 8:50 a.m. on March 8 Japan time while the internal affairs ministry releases household spending at 8:30 a.m. on March 9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's unemployment rate hit a 25-year low in January and job availability stayed at a two-decade high, government data showed on Friday, offering policymakers hope a strengthening economic recovery will nudge firms into raising wages.
Separate data showed core consumer inflation in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, accelerated to 0.9 percent in February from 0.7 percent in the previous month.
While inflation remains distant from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, Friday's batch of data underscore the central bank's view that brightening economic prospects and a tight job market will prompt firms to push up prices.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.4 percent in January, down from 2.7 percent in December and lower than a median market forecast of 2.7 percent, data from the Internal Affairs ministry showed.
That was the highest level since April 1993, when Japan's economy was still in an asset price bubble. 
""We're seeing a pretty big increase in jobs in markets that are expanding. It's in line with Japan's expanding economy,"" said Takuji Aida, chief economist at Societe General Securities.
""The jobless rate is likely to stabilize below 2.5 percent and underscore the view Japan is heading toward a sustained exit from deflation.""
The jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.59, unchanged from the previous month and matching the highest since January 1974. The median forecast was for the index to rise to 1.60.
The pick-up in Tokyo consumer inflation was driven by rises in hotel and package tour prices, reflecting robust demand from Chinese visitors to the city and Japanese tours to South Korea during the winter Olympic Games, the data showed.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 0.5 percent in October-December, posting its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s boom, thanks to robust capital spending.
But inflation remains distant from the BOJ's 2 percent target as companies hold off on raising prices and wages, citing uncertainty over the economic outlook.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more to spur consumer spending, piling pressure on firms to spend their some their huge hoards of cash to broaden the benefits of the strengthening economy.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) 
People trying to escape soaring rents in U.S. cities face a cruel reality: home prices are going up, too. 
Still, many potential homeowners are finding that as expensive as it is to buy a house, now may be the last opportunity before mortgage rates start to rise.
Buying a home is more affordable than renting in only nine of 39 major metropolitan areas, according to research firm ATTOM Data Solutions: Dallas, Miami, San Antonio, Detroit, Philadelphia, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. 
Good luck affording either in the other markets.
This is why Amanda Wright, 35, and her husband Todd, 33, recently decided to buy in Seattle, where home prices rose more than 14 percent last year. 
“It’s a really challenging time for a buyer,” said Wright, a real estate broker. The financial planning rule of thumb is to spend no more than 30 percent of a family’s monthly income on housing, but “it is nearly impossible to follow that guideline now in Seattle.”
Residents in Seattle, on average, are spending 40.2 percent of pay for a three-bedroom rental, according to ATTOM Data Solutions research based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Department of Housing and Urban Development data. Buying the median priced Seattle area home at $613,500 demands 62.5 percent of pay.
In Brooklyn, people on average would spend 67.4 percent of their pay on rent, but buying the median priced home at $640,000 would require 110.9 percent of pay. In the San Francisco area, which has the highest income-to-housing cost ratios in the country, rent takes 79 percent of pay, and 136 percent of pay to buy the median home at $1.17 million.
At those prices, “renting is the lesser of two housing evils,” said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM Data Solutions. 
The good and bad news down the road involves mortgage interest rates. If they climb as expected to near 5 percent this year, home payments will cost more. 
Although that will price some people out of the housing market, it could also cause prices to decline as demand drops, said Blomquist. Early cracks in the housing market seemed to show up in January, when existing home sales fell 3.2 percent.
“Affordability is getting worse and something’s got to give,” said Blomquist. “Mortgage rates put more pressure on the affordable pressure cooker.”
Last week the average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.4 percent, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac, compared to 3.9 percent late in 2017. On a $380,000 home, that lifts monthly payments by about $100.  
Based on rates alone, a jump from 4 percent to 5 percent could cause the nation’s home sales volume to drop by 300,000, said National Association of Realtors economist Lawrence Yun. Last year about 6.1 million new and existing homes were sold. But, he said, a strong economy and job growth could mitigate a decline. 
Among those motivated to move now, before things get more expensive, is Ray Jess, 32. He was hesitant to stretch past that 30 percent ratio of income to housing cost after watching his parents generation struggle financially, but buying something won out. His starter home, which he purchased with his wife in Chicago last week, will be the first floor of a duplex.

“My wife and I were concerned that the longer we waited, the house we could buy would become less and less nice,” Jess said.

517,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",ISM Manufacturing Index rises to 60.8 in February,"Investing.com - The rate of growth in the economy's manufacturing sector unexpectedly accelerated in February, according to a report released on Thursday.
The Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 60.8 in February, from 59.1 the previous month.
Economists had forecast a decline to 58.7.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below 50 signals contraction.
The new orders index fell to 64.2 in February from 65.4 a month earlier.
The employment index rose to 59.7 last month from the prior 54.2. Economists had predicted an increase to 57.0.
The prices paid index increased to 74.2 in February, from the previous reading of 72.7. Analysts had forecast the reading to drop to 70.5.
“Comments from the panel reflect expanding business conditions, with new orders and production maintaining high levels of expansion; employment expanding at a faster rate to support production; order backlogs expanding at a faster rate; and export orders and imports continuing to grow faster in February,” the ISM noted.
Additionally, the report indicated that supplier deliveries continued to slow (improving) at a faster rate.
However, the ISM pointed out that price increases occurred across most industry sectors, while the customers’ inventories index indicated levels remain “too low”."
518,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 01:54PM ET</span>",U.S. monthly inflation picks up; jobless claims at 48-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, bolstering views that price pressures will accelerate this year. 
Those expectations were underscored by other data on Thursday showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week to a 48-year low as the labor market tightens. Another a survey showed prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials hit a more than six-year high in February.
The combination of rising inflation and a robust labor market could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates a bit more aggressively this year than currently anticipated as it worries about the economy overheating. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. The first rate increase is expected later this month.
""The Fed wanted to see more inflation and it looks like it is getting it,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""I am down for four (rate hikes) because the acceleration in inflation is not likely to fade anytime soon.""
The Commerce Department said consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.4 percent. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. The annual increase was, however, unchanged at 1.7 percent in January because of unfavorable base effects. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3 percent in January - the largest gain since January 2017. The so-called core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in December. Base effects also kept the annual increase in the core PCE price index unchanged at 1.5 percent in January.
The inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and has undershot the central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
Inflation is expected to rise toward its target this year also as a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending spur faster economic growth. Rising commodity prices as well as a weakening U.S. dollar are also seen stoking inflation.
""All the ingredients are in place. We are going to see inflation perk up a little through the rest of this year, but there is no cause for concern,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week offered an upbeat assessment of the economy, saying before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee ""my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December."" 
On Thursday, Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that there was no evidence of the economy overheating and also that ""the thing we don't want to have happen is to get behind the curve.""
The dollar initially firmed against a basket of currencies before surrendering gains to trade little changed. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose marginally while stocks on Wall Street fell.
CONSUMER SPENDING COOLS
In another report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of prices paid by factories increased to a reading of 74.2 in February, the highest level since May 2011, from 72.7 in January.
The ISM's overall index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 60.8 last month from 59.1 in January amid strong order growth and hiring. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
January's increase in inflation cut into consumer spending growth. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, gained 0.2 percent. That was the smallest increase since August and followed a 0.4 percent advance in December. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent, declining for the first time in a year. The so-called real consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in December.
The drop in real consumer spending in January suggests consumption will slow this quarter from the fourth-quarter's robust 3.8 percent annualized growth pace. 
It was also the latest indication that economic growth moderated at the start of the year after a 2.5 percent rate of expansion in the fourth quarter. Industrial production, home sales and core capital goods orders fell in January while construction spending was flat. 
Growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 1.7 percent rate. But spending remains underpinned by a strong labor market. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 24, the lowest level since December 1969. 
Consumer spending could also get a lift from the tax cuts, which boosted income and savings in January. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the tax package reduced personal income taxes by $115.5 billion at an annual rate.
Income at the disposal of households after taxes surged 0.9 percent in January, the biggest gain since December 2012, after rising 0.4 percent the prior month. 
Wages were also boosted by one-off bonuses that businesses gave workers as part of the tax-cut windfall. The saving rate jumped to 3.2 percent from 2.5 percent in December.

""This will give consumers the necessary fire-power to ramp up their spending in the months ahead,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December.
In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3 percent in January - the largest gain since January 2017. 
The so-called core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in December. Unfavorable base effects also kept the annual increase in the core PCE price index at 1.5 percent in January. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core PCE price index rising 0.3 percent in January and advancing 1.5 percent year-on-year. The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
Inflation is expected to breach its target this year as a tightening labor market boosts wage growth. Faster economic growth, spurred by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending, is also seen stoking inflation. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday offered an upbeat assessment of the economy, telling U.S. lawmakers ""my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December."" Powell also acknowledged that ""fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative."" 
Those remarks prompted traders to raise their bets on four rate increases this year. The Fed has forecast three rate hikes in 2018, but economists expect that will be revised up when the central bank publishes its projections at the end of the March 20-21 policy meeting. 
Higher inflation cut into consumer spending growth in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, gained 0.2 percent. That was the smallest increase since August and followed a 0.4 percent advance in December. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent, declining for the first time since January 2017. The so-called real consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in December.

It was also the latest indication that economic growth moderated at the start of the year after a 2.5 percent rate of expansion in the fourth quarter. Industrial production, home sales and core capital goods orders fell in January. 
But spending remains underpinned by a strong labor market, which Fed officials consider to be near or a little beyond full employment. Personal income rose 0.4 percent in January after increasing by the same margin in December. Wages increased 0.5 percent in January after rising 0.4 percent the prior month.
Savings increased to $464.4 billion in January from $363.2 billion in the prior month. The saving rate jumped to 3.2 percent from 2.5 percent in December. Savings in January were boosted by tax cuts, the Commerce Department said.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>","Gold as an inflation hedge? Well, sort of...","By Jan Harvey
LONDON (Reuters) - Rising inflation has put gold back on the radar for investors looking to protect themselves from emerging price pressures, but history suggests its reputation has been overstated. 
The experience of the last 50 years suggests gold performs better as a hedge against inflation shocks - like the spike caused by surging oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s - than the widely anticipated grind higher currently seen. 
""If you strip out the 1970s, you find the relationship between gold and inflation is quite weak,"" Brian Lucey, professor of international finance at Trinity College Dublin, said. ""That is because you have a very different inflation regime in the late 1980s and 1990s than you had in the 1970s."" 
""That was a time when inflation rates of double digit and higher were the norm. We're not going back to that.""
As U.S. consumer inflation surged to nearly 15 percent in early 1980, gold more than kept pace, hitting a then-record $666.75 an ounce after a fifteenfold rise over the previous decade.
However, when inflation rose again in the late 1980s, from 1 percent in late 1986 to more than 6 percent by the end of 1990, gold sagged. 
(GRAPHIC: Gold prices vs U.S. consumer inflation - http://reut.rs/2oweMS8)
While recent data suggests U.S. inflation pressures are picking up, central banks are poised to intervene if they start to rise strongly, chiefly through interest rate hikes. 
For gold, that is bad news. Rising interest rates lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion - why hold gold when you can be paid to hold cash? 
Only when inflation runs out of control, holding real rates, or interest rates minus inflation, in check, does gold tend to benefit significantly. Even so, a better hedge can be found in assets specifically designed for the purpose, such as Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), launched in the 1990s. 
(GRAPHIC: Gold vs real interest rates - http://reut.rs/2CrEEHk)
""If you want to cover inflation expectations, you just buy a bond - it's very straightforward,"" Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, said. ""However, that doesn't work for unexpected inflation – this is where an inflation-linked bond is needed.""
Harvey's research into gold's link with inflation shows that while the metal holds its value over the extremely long run - Roman soldiers' wages, expressed in gold, are similar to modern-day U.S. military pay - short-term investors seeking protection are likely to be disappointed.
""The inflation hedging abilities of gold are not measured over months or years, but centuries,"" he said. ""People mistake the very long term performance for the shorter term, thinking gold is going to protect them. My research is very clear that an investment in gold is not a reliable hedge.""
Indeed, gold has reacted little to recent price pressures. As the five-year U.S. breakeven inflation rate hit its highest in a year last month, gold sagged as the dollar pulled off recent lows in anticipation of higher interest rates. 
(GRAPHIC: Gold vs 5-year breakeven inflation expectations - http://reut.rs/2GQa6NO)
Investors have plenty of alternatives to gold if they want to protect against inflation, from inflation-linked bonds and inflation-indexed options to real estate. 
But regardless of the alternatives - and even whether gold really does act as an inflation hedge - rising price pressures may be good for bullion prices if enough people are convinced they will be. 

""Because gold is a perceived inflation hedge, we will still likely see some allocation into gold leading up to inflation moving higher,""  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analyst Suki Cooper said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the unemployment rate in the euro zone was 8.6 percent in January. 
Eurostat revised down to 8.6 percent its data for December from a previously estimated 8.7 percent. It said that the January's reading was the lowest recorded in the euro zone since December 2008.
The number of unemployed fell to 14.111 million people in January from 14.121 million a month earlier.
In January last year, the unemployment rate stood at 9.6 percent, meaning 15.540 million people were jobless. 
The steady drop in unemployment levels in the euro zone coincides with a firm economic recovery which reached last year its fastest pace in a decade.
But the reduction of jobless has not been equally distributed across the 19-country bloc.
In Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, the unemployment rate rose to 11.1 percent in January from 10.9 percent in December, a poor reading just days before the country holds a general election on Sunday.
In Spain, the bloc's fourth largest economy, the jobless rate slightly dropped to 16.3 percent in January, while in Germany it remained stable at 3.6 percent. In France it was also unchanged at 9.0 percent.

Even greater differences were seen in youth unemployment numbers, with roughly one youth unemployed every three in Italy and Spain, against a 6.6 percent rate in Germany.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 170.8 points, up 1.1 percent from January.
Food prices on international markets were 2.7 percent lower than last February, FAO said. 
Agricultural commodities have emerged from a highly volatile period and FAO has said it expects them to remain stable over the next decade.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 55.2 in February, compared to forecasts for a reading of 55.1.
The prior month’s reading was 55.3.
IHS Markit highlighted that the reading hit an eight-month low in February as slower output growth offset stronger new order inflows.
IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said the survey provided mixed signals over the health of the British manufacturing sector that suggested a 0.4% pace of growth.
Dobson pointed to the largest monthly gain since November in new orders and the fact that the expansion is continuing for its largest extent in more than a decade.
“Stocks of finished goods fell, raising the forward looking new orders to inventory ratio, while companies remained sufficiently confident in the outlook to take on more staff,” Dobson added.
On the inflation front, this expert noted that average input costs rose sharply during the month as manufacturers saw price increases in a broad range of commodities and raw materials. He indicated that part of the increase was passed onto clients. 
“However, rates of inflation in both price measures were slower than those signalled in the prior survey month,” Dobson concluded."

LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The euro zone's manufacturing boom slowed a little further last month but factories across the bloc still appear to be enjoying their best growth spell in almost two decades, a survey showed on Thursday.
Evidence the recovery remains robust and widespread, alongside price pressures at a near seven-year high, will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank as they move closer to unwinding their ultra-easy monetary policy.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone fell to 58.6 in February from 59.6, just pipping an earlier flash estimate of 58.5 and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday fell to 59.6 from 61.1, but was also above its flash estimate.
""The average PMI for the first quarter so far is the second-highest since the spring of 2000, falling just short of the near-record peak seen in the fourth quarter of last year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The broad-based nature of the upturn is especially welcome, with all surveyed countries reporting solid rates of expansion.""
That robust growth came despite a sub-index measuring output prices rising to 58.4 from 58.0, its highest reading since April 2011.
""Widespread cases of demand exceeding supply highlight the ongoing presence of solid underlying core inflationary pressures,"" Williamson said.
However, euro zone inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February, official data showed on Wednesday, underlining the ECB's caution in removing stimulus despite growth exceeding expectations.

Prices across the bloc rose 1.2 percent last month, a long way below the ECB's 2.0 percent target ceiling.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Confidence in South Africa's economy will get a boost after Monday's cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa returned trusted hands to crucial budget-related ministries, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Seventeen of the 20 economists surveyed in the past three days said Monday's reshuffle would have a significant positive impact on South Africa's economic confidence this year. 
One economist said it would be very significant, while the remaining two said it would have an insignificant impact.
In that same sample, 18 indicated they were optimistic the country's business sector would play a bigger part in job creation in the next two years. One economist was very optimistic while the remaining one was pessimistic.
""Both business and consumer confidence is likely to be boosted by the election of Cyril Ramaphosa to President of the Republic and the cabinet reshuffle that (followed),"" said Jeffrey Schultz, economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in Johannesburg.
South Africa's business confidence rose for a third month in a row in January to its highest since late 2015, on expectations the new leadership of the ruling party would stabilize economic policy, a survey showed last month.
""President Ramaphosa clearly has his sights set on improving the domestic business climate and promoting more public-private sector participation,"" said Schultz.
Gross domestic fixed investment - normally capital spending, such as buying new machinery for future production - fell into a recession in 2016, recovering only slightly early last year before hitting another slump in the second quarter.
The private sector makes up nearly two-thirds of the gross domestic fixed investment contribution to GDP, although it has played a smaller role in recent years, with government pushing infrastructure projects to raise jobs.
Schultz added that it would take some time for the trust between business and the government to be rebuilt, but it was clear the new government has realized it needs business sector buy-in to get growth and reduce unemployment.
Unemployment was at just over 20 percent a decade ago and now more than a quarter of South Africa's labor force is jobless.
OLD TRUSTED HANDS BACK AT HELM
Ramaphosa appointed Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister on Monday and Pravin Gordhan as public enterprise minister. All but one of the 20 economists polled singled out these two National Executive appointments as most likely to inspire economic confidence.
Both Nene and Gordhan served as finance ministers in the last administration but were unceremoniously sacked by former President Jacob Zuma.
A poll last month suggested South Africa's new leadership would need to be prudent and creative in managing the economy to avoid a credit rating downgrade, by raising taxes without suffocating a chance for growth. 
Moody's is due to publish a review later this month, which economists said in February would offer the country a reprieve.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",China February factory growth picks up to six-month high: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a six-month high in February as factories rushed to replenish inventories to meet rising new orders, a private survey showed on Thursday.
The findings were largely at odds with a downbeat official factory activity reading on Wednesday, which raised concerns of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the world's second biggest economy this year.
But both surveys showed a marked strengthening in business confidence for the next 12 months, suggesting many Chinese companies see any softening in conditions as temporary, likely due to disruptions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year holidays last month.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) edged up to 51.6 last month, from 51.5 in January, and countering economists' expectations for a slight dip to 51.3. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
The Caixin survey focuses more on small and mid-sized companies, and possibly more export-oriented firms, than the larger official version.
But regardless of size, many factories and offices start to scale back operations ahead of time before shutting for the entire holiday or longer, while some manufacturers front-load shipments or replenish inventories ahead of the break.
That often leaves investors without a clear picture of China's economic health until March.
Economists have largest forecast GDP growth will moderate to 6.5 percent this year from a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017, dragged by a cooling property market and a crackdown on riskier financing that is slowly pushing up borrowing costs.
The government is expected to announce next week a growth target of around 6.5 percent, the same as last year.
BUILDING UP STOCKS, BUILDING UP ENTHUSIASM
While both the private and official surveys showed factory output cooled in February, the loss of momentum was much more modest for companies surveyed in the Caixin report.
The Caixin PMI also pointed to a pick-up in total new orders, which prompted firms to rebuild inventories of raw materials. Expectations of a further improvement in client demand helped push business sentiment to an 11-month high.
""The stocks of finished products and stocks of purchases indices showed increases in the range that indicates economic expansion, reflecting that companies were making active preparations to start work in March,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
Companies continued to face rising input prices, however, and shed staff at the fastest rate in three months to reduce costs.
China's vast industrial sector reported strong earnings growth last year thanks to a year-long construction boom and resurgent exports.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales slide 4.7 percent in January,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly declined in January to their lowest level in more than three years, another sign that the housing market appears to be losing some momentum.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index dropped to a reading of 104.6, down 4.7 percent from the prior month. December's index was also downwardly revised to 109.8.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.3 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
The housing market has stumbled at the turn of the year. Sales of both new single-family homes and previously owned homes fell for a second straight month in January.
Near-record low inventory has hampered home sales, pushing up prices and making properties at the lower end of the market unaffordable to some first-time buyers. 
Mortgage rates have also risen to a four-year high while economists worry a cap on the mortgage interest deduction in the new tax code could slow housing demand this year.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 3.8 percent to the lowest level since October 2014. Last month, contracts in all four major regions fell with the biggest decline recorded in the Northeast, which saw a drop of 9.0 percent.

""The economy is in great shape, most local job markets are very strong and incomes are slowly rising, but there’s little doubt last month's retreat in contract signings occurred because of woefully low supply levels and the sudden increase in mortgage rates,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.

Pending home sales, or signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, fell 4.7%, down from a 0.5% gain in the previous month.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.4% last month.

531,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Fourth-Quarter Growth Revised Down to 2.5% Annual Pace,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy’s growth rate last quarter was revised slightly downward as inventories subtracted more than previously estimated, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday.
Key Takeaways
The latest results for GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., show the economy ended the year on a solid note, despite the downward revision. Household and business spending remained robust.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, was the biggest contributor of growth in the fourth quarter, adding 2.58 percentage points. The report also showed wages and salaries were revised higher for the third and fourth quarters. Pay increased $97.4 billion in the third quarter, an upward revision of $18.3 billion. Fourth-quarter wages were revised up to $91.3 billion.
Business outlays were also solid, contributing 0.82 percentage point to growth. The latest results were boosted by residential investment and government spending as well.
Final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out trade and inventories -- the two most volatile components of the GDP calculation -- climbed an unrevised 4.3 percent, the strongest since the third quarter of 2014.
Price data in the GDP report showed inflation near the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal. Excluding food and energy, the Fed’s preferred price index tied to personal spending rose an unrevised 1.9 percent.

MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer fell to 61.9 from 65.7 in the previous month. It was the lowest reading since August 2017.
Economists had expected the barometer to decline to 64.2.
On the scale, any reading above 50 indicates improving conditions.
“Disruptive weather conditions this month and large promotions at the back-end of last year appear to have weighed on demand and output in February, but despite the Barometer’s broad-based decline activity remains upbeat,” said Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators.
The Chicago purchasing managers’ index measures business conditions across the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana and Michigan and is seen as an indicator for U.S. manufacturing activity."
533,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>",Surge in imports helps curb U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter after the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years depleted inventories and drew in imports as businesses struggled to produce enough goods and services.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2017, instead of the previously reported 2.6 percent pace, the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate on Wednesday. That was a deceleration from the third quarter's brisk 3.2 percent pace.
(For an interactive graphic on U.S. GDP click http://tmsnrt.rs/1jLPbzV) 
The downward revision to the fourth-quarter growth estimate largely reflected a smaller inventory build than previously reported. The reliance on imports to satisfy domestic demand could further widen the trade deficit and blunt the anticipated economic boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending.
Domestic demand grew at an unrevised 4.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace in more than three years.
""An economy that is at or beyond full employment ... cannot match this pace of demand growth and, therefore, must either sell from inventory and/or purchase from abroad,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The trade deficit is likely to worsen in the first quarter. Data on Tuesday showed the goods trade deficit widened sharply in January as exports fell, pointing to slower economic growth in the first three months of the year. 
The moderation in GDP was also underscored by other reports on Wednesday showing factory activity in the Midwest slowing to a six-month low in February and contracts to purchase previously owned homes tumbling 4.7 percent in January to the lowest level since October 2014. 
Retail sales, home sales, durable goods orders and industrial production have also declined in January. 
First-quarter growth tends to be weak because of a seasonal quirk, but output is likely to accelerate for the rest of 2018 as the fiscal stimulus kicks in. GDP growth estimates for the January-March period are as low as a 1.8 percent rate.
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, an acceleration from the 1.5 percent logged in 2016.
Economists believe the economy will hit the Trump administration's 3 percent annual growth target this year, possibly putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively than currently anticipated.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell struck an upbeat note on the economy before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, saying ""my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December."" Powell also acknowledged that ""fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative."" Those remarks prompted traders to raise their bets on four rate increases this year. 
The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for 2018. Financial markets expect the first increase to come in March. 
""Evidence of a strengthening economy and the potential for further acceleration fueled by fiscal stimulus are likely to keep the Fed on its prescribed tightening path,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The dollar (DXY) rose to a five-week high against a basket of currencies as investors continued to digest Powell's comments.
Prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds were trading higher, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. That was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2 percent rate of growth in the July-September period.
The acceleration in consumer spending stoked inflation, with the Fed's preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rising at an unrevised 1.9 percent rate. The rise in the so-called core PCE price index was the fastest in more than a year and followed a 1.3 percent pace of increase in the third quarter.
Imports grew at an upwardly revised 14.0 percent pace instead of the previously reported 13.9 percent rate. That was the quickest pace since the third quarter of 2010 and offset a rise in exports driven by weakness in the dollar. 
The resulting trade deficit sliced off 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter, the most in a year, after adding 0.36 percentage point in the third quarter.
Robust consumer spending also curbed the accumulation of inventories, which increased at a rate of $8.0 billion instead of the previously reported $9.2 billion pace. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.70 percentage point from GDP growth after adding 0.79 percentage point in the prior period.
Growth in business spending on equipment was revised up to an 11.8 percent rate from the 11.4 percent pace published last month. That was the best performance since the third quarter of 2014.
The momentum, however, appears to be slowing, with a report on Tuesday showing a second straight monthly decline in core capital goods orders in January.
Investment in homebuilding increased at a 13.0 percent rate, rather than the previously reported 11.6 percent pace, after contracting for two straight quarters. Government spending grew at a 2.9 percent rate, revised down from a 3.0 percent pace. That was the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India regained its status as the world's fastest growing major economy in the October-December quarter, surpassing China for the first time in a year as government spending, manufacturing and services all picked up.
Asia's third-largest economy grew 7.2 percent in the December quarter, its fastest in five quarters, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Wednesday. That beat China's 6.8 percent and a forecast of 6.9 percent by analysts polled by Reuters.
In a data set that some economists said had put an early interest rate hike on the agenda, India also edged up its 2017/18 GDP growth forecast to 6.6 percent from 6.5 percent. 
India's manufacturers and service industries have been struggling to overcome disruptions from the bumpy launch of a national sales tax in July.
In the December quarter, annual growth in the manufacturing sector however climbed to 8.1 percent from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter, while financial and other services grew at 7.2 percent from 5.6 percent. 
""Settling down of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms will boost growth in the next fiscal year,"" said Anita Gandhi, a director at Arihant Capital Markets. 
Some economists now anticipate the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is trying to balance concern over inflation with support for growth, could raise interest rates after its next policy meeting on April 5.
""We expect a rate hike from RBI, most likely at the August review,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist, ICICI Securities Prime Dealership, citing inflationary pressures.
The central bank has kept its key rate unchanged since a 25 basis points cut in August 
Retail inflation eased marginally to 5.1 percent in January from a 17-month high of 5.2 percent in December.
Urjit Patel, RBI governor, this month said the economic recovery was at a nascent stage and called for a cautious approach. 
BAD LOANS AND JOB CREATION
Wednesday's data is likely to be welcomed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Last week, he told industrialists that his government was determined to put the economy back on a higher growth trajectory, but it is still far from firing on all cylinders.
Modi faces criticism over mounting bad loans at state banks and a $1.77-billion fraud at state lender Punjab National Bank (NS:PNB), the biggest in the country's banking history. 
Meanwhile, he is trying to accelerate growth through higher state spending, including 2.1 trillion rupees ($32.4 billion) for the recapitalization of state banks, which are beset with mounting bad loans of nearly $148 billion.
He has stepped up spending on infrastructure and welfare projects to boost growth ahead of national elections in 2019.
This has widened the fiscal deficit for the year ending in March, to 3.5 percent of GDP from the 3.2 percent projected earlier.
Creating jobs for near one million youth entering the market every month has been a key challenge, and he raised import tax on near 50 items this month to support domestic manufacturers. 
In November, Moody's raised India's investment grade rating one notch, the agency's first upgrade in nearly 14 years, but cautioned against macroeconomic risks.
India grew at more than 9 percent a year from 2005 through 2008.
Higher oil prices and increased pressure on market borrowings from government have already increased bond yields and this is likely to hit private investment and growth further.
Growth in factory activity slowed to a four-month low in February as new orders eased and weighed on output after manufacturers raised prices at the fastest pace in a year, a private business survey showed on Wednesday.
Analysts said bad loans in banks and inflationary risks arising from high food and crude prices pose risks to growth. 
""There are concerns of a rising fiscal deficit and the possibility of interest rates rising further,"" Gandhi said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's jobless total fell more than expected in February and employment hit a record high in January, data showed on Wednesday, underlining the strength of a labor market that is fuelling a consumption-led upswing in Europe's biggest economy.
Data published by the Federal Labour Office showed the seasonally adjusted jobless total dropped by 22,000 to 2.393 million. That was way more than the predicted drop of 15,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.4 percent in February, the lowest level since German reunification in 1990, the Office said.
""The good labor market developments are continuing in February,"" said Detlef Scheele, head of the Labour Office. He added that employment within the scope of social insurance rose further and firms continued to look for more staff.
The solid labor market is likely to continue supporting a consumption-led growth cycle in Germany where a rebound in exports and increased company investments have recently kicked in as additional growth drivers.
In a further positive sign, seasonally adjusted employment as measured by the International Labour Organisation climbed to a record 44.54 million in January, separate data released by the Federal Statistics Office showed.
Household spending has become the main source of Germany's economic expansion as record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation pay hikes and low borrowing costs all help open shoppers' wallets.
However, a sentiment survey by the GfK institute also showed on Wednesday that the cheerful mood among shoppers darkened slightly heading into March, suggesting political concerns could be weighing on household spending.
GfK's consumer sentiment indicator, which is based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, slipped to 10.8 points going into March from 11.0 in February, which was the highest level since 2001. The March reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for the index to edge down to 10.9.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl pointed to the political uncertainty since last year's inconclusive federal election as a factor behind the drop in all three components of the indicator.
""The political turbulence surrounding the formation of a stable, viable government in Berlin may have unsettled consumers,"" Buerkl said. ""Despite this setback, consumer optimism among German citizens remains high,"" Buerkl added.
The GfK survey was conducted from Jan. 26 to Feb. 9, mainly during ongoing coalition talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), which resulted in an agreement on Feb. 7.
The GfK data followed other sentiment surveys that showed German business morale deteriorated more than expected in February as a stronger euro clouded the outlook of exporters and investor morale also fell.

The DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce expects the German economy to grow by 2.7 percent this year, which would be the strongest pace since 2011.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","Investment surge pushed French growth to 2 percent in 2017, strongest since 2011","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy grew by a stronger than expected 2 percent in 2017, its best performance since 2011, in a year marked by a surprise acceleration in investment from companies and households, official data showed on Wednesday.
Buoyed by rock-bottom interest rates, a broad-based recovery among euro zone peers and lower payroll taxes, French companies bumped up investment to meet surging demand and more confident households returned to the property market.
The 2 percent increase over 2017, a tad higher than the 1.9 percent initially estimated, means France outpaced Britain, which grew by 1.7 percent last year, although gross domestic product fell short of the 2.5 percent in the wider euro zone.
That marked a sharp acceleration from the performance of the previous five years, where the French economy flirted with stagnation, weighed down by mass unemployment and efforts to close a budget deficit via higher taxes.
The French government will take heart in the pick-up in investment, which bodes well for long-term growth.
Companies' investment increased by 4.4 percent, while households' jumped by 5.4 percent, mainly on the back of property purchases.
Although President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business government has pointed at surging confidence since his election, the previous Socialist government has been quick to claim its efforts to cut companies' payroll costs are bearing fruit.
The European Central Bank, whose bond-buying program has pushed interest rates to record lows, encouraging companies and households to take up cheap loans and mortgages, could just as well take credit.
However, despite a 3.3 percent rise in exports in 2017, foreign trade still shaved 0.3 points off French growth as a whole last year, because of a more rapid surge in imports, at 4.1 percent.
In the fourth quarter, GDP rose by 0.6 percent after growing 0.5 percent the previous three months, INSEE said, leaving its quarterly estimates unchanged.

Household spending has overtaken exports as Germany's main source of economic expansion in recent years as record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation pay hikes and low borrowing costs all help open shoppers' wallets.

GfK's subindex measuring income expectations fell 3 points on the month to a three-month low of 53.8, while consumers' propensity to buy dropped by 4.1 points to 56.3 which was the lowest since July.
The sub-index measuring overall economic expectations plunged to 45.6 points from 54.4 in the previous month, but it was still far above levels seen a year ago.

541,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",China Factory Gauge Shows Easing Momentum Amid Holiday Season,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s official manufacturing gauge fell the most in five years in February as the Spring Festival holiday curbed output and export orders fell.
Top officials are gathering this week to reshape the government, including top economic roles, and repeal presidential term limits to allow Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely. Policy makers also have been intensifying overhauls to address pollution and debt and are likely to unveil new economic objectives next week at an annual legislative meeting.
""It’s always very hard at the beginning of the year to make sense of how things are moving, so I wouldn’t read too much into a seemingly weak number,"" Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview from Hong Kong. ""We also had quite weak credit data in January and I think together this is indicating that we’re not seeing an acceleration, we’re seeing a softening of growth.""
China’s week-long Lunar New Year holiday often distorts data for January and February as the accompanying factory shutdowns and office closures fall at different times each year. This year’s national holiday was from Feb. 15-21, later than last year’s start in January.
History shows that the February readings are within the normal fluctuation for the Spring Festival months, the statistics bureau said in a statement with the data. It said business expectations have held up and manufacturing activity is likely to resume its normal pace.
""The holiday effect is definitely a key reason"" for the slowdown in manufacturing, said Iris Pang, an economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong. ""Combining the first two months’ data, it’s still a solid start to the year. Looking ahead, I think the overcapacity cuts will still be a major theme this year, only that the focus might be shifted to sectors such as cement and glass from steel and coal in 2017.""
Other gauges showed:
""This is the second month we see a decline in new export orders,"" said Raymond Yeung, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""This highlights the risk of a cyclical downturn in the global electronic supply chain and has a direct bearing on the regional trade outlook."""
542,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 10:57PM ET</span>",Japan's industrial output tumbles in January as inventories build up,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Slowing production of cars and electronics in January tipped Japan's industrial output into its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory.
Separate data showed retail sales rose less than expected in January as shoppers cut back spending on clothes, cars, and appliances.
January's production data and a trade ministry compilation of company forecasts for output in February and March suggest that Japan's economy will expand more slowly this year, adding to pressure on policymakers to find new ways to stimulate growth.
Slowing growth could also make companies and politicians even more sensitive to gains in the yen, which eat into exporters' profits and make companies less likely to invest or raise workers' wages. 
The yen  has risen around 5 percent versus the dollar this year, hitting a 15-month high of 106.30 on Feb. 15.
A ""flash"" preliminary reading also showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded more gradually in February as growth of new export orders slowed due to the yen's appreciation, further emphasizing the corporate sector's acute sensitivity to currency fluctuations. 
""Japan's economy will grow this year, but not nearly as fast as it did last year. Japan's government will try to stop the yen from rising, but they also have to worry about trade friction,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. 
The trade ministry data out on Wednesday showed factory output fell 6.6 percent in January from the previous month.
This was the biggest decline since a 16.5 percent fall in March 2011 and more than economists' median estimate of a 4.2 percent drop. Output rose 2.9 percent in December.
Output of cars and trucks fell by 14.1 percent in January because of weaker exports to the United States, a trade ministry official told reporters.
Car output also fell because severe snowstorms in January delayed deliveries of parts, the official said.
Production of construction equipment fell 7.8 percent, while output of electronic parts and devices fell 6.3 percent to adjust for high inventories.
Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 9.0 percent in February but fall 2.7 percent in March.
Companies expect output of capital goods to fall 8.0 percent in March, while the trade ministry downgraded its assessment of production to say it is only ""gradually recovering"".
Retail sales in January rose 1.6 percent year-on-year, less than the median estimate for a 2.1 percent annual increase and slower than a 3.6 percent annual increase in December as spending on clothing and new cars fell. Spending on home electronics rose, but at a slower pace than the previous month.
After posting eight straight quarters of continuous expansion to end-2017, Japan's economic recovery may be running out of steam, further undermining efforts by the Bank of Japan to boost inflation to its elusive 2 percent target. 
""While industrial output hasn't been the best guide to GDP growth in recent years, this (Wednesday's news) suggests that the longest stretch of uninterrupted expansion since the late 1980s will come to an end this quarter,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Wednesday fell to 50.3 in February, from 51.3 in January. But it remained just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
That would mark the 20th straight month of expansion for China's manufacturers, but the sharper drop may raise some concerns for China's leaders as they prepare for the start of the National People's Congress (NPC) next week where Beijing will unveil its economic targets for this year.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast only a slight easing to 51.2.
The index for output stood at 50.7, down from 53.5 in January as the Lunar New Year holidays disrupted factory activities, the Statistics bureau said. Total new orders also expanded much slower in February. 
The week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in February this year but January in 2017, tend to distort data early in the year. 
Many factories and offices start to scale back operations ahead of time before shutting for the entire holiday or longer, while some manufacturers front-load shipments or replenish inventories ahead of the break.
Some Chinese steel mills, in particular, are believed to be aggressively building up inventories of raw materials like iron ore so they can spring back to full production once winter smog restrictions are lifted in coming weeks.
However, in a sign that China may continue with the pollution crackdown, the top steelmaking city of Tangshan has proposed new restrictions on production once the current curbs expire in March.
A separate PMI on the steel sector dropped to 49.5 in February from 50.9 in January.
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturing and industrial firms helped the economy post better-than-expected growth of 6.9 percent in 2017.
A sister survey showed activity in China's service sector slowed to lowest since October last year in February. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.4 from 55.3 in January.
Spending on consumer services this month was likely boosted by the long celebrations, though the statistics bureau said property and financial services slowed. The retail and catering sectors alone posted sales of 926 billion yuan ($146 billion) during the holiday period.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.
Economists polled by Reuters expected China's economic growth will moderate to around 6.5 percent this year as the property market cools and as authorities press ahead with a clamp down on riskier financial activity that is driving up borrowing costs.
Analysts and financial markets are widely expecting the government to announce a 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent at the NPC, the same as last year.
A composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity stood at 52.9 in February, down from January's reading of 54.6, but stayed well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.

Retail sales also dropped more than expected. Even so, the economy’s export-driven growth trend remains intact.
Key Takeaways
Industrial production to meet export demand has supported eight straight quarters of economic growth, Japan’s longest expansion in nearly three decades. While output is forecast to have rebounded sharply in February, the economy ministry slightly downgraded its assessment of production from ""recovering"" to ""gradually recovering."" The decline in retail sales, while attributed at least partly to poor weather, underscores that Japanese consumers remain cautious about spending

545,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Mood among UK consumers and businesses cools in February: surveys,"LONDON, (Reuters) - The mood among British consumers and businesses worsened slightly in February, according to surveys on Wednesday that suggested the economy remains on a steady but slow course ahead of Brexit.
Britain's headline gauge of consumer confidence, compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission, slipped to -10 from -9 in January, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists, and not far from December's four-year of low -13.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's business confidence barometer eased to 33 percent from January's nine-month high of 35 percent.
The surveys suggested Britain's sluggish economic growth at the end of 2017 - despite a much stronger global pick-up - continued in early 2018 with little more than a year to go until Britain leaves the European Union.
Economists polled by Reuters expect Britain, Japan and Italy risk getting the title of the slowest-growing Group of Seven economy in 2018.
GfK said consumers' expectations for their financial and economic well-being edged lower in February, hit by worry about slow wage growth, high inflation and the combination of increase local taxes and higher official interest rates, .
Another consumer confidence survey - by polling firm YouGov and the CEBR think tank - rose in February but remained below levels seen before a sharp drop in November.
The YouGov/CEBR survey is partly based on perceptions of house prices and job security, unlike the GfK survey.
The Lloyds business confidence survey of 1,200 companies showed businesses had become more upbeat about prospects for the economy, although they were less confident about their own prospects.
Lloyds said there was little sign that companies were planning a significant pick-up in pay growth. Bank of England officials have said they see early signs that wages are starting to rise more quickly.
Also on Wednesday, the British Retail Consortium said shop prices fell 0.8 percent in the year to January, a steeper decline than the 0.5 percent drop in December.

""This is a further sign that we have passed the peak of the upward pressure on inflation caused by the fall in the pound in June 2016,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose to 130.8, compared to a reading of 126.2 forecast by economists.
The reading for the previous month was revised down to 124.3 from 125.4 previously.
The present situation sub-index rose to 162.4 from 155.3 in January, while the expectations sub-index rose to 109.7 from 105.5 previously.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
“Consumers’ assessment of current conditions was more favorable this month, with the labor force the main driver. Despite the recent stock market volatility, consumers expressed greater optimism about short-term prospects for business and labor market conditions, as well as their financial prospects,"" said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board.
""Overall, consumers remain quite confident that the economy will continue expanding at a strong pace in the months ahead.”"
549,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing, goods trade data point to slow first quarter growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in January and shipments barely rose, pointing to a slowdown in business spending on equipment and in economic growth early in the first quarter.
The moderation in growth was underscored by other data on Tuesday showing a widening in the goods trade deficit last month amid decreasing exports. The reports joined weak January retail sales, industrial production and home sales data in suggesting the economy lost momentum at the start of the year.
But overall economic activity remains supported by robust consumer confidence, which surged to a more than 17-year high in February. Rising house prices are also boosting household wealth, helping to underpin consumer spending.
""Growth this year should be strong, maybe even in the 3 percent range, but to get there, current business and consumer spending patterns have to change,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.6 percent in December. 
That was the first back-to-back drop in these so-called core capital goods orders since May 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these orders rising 0.5 percent last month. Orders increased 8.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.
There were decreases in orders for machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for computers and electronic products and fabricated metal products rose last month.
Shipments of core capital goods edged up 0.1 percent after accelerating 0.7 percent in December. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors monitored Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's debut testimony before the House Financial Services Committee.
Powell said the U.S. central bank would stick with gradual interest rate increases. Fed officials anticipate three rate increases this year.
The dollar rose to a more than two-week high against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the spread between shorter-and-longer-dated yields narrowing. Stocks on Wall Street were lower.
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SURGES
Spending on equipment is slowing after robust growth in 2017, which was partly driven by expectations of hefty tax cuts from the Trump administration, which have since materialized.
There is cautious optimism that companies will use some of their windfall from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package to boost productivity. The Trump administration slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective January.
""Last year's moonshot in business spending is showing some signs of returning to earth,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Economics in Charlotte, North Carolina.
In another report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit rose 3.0 percent to $74.4 billion in January. Exports of goods fell $3.1 billion to $133.9 billion. Goods imports slipped $0.9 billion to $208.3 billion.
The department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.7 percent in January. Retail inventories rose 0.8 percent. The weak core capital goods orders and larger goods trade deficit will likely weigh on first-quarter GDP growth. However, some of the impact could be mitigated by the rise in inventories.
The Atlanta Fed cut its first-quarter GDP estimate by six-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annualized rate. Growth estimates by Wall Street investment banks are as low as a 2.0 percent pace. 
""We still have penciled in 2.5 percent GDP growth this quarter, but we are growing nervous about what is looking to be an overly optimistic forecast,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Growth in the first quarter tends to be weak because of a seasonal quirk. 
In a third report, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 6.5 points to 130.8 this month, the highest reading since November 2000. The rise came despite recent stock market volatility and was largely driven by labor market optimism.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the most favorable since January 2001.
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, is pointing to further declines in the jobless rate and labor market slack. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
""Better job prospects, higher wages are pretty compelling sources of support for the all-important American consumer,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Separately, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 6.3 percent in December from a year ago after increasing 6.4 percent in November. Prices in the 20 cities advanced 0.6 percent in December from November on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Tight supply is keeping home prices elevated. While that is boosting equity for homeowners, it is hurting home sales. Sales of both new and previously owned homes fell in January for a second straight month.
""The inventory shortage has become so severe that December showed no slowdown in prices,"" said Joe Kirchner, a senior economist at realtor.com. ""This increase is likely evidence that unsuccessful summer home buyers stayed in the market well into the winter months in order to close on their dream home.""

In a fifth report the Federal Housing Finance Agency said its house price index rose 6.5 percent in the 12 months through December.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's economy seen moderating but expansionary budget to lend support,"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Strong consumption, as well as frothy stock and real estate markets likely bolstered Hong Kong's economic growth in the fourth quarter, but higher U.S. interest rates and easing China capital inflows may pose broader risks to growth this year.
With the economy showing signs of moderation, the government will probably announce short-term relief measures and capital spending initiatives to sustain growth in an expansionary budget on Wednesday, local media reported. 
As one of the most open and free economies in the world, Hong Kong's growth is highly reliant on capital, trade, tourist and investment flows from China. A surge in domestic spending, a rise in visitors from the mainland and improved retail spending helped ramp up GDP last year after a difficult 2016.
""We think private consumption is likely to remain resilient on the back of stable growth,"" wrote HSBC economist Kelvin Lam. ""More specifically, the retail sector, one of four main pillars of the Hong Kong economy, will likely continue to be supported by the recovery in tourist arrivals and stable domestic demand.""
Six economists surveyed by Reuters expected fourth quarter growth of 3.2 percent from a year earlier, down from 3.6 percent in the July-September quarter. The economists did not provide quarterly forecasts. The third quarter expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent.
The still-solid momentum in the final quarter will bring full-year growth to an estimated 3.7 percent - the fastest since 2011 - and up from 1.9 percent growth in 2016. 
The former British colony has seen brighter economic data in the past few months as buoyant markets helped boost consumer spending, prompting the government to raise its full-year growth outlook to 3.7 percent late last year.
Economists forecast the financial hub's growth to ease in 2018 to 3.1 percent. GDP figures are due at 0300 GMT on Wednesday, along with the budget for the 2018/19 financial year.
BUDGET
Financial Secretary Paul Chan is expected to unveil a more expansionary budget on a bumper fiscal surplus of more than HK$160 billion ($20.45 billion), according to global consultancy EY.
While Chan may resist calls for short-term sweeteners such as cash handouts, local media say he will focus on livelihood challenges including a widening wealth gap and improved medical support for the elderly.
He will also seek to help innovative and creative industries through tax incentives, a start-up fund and investments in sectors such as artificial intelligence, fintech and biomedical science, with the city seen lagging far behind rivals like the southern China tech hub of Shenzhen, and Singapore, reports say. 
With the current bumper surplus, the city's fiscal reserves have now swelled to around HK$1 trillion ($127.8 billion), according to EY. 
""The combination of two-tier profits tax rates regime, short-term relief measures and capital spending initiatives would likely boost 2018 GDP,"" Nomura analysts Young Sun Kwon and Minoru Nogimori wrote in a research report. 
Hong Kong has hovered near full employment with a jobless rate of 2.9 percent in December, the lowest level in nearly two decades since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. 
The property sector, however, is seen by analysts as a potential risk as U.S. interest rates trend higher and weigh on mortgage payments and household consumption.
Hong Kong's home prices have surged for 14 straight months, further exacerbating public discontent toward housing affordability in the city of 7.4 million.
In spite of official efforts to cool prices, analysts see a further 5 to 20 percent rise in prices this year due to liquidity and a severe supply-demand imbalance.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Though global demand for memory chips and petroleum products remained robust, South Korean exports were likely to have barely risen in February from year ago levels as the Lunar New Year holidays meant there were less working days, a Reuters survey showed.
The median forecast from the poll of 11 economists predicted 0.4 percent growth from a year earlier, the slowest since November 2016. Exports had posted 22.5 percent growth in January.
""There were 19.5 working days in February and 22 for last year, which must have significantly dragged down overall export growth,"" said Park Ok-hee, an economist at IBK Securities.
Preliminary data already released by the government had shown exports contracted 3.9 percent during the first 20 days of February, while imports rose 13.6 percent over the same period.
""By sector, semiconductors and petroleum products are likely to have sustained firm growth whereas demand for automobiles may have decreased,"" Park added.
The median prediction for imports pointed to 13.1 percent growth during February, partly due to higher global oil prices. Imports grew 20.9 percent in January. 
Bolstered by strong exports, January industrial production was likely to show a 2 percent rise, as there were more working days than there were in the same month last year.
Lee Sang-jae, an economist at Eugene Investment & Securities said ""firm exports and increased domestic consumption gave great support"" to the economy in January.
But, he warned that rising trade protectionism and the looming closure of one of General Motors' plants in Gunsan could weigh on factory output for February.
The U.S. Commerce Department recommended President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel imports, including those from South Korea, after slapping bigger taxes on washers and solar panels in January.
GM has announced it would shut down a plant in Gunsan by May, and decide within weeks on the remaining three plants in the country. The company is in wage talks with its labor union.
The poll put the annual inflation rate for February was seen at 1.2 percent, up from 1.0 percent in January.

Trade and industrial output data are due to be released on Thursday and Friday respectively, while inflation data will be out on March 6.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol ran his term’s last monetary meeting on Tuesday, keeping interest rates on hold and talking up the health of South Korea’s economy but warning of the cost of U.S. protectionism to Korea’s car and steel industries.
Lee told a news conference that the Bank of Korea was not obliged to follow a global withdrawal of stimulus measures, further cementing a consensus view that the bank's monetary tightening will be gradual after its last hike to 1.50 percent in November.
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee meets on March 20 and 21, with markets focused on the prospect of another Fed rate rise following its December hike. 
""South Korea's monetary policy is not decided automatically based on the monetary policy of the United States. Going forward, we will make our policy decisions comprehensively by looking at the economy, inflation and U.S. monetary policy,"" Lee said after the last rate decision before his term ends in March.
Lee reiterated that the risk of major capital outflows from South Korea wasn't significant, even if the U.S. policy rate were to rise above South Korea's. 
""It seems Lee was being extra careful with his words, more so than other times because it was his last (rate decision event), out of concern that if he gives any clarity on future policy moves, it could limit policy room for the next governor,"" said Kang Seung-won, a fixed-income analyst at NH Investment & Securities. 
The bank's decision to keep the seven-day repurchase rate  at 1.50 percent was expected by all 14 economists 
surveyed by Reuters.
Eight of the 14 economists surveyed expected the BOK to lift rates in May, with the others seeing a rise later.
Lee acknowledged the challenge from U.S. trade policies, saying South Korean industries that run the biggest trade surpluses with the United States would be hardest-hid by any stiffening of U.S. trade curbs. 
""For example, I think we can say the auto and steel industries would be representative of that,"" Lee said. 
The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel imports, including those from South Korea, after slapping bigger taxes on washers and solar panels in January. There is also the risk a strong won could hurt South Korea's export competitiveness.
Lee said General Motors' plan to shut down one of its South Korean manufacturing plants did not warrant a change in the central bank's economic outlook. 
""In the case of the GM factory shutdown in Gunsan, the factory operation rate is already very low and the impact of the shutdown on our economy overall will be limited. For the regional economy, however, the impact will be big.""
UNCERTAINTIES FACE NEW BANK OF KOREA GOVERNOR
But such uncertainties underscore the challenge facing the BOK's new governor who should be nominated by President Moon Jae-in before Lee's term ends on March 31. 
The new governor may soon be faced with prospect of raising interest rates without undermining growth or weakening consumption by households already saddled with record debt.
In November, the Bank of Korea raised the base rate by 25 basis points, its first tightening in six years. It sees the economy as likely to expand 3.0 percent this year, slowing slightly from last year's 3.1 percent. 
The central bank said its board ""anticipates that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy"".
Inflation eased to 1 percent in January, the slowest in 17 months, decelerating from December's 1.5 percent and undershooting the 1.3 percent seen in a Reuters poll of economists.
Such indicators have reinforced a broad consensus that the central bank's monetary tightening will be gradual this year as export- and investment-led growth moderates after 2017's rapid expansion.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",U.S. house prices to rise on strong demand and shortage of homes,"By Hari Kishan and Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices will rise at double the pace of inflation and wages this year as the supply of single-family homes falls short of rising demand, making housing less affordable, according to property market analysts in a Reuters poll.
Demand for housing has been driven by a strengthening labor market and a robust pickup in economic growth - but a lack of supply is holding back activity.
Analysts were evenly split over what would happen to housing market turnover this year. Fourteen of 36 respondents who answered an extra question said turnover would increase, 13 said it would be the same and nine expected it to fall.
Since a crash in home values - almost 40 percent - over a decade ago that spawned the financial crisis and a punishing recession, U.S. house prices have more than recovered all of those losses.
Lately, price rises have been driven by a lack of affordable homes coming to market, particularly a shortage of single-family homes which account for almost 90 percent of sales. Over 80 percent of 36 analysts said that is likely to continue this year.
""The key problem facing the housing market is the lack of homes on sale, especially the affordable ones that first time buyers are after, even though the labor market is strong and wages are finally starting to rise,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics.
After averaging over 5 percent growth last year, the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of U.S. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain a further 5.6 percent this year and 4.3 percent in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago.
That is well above predictions for wage growth to average 2.8 percent this year and for consumer inflation to be 2.3 percent, according to a separate Reuters poll. [ECILT/US]
When asked in the latest poll, conducted Feb 15-26, to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 7. That was in line with a similar poll on Britain's housing market. [GB/HOMES]
For the U.S., this is the first time since a poll in August 2014 that the median was higher than 6.
In January, existing home sales dropped at the fastest year-on-year rate since August 2014, down 4.8 percent to 5.38 million annualized units. They were forecast to average a touch over 5.6 million units for the rest of the year.
That is well short of over 7 million units during the previous housing market boom.
But supply could improve in the coming months as government data earlier in February showed the number of homes under construction surged to near a 10-1/2-year high in January. Single-family home completions were the highest since June 2008.
""Home building is increasing but remains below levels necessary to compensate for the level of demand,"" noted Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, a property database website.
Nearly half the property market experts in a December poll said the U.S. administration's tax cuts would make housing less affordable while a third said they would have no effect.
Making borrowing more expensive for buyers, the Fed is almost certain to raise interest rates three times in 2018, a Reuters poll found, even though some U.S. policymakers are still worried about weak wage inflation and overall price pressures.
And the risks are increasing it will deliver four hikes.
But a majority, over 60 percent of 36 respondents, said they were not concerned that the Fed would raise rates too fast this year and slow housing market activity significantly.
In the latest poll, mortgage rates were forecast to average 4.5 percent this year, 4.9 percent next and 5.1 percent in 2020.
""A lack of housing supply, rapidly rising home prices, and now rising mortgage rates will hold back housing market turnover this year,"" wrote Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.
Treasury yields climbed to 4-year highs, pushing 30-year mortgage rates to 4.4 percent, the highest since April 2014 last week, according to home finance agency Freddie Mac.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 12:46PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales hit 5-month low; supply highest since 2009,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell for a second straight month in January, weighed down by steep declines in the Northeast and South, which could raise concerns the housing market is losing momentum.
The weak report from the Commerce Department on Monday followed data last week that showed sales of previously owned homes dropped for a second consecutive month in January amid near-record low inventory. It also added to soft January retail and industrial production data in suggesting economic growth slowed at the start of the year. 
A severe shortage of houses, especially on the lower end of the market, is pushing up prices and sidelining some first-time buyers. Economists worry rising mortgage rates, which are near a four-year high, and a cap on the mortgage interest deduction in the overhauled tax code will slow housing demand this year.
""Given the softening in the housing data over the past few months as well as the recent increase in mortgage rates as well as tax changes that reduce the attractiveness of mortgage financing, we think it is very likely that real residential investment will decline in the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 7.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units last month, the lowest level since August 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for nearly 10 percent of the housing market, rising to a pace of 645,000 units last month.
Sales tumbled 33.3 percent in the Northeast to their lowest level since August 2016. They plunged 14.2 percent in the South, which accounts for half of the market for new homes, to a 13-month low. Sales rose 1.0 percent in the West and surged 15.4 percent in the Midwest.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They fell 1.0 percent from a year ago. Two-thirds of homes sold last month were under construction or yet to be built.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading largely flat, bucking a broadly stronger U.S. stock market. Shares of the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), fell 1.0 percent and those of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.3 percent. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose while the dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES
""The drop in sales may be due to saturation in the upper price range of the market, which should compel builders to follow the market and build more moderately-priced homes,"" said Joseph Kirchner, senior economist at realtor.com.
The weak new home sales means brokers are making less in commissions. As a result, data forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers trimmed its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.9 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.40 percent in the week ended Feb. 22, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.38 percent in the prior week, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. It has increased for seven straight weeks. Mortgage rates are increasing in tandem with U.S. government bond yields on worries about rising inflation.
In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent, despite the unemployment rate having dropped to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
In January, there were 301,000 new homes on the market, an increase of 2.4 percent and the highest level since March 2009. The stock of new homes still remains well below its peak during the housing market bubble in 2006. 
Unless builders shift toward moderately priced homes, the increase in inventory will probably do little to ease the supply crunch. Houses under construction accounted for 59 percent of inventory last month. 
""New homes usually come with a bigger price tag, something that can turn away many first-time buyers,"" said Bill Banfield, executive vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.

At January's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since July 2014 and up from 5.5 months in December. The median price for a new home increased 2.5 percent in January to $323,000 from a year ago.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's economy grew at its fastest pace in a year in the October-December quarter as consumers, businesses and the government stepped up spending, a Reuters poll predicted.
This suggests that disruptions from a shock ban on high-value currency notes in November 2016 and the chaotic launch of a goods and services tax (GST) in July are fading.
Gross domestic product  grew 6.9 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, according to the poll of more than 35 economists, taken over the past week. 
If the data, due at 1200 GMT on Feb. 28, matches the consensus, the quarter will have the best growth rate in 2017.
In July-September, the economy grew 6.3 percent annually, a return to a faster growth trajectory after five consecutive quarters of slowdown. 
In the latest quarter, ""government spending was stronger and private consumption demand was robust as well, as seen in strong growth in auto sales,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities PD.
""Recent buoyancy in indicators such as cement output also points to recovery in segments such as construction, and real estate that were hit most from demonetization.""
Still, growth in the world's seventh largest economy is far from the near-double digits pace recorded during the years before the financial crisis.
What has also weighed on the economy is exports, which took a hit last year from an appreciating rupee, which strengthened 6.5 percent against the dollar in 2017. 
While down around 1 percent this year, the rupee is not expected to weaken significantly, according to a separate Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists. 
CONCERN ON BANKING
Economists in the latest poll were also concerned about the increase in non-performing assets of state-run banks, and said if they are not handled effectively it would hurt economic activity.
Adding to those worries, the second biggest state lender,  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) this month revealed a loan fraud that's the biggest in India's banking history.
The fraud has cast a shadow over the workings of state-run lenders, already reeling from accumulated bad loans accumulated that are higher than those of banks in most major economies.
While stress on bank balance sheets is a drag and the clean-up exercise ""may still take time"", it's likely that economic growth should get better, Upadhyay said.
The poll also predicted India's gross value-added (GVA) - the growth measure that the government prefers - increased 6.6 percent from a year earlier in October-December from a year earlier, compared to 6.1 percent in the prior three months.
That should provide some relief to the Reserve Bank of India which is performing a delicate balancing act of monitoring inflation and nurturing growth.
Retail inflation  eased in January after a 17-month spike in December, but was still above the 4 percent medium-term target of the central bank.

While the RBI kept rates on hold at its Feb. 7 meeting, the minutes showed monetary committee members concerned about the rising inflation rate.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>",China's factory growth seen easing only marginally in February,"(This February 26th story corrects to say February is seen as the 19th straight month of expansion, not 20th)
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector likely posted another month of relatively solid growth in February, despite long Lunar New Year 
holidays and a tough pollution crackdown which disrupted factory operations. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)is expected to have dipped only slightly to 51.2 in February from January's 51.3, according to a median forecast of 29 economists in a Reuters poll. 
That would mark the 19th straight month of expansion for China's manufacturers, and reinforce consensus views that the world's second-largest economy will only see a modest slowdown in growth this year. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
But like much of China's data early in a new year, the trends may be distorted by the timing of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in February this year but January in 2017.
Many factories and offices start to scale back operations ahead of time before shutting for the entire holiday or longer, while some manufacturers front-load shipments or replenish inventories ahead of the break. 
Some Chinese steel mills, in particular, are believed to be aggressively building up inventories of raw materials like iron ore so they can spring back to full production once winter smog restrictions are lifted in coming weeks. 
""With external demand holding up, inflation mild, and labor cost stable, China's manufacturing sector is projected to be in relatively good health this year,"" said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Capital Securities in Beijing. 
""However, days are gone when the manufacturing sector had expanded rapidly. The PMI these days is only likely to fluctuate between 51 and 52."" 
China's trade machine kicked up a gear in January after stumbling the previous month, with exports and imports both growing much more than expected, pointing to a strong start to the year for global demand.
Economists polled by Reuters expected China's economic growth will moderate to around 6.5 percent this year from a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017 as the property market cools and as authorities press ahead with a clamp down on riskier financial activity that is driving up borrowing costs.
The corporate lending rate climbed 49 basis points in the first three quarters last year to 5.76 percent, before falling 2 basis points in September-December.
Economists expect a private survey on China's factory activity later this week will show a similar easing trend as the official reading, after activity in January expanded at multimonth highs.
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will be 51.3 in February versus 51.5 the previous month.
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from a year-long, state-led construction boom as large, government-owned industrial heavyweights.
The official PMI survey will be published on Feb. 28, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on March 1, with the Caixin services PMI to be released on March 5.

The Confederation of British Industry said volumes in the services sector as a whole grew at the fastest pace since August 2015 in the three months to February, and profits rose too.
""Despite feeling the pinch from high inflation, business volumes have bloomed, profits have grown for the first time in over two years and hiring is on the up,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
Britain's economy grew at its slowest rate since 2012 last year, as a boost from strong global demand failed to offset a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation triggered by June 2016's Brexit vote, official data showed on Thursday.
Services output in December was flat and up just 1.4 percent on the year.
But the CBI said businesses in its survey reported consumer demand had picked up after a decline in the previous three-month period, while cost growth was under better control.
Nonetheless, investment plans were muted, which the CBI blamed on uncertainty ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union in March 2019.
""Plans for expansion among business and professional services firms have turned downwards. Up and down the country, businesses are plainly worried at the lack of clarity over the UK's future relationship with ... the EU,"" Newton-Smith said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's annual consumer price inflation jumped to 3.0 percent in January after the government introduced a 5 percent value-added tax and hiked domestic gasoline prices at the start of the year, official data showed on Sunday.
The figures suggested the new tax and more expensive fuel, part of a government drive to cut a big budget deficit caused by low oil prices, had a large impact on Saudi consumer spending power in some areas last month. Consumer prices rose 3.9 percent from the previous month in January.
Food and beverage prices jumped 6.7 percent from a year earlier, restaurants and hotels gained 5.8 percent, and transport costs soared 10.5 percent.
However, clothing and footwear prices fell 7.9 percent from a year earlier, partly because of deep discounting by retailers battling a slow economy, while housing and utility prices rose only 1.3 percent. Residential rents are exempt from the tax, and the Saudi real estate market has been slumping. 
The statistics agency changed the base year for the consumer price index to 2013 from 2007 last month and adjusted the basket of goods and services, making direct comparisons with previous months difficult.
But the new tax and higher gasoline prices clearly pushed up inflation sharply. Annual inflation was just 0.4 percent in December, according to previously released data using the old basket. 
Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, estimated that if the statistics agency had continued to use the old consumer basket, annual inflation would probably have exceeded 6 percent in January - the highest level since 2010.
Among changes to the consumer basket in January, housing and utilities were given a bigger weighting, of more than 25 percent instead of 20.5 percent. The weighting of food and beverage prices was cut to under 19 percent from nearly 22 percent, and transport got a slightly smaller weighting.
The government has taken steps to ease the impact of the tax and higher fuel prices on consumption, introducing a system of cash allowances for medium- and lower-income households, and announcing an additional 50 billion riyal ($13.3 billion) package of handouts to citizens last month.
But Saudi inflation may rise further in coming months as consumer demand begins to recover from the initial shock of the tax, and as more retailers and companies raise their prices instead of absorbing additional costs.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast Saudi inflation will average 5.0 percent this year, after consumer prices fell 0.2 percent last year.
The United Arab Emirates introduced 5 percent VAT at the same time as Saudi Arabia, and data released last Thursday showed annual inflation in the emirate of Dubai rising to 2.7 percent in January from 1.5 percent in December.
The tax appears to be pushing prices up less sharply in the UAE than in Saudi Arabia because Riyadh, running a much larger fiscal deficit than the UAE and therefore more eager to raise new state revenues, did not exempt nearly as many goods and services from the levy.

The other four rich oil-exporting states of the Gulf -- Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain -- originally planned to impose VAT simultaneously with Saudi Arabia and the UAE but have not done so, partly out of concern about the effect on inflation and living standards. They may introduce the tax as soon as in 2019.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices grew in January although major cities saw early signs of softening, as the government continued its efforts to rein in speculative demand to fend off bubble risk.
The acceleration in prices across the nation suggests moves by provincial governments to support first-time buyers and upgraders by relaxing some purchase restrictions may be further fanning price gains in a market where fear of missing out is strong and mortgage fraud is rampant.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 5 percent in January from a year earlier and 0.3 percent month on month, according to Reuters calculations based on the data from the statistics bureau on Saturday.
The government removed the sales prices for affordable housing from the latest monthly calculations, distorting comparisons with previous months' growth data.
Prices in December grew 5.3 percent on year and 0.4 percent on month, based on data which included affordable housing.
The National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement that prices were ""stable while slightly lower"" last month, as eleven major cities fell year on year.
""The housing prices in tier-one cities reversed from growth to a decline and there was a slowdown in the growth rate in tier two and three cities,"" it said.
China's housing market has boomed since late 2015, giving a major boost to the economy, but is expected to gradually slow as measures to curb property speculation drag on sales.
The challenge for policymakers is to counter the risks from a slowdown in the sector and curbs to excessive borrowing without endangering a growth target of around 6.5 percent this year. A softening but still resilient property market, however, will be welcome news ahead of the annual parliament meeting in March where leaders will set economic targets for 2018.
The data marks the first price decline in tier one cities in more than two years, said Yan Yuejin, an analyst with Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute.
Purchase restrictions are also trickling down into lower-tier cities, while monetary policy tightening is leading to higher mortgage rates.
""Tier two and three cities will probably experience a similar decline,"" he said.
Those have started knocking some heat off the market. Property sales have slowed across three different tiers in January by more than 10 percent in 15 major cities monitored by China Index Academy, a private property research firm.
Official property sales and investment data for January-February will be released by the Statistics Bureau on March 14.
But demand appeared to be more resilient than expected amid government moves to support ""rigid demand"" of first-time buyers and upgraders by relaxing some purchase restrictions.
The central Chinese city of Wuhan, for example, announced a pilot program in February that allows first-time buyers priority in winning new home purchase bids.
Some analysts noted that China's housing market is becoming increasingly polarized, as prices in some smaller cities with no purchase restrictions picked up visibly but were flat or declined slightly month-on-month in most of the biggest cities.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe's largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018.
The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability.
Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot.
""The German economy continues to be in good shape,"" said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. ""Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.""
He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend.
The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth.
But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth.
Government spending increased, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth.
The finance ministry expects the economic upturn to continue at the start of 2018 and Ifo chief Clemens Fuest has said business confidence levels pointed to a 0.7 percent expansion between January and March.
That is despite the specter of a new election hanging over Germany if the SPD's 464,000 members reject a coalition with Merkel. The result of the SPD ballot is due on March 4.
On Thursday, Ifo's monthly survey showed morale among businesses weakening in February but remaining at a high level overall even though a stronger euro weighed on the outlook for exporters. Other recent surveys have shown private sector growth slowing and investor sentiment deteriorating. 
In a sign that household spending could pick up in the first quarter, consumer morale is at it highest since 2001, with Germans benefiting from record-high employment, strong job security, rising real wages and low borrowing costs.
The outlook is rosy according to Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. It expects the economy to expand by a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent this year -- the strongest rate of growth since 2011.

But there are numerous risks for the economy, KfW's Zeuner warned. He pointed to Britain's looming departure from the European Union, protectionist tendencies in the United States, increased volatility on financial markets and possible adverse effects from an unexpectedly strong euro.

Industrial production likely slipped 4.2 percent in January from the previous month, the poll of 19 economists found, after growing 2.9 percent in December.
""We expect the industrial production will retain its upward trend led by strong exports,"" said an analyst at Mitsubishi Research Institute in the survey.
""But if global financial markets enter an adjustment phase and if that is prolonged, its adverse impact could spread to the real economy."" 
Analysts are closely watching this year's sharp appreciation in the yen to see if it erodes Japanese exporters' competitiveness overseas and hurts their profits.

Retail sales, which will be released at the same time with the factory output, are forecast to have grown 2.1 percent in January from a year earlier, slowing from 3.6 percent growth in December.
Highlighting continued tightening in Japan's labor market, economists predict the jobless rate likely dipped to 2.7 percent in January while the jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen improving to 1.60, which would be its highest since January 1974.
Japanese policymakers hope that trend will soon translate into higher wages and stronger consumer spending, boosting inflation to the central banks' elusive 2 percent target. But a recent Reuters poll showed more than half of Japanese firms do not plan to raise base pay in annual wages talks this year.
Tokyo area's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely rose 0.8 percent in February from a year ago, led by energy costs and up only marginally from 0.7 percent in January.

China remains North Korea's largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen in recent months as the sanctions take effect.
Trade between China and North Korea totaled $215.97 million in January, down 52 percent from the year-earlier period and 31 percent month-on-month, final trade numbers from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday.
The United States has led an international campaign to tighten sanctions on North Korea to force it to give up development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of hitting the United States.
China has backed successive rounds of sanctions but has been wary of U.S. efforts to toughen these further and has been accused by U.S. officials of not fully implementing existing U.N. steps.
The Trump administration plans to announce on Friday what is being billed as the largest package of sanctions yet against North Korea to increase pressure on Pyongyang for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests, a senior administration official said.
China's exports to North Korea totaled $168.88 million in January compared with $257.73 million in December, while imports from North Korea were $47.09 million versus $54.68 million in December. 
Data set to be released by China on Saturday will provide more detail on imports and exports of specific products to and from North Korea, shedding more light on which shipments were affected. 

Beijing imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea, and exported no oil products except for a tiny amount of jet fuel, in December, the third full month of the latest United Nations trade sanctions.

573,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","China Is Said to Hold Conclave as PBOC, Policy Jobs in Play","(Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping will convene a Communist Party meeting within days to select China’s next government, including monetary and financial regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.
The party’s top 400 officials were expected to gather in Beijing ahead of annual legislative meetings next month, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. The session would approve personnel appointments and government restructuring decisions to be publicly ratified by the legislature, said three of the people, who requested anonymity because they’re not authorized to speak to media.
It would be the party’s third full Central Committee meeting since Xi secured a second five-year term as leader in October, underscoring the scale of his efforts to reshape the government. The committee hasn’t met so many times during the same period since the process was standardized four decades ago.
With current People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan expected to retire soon and a restructuring of the financial oversight system as yet unfinished, Xi now has an opportunity to install his favored candidates, potentially transforming the leadership of the central bank, as well as banking and insurance regulators.
The plenum will lay the ground for National People’s Congress meetings that start March 5, where the president, premier and other top cabinet figures will be formally appointed to new terms.
""It is quite rare to have a party plenum just before the NPC. It would be interesting to see the key personnel changes there, but clearly there is a leadership consolidation in the financial regulatory framework, indicating that deleveraging will take center stage over the coming year,"" said Zhou Hao, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
The State Council’s Information Office Friday declined to comment on the meeting, and the Central Committee’s International Communication Office didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment.
The strongest signal yet of Zhou’s impending retirement came in January
A personnel transition in the top economic and financial policy positions has implications for China’s current battle to defuse its ticking time bomb of aggregate debt -- which stands at around 260 percent of output and growing -- without crashing the economy. As China currently contributes around one-third of global growth, the appointments matter far beyond Beijing.
As Premier Li Keqiang is expected to retain his post, attention is likely to focus on Xi’s pick to lead the central bank, an institution that has garnered increased stature under Zhou and may take a leading role in the Financial Stability Development Committee created last year to tackle China’s unruly financial sector.
While current bank regulator chief Guo Shuqing and Hubei provincial party chief Jiang Chaoliang have both been tipped for that post, Xi’s top economic policy adviser and Politburo member Liu He has recently been named by analysts in connection with the top monetary policy job and a vice’s premier’s post. Such appointments would elevate him to an economic-policy status unparalleled since Zhu Rongji simultaneously led the PBOC and held a vice premier title in the 1990s.

Also being watched is the fate of former anti-graft chief Wang Qishan, whom the South China Morning Post newspaper reported in December was expected to be named vice president. Wang was selected as an NPC delegate last month, positioning him for another official role.
The Central Committee also met in January, when it approved the first amendments to the state constitution in 14 years, which also require the NPC’s approval. The amendments would add Xi’s governing philosophy, “Xi Thought,” to the document and allow the creation of a more powerful disciplinary agency to police public officials.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 10:59PM ET</span>",Japan's stagnant inflation set to keep BOJ exit from stimulus distant,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation was steady in January from a year earlier in a sign a strengthening economy has yet to prompt companies to raise prices, a challenge policy makers have yet to overcome despite years of massive stimulus.
Subdued inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain ultra-loose policy even as the economic recovery gathers momentum, suggesting it will lag behind its global peers in dialing back its crisis-era stimulus.
A recent Reuters poll showed more than half of Japanese firms do not plan to raise base pay in annual wages talks this year, and the recent market sell-off could give them further excuse to delay pay hikes.
That adds to growing challenges for BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda as he prepares for his second term in April with the central bank - bound by an elusive target - unable to withdraw stimulus even as the cost of prolonged easing rise.
""With wage growth still muted, a marked pick-up in service inflation is not on the cards,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. ""The upshot is that the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target remains out of reach.""
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in January from a year earlier, data showed on Friday.
That was roughly in line with private forecasts and matched the pace of gains in the previous two months, due mostly to increases in gasoline and fuel costs.
An index excluding the effect of fresh food and energy - closely watched by the BOJ as a measurement of demand-driven price growth - saw inflation accelerate to 0.4 percent in January from 0.3 percent in the previous month.
Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said the results reflect a tug-of-war between firms seeking to increase prices to pass on rising costs, and those wary of doing so for fear of scaring away consumers.
""This balance won't change for a while, so prices may not rise or fall that much for some time,"" he said.
WEAK CONSUMPTION
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 0.5 percent in October-December, posting its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s boom, thanks to robust capital spending.
But inflation remains distant from the BOJ's 2 percent target as companies hold off on raising prices and wages, citing uncertainty over the economic outlook.
While inflation has been absent or tepid in many advanced economies over the last couple of years despite a revival in growth, Japan is only just starting to emerge from nearly two decades of deflation.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more to spur consumer spending, piling pressure on firms to spend their huge cash pile to broaden the benefits of the strengthening economy.
There is scant sign companies will pay heed with recent yen gains threatening to hurt manufacturers' export-driven profits.
Slow wage growth could put a dampener on consumption, which has failed to show any sustainable gains in recent months. It rose 0.5 percent in October-December, failing to make up for a 0.6 percent slump in the previous quarter.
Some analysts say a recent spike in vegetable and grocery prices, blamed in part to bad weather, may also dent consumption.
Annual overall consumer inflation, which includes volatile fresh food costs, accelerated to 1.4 percent in January from 1.0 percent in December. That was the highest level since July 2014, when stripping away the effect of a 2014 sales tax hike.
Underscoring Japan's sticky deflationary mindset, major supermarket chain operator Seiyu on Thursday announced plans to cut prices of roughly 500 food items by an average 7 percent.
""There's a strong chance the recent sharp rise in fresh food prices is hurting consumer sentiment. That's why the momentum for demand-driven price growth remains weak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The road ahead for the BOJ looks rocky. As other central banks head for an exit, the BOJ could struggle to persuade investors it will be in no rush to follow in the footsteps of its overseas peers.

""As we have seen with the euro this year, it is the anticipation of monetary policy swings, not their implementation, that drives markets, and the BOJ has further to swing to achieve normalization than either the United States or the euro,"" ING chief Asia economist Robert Carnell said in a research note.

The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.40 percent in the week ended on Feb. 22, the highest level since April 2014. Last week, 30-year home loan rates had averaged 4.38 percent, the mortgage finance agency said.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims near 45-year low as economic outlook brightens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 45-year low last week, pointing to strong job growth in February and solid momentum in the economy.
The economy's brightening prospects were also underscored by other data on Thursday showing a gauge of future economic activity increasing for a fourth straight month in January. Labor market strength should continue to underpin consumer spending, despite a drop in retail sales in January.
""Firms are extraordinarily unwilling to part company with workers reflecting, in all likelihood, the difficulty of replacing them,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Feb. 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims fell to 216,000 in mid-January, which was the lowest level since January 1973.
Claims for six states, including California, were estimated because of Monday's Presidents Day holiday. While that probably distorted last week's data, the underlying trend in claims was consistent with a robust labor market.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims unchanged at 230,000 in the latest week. It was the 155th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Tightening labor market conditions are starting to push up wage growth, which could help to lift inflation toward the Federal Reserve 2 percent target.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Jan. 30-31 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers upbeat in their assessment of the economy and a number ""judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage increases at some point."" 
The minutes also noted that ""several others suggested that the upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity may have increased.""
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note retreating from a more than four-year high. Stocks on Wall Street rose after two days of losses.
STRONG JOB GROWTH
The Labor Department said claims for California, Hawaii, Maine, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming were estimated. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal, months after the territories were slammed by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250 to 226,000 last week.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. The four-week average of claims dropped 17,500 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month.
""With upbeat readings coming out of the initial claims data, we think job growth will likely be strong again in February,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs in January. Strong employment gains in February would seal the case for an interest rate increase next month. The Fed has forecast three rate increases this year. Most economists, however, expect four rate hikes in the wake of strong inflation readings in January.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 73,000 to 1.88 million in the week ended Feb. 10. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 16,250 to 1.93 million.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index jumped 1.0 percent in January after increasing 0.6 percent in December. The surge in the LEI reflected strong financial conditions, manufacturing, home building and labor markets. 

""The U.S. LEI accelerated further in January and continues to point to robust economic growth in the first half of 2018,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the Conference Board.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",ECB rejected even token change in policy message at January meeting: minutes,"By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers meeting last month rejected even a token change in the bank's policy message, arguing that it was premature to signal policy normalization given weak inflation, the minutes of the meeting showed on Thursday. 
Discussion over tweaking the bank's stance could still start early this year, concluded the ECB's Governing Council, which will meet next on March 8. But with inflation still not moving decisively higher they were wary about euro volatility and keen to avoid any disorderly market reaction to a shift in stance. 
The minutes suggest that rate-setters are in no hurry to adjust policy, even as markets expect the bank's unprecedented 2.55 trillion euro asset purchase program to finally expire this year, more than three years after its launch. 
""Changes in communication were generally seen to be premature at this juncture,"" policymakers said. ""Monetary policy would continue to develop... with a view to avoiding abrupt or disorderly adjustments at a later stage.""
""Some members expressed a preference for dropping the easing bias... However, it was concluded that such an adjustment was premature and not yet justified by the stronger confidence.""
The easing bias, a pledge to ramp up bond buys if needed, is seen as the smallest possible change in the bank's message --essentially a token adjustment, since few if any investors see bigger purchases ahead.
Removing this easing bias is likely to be the next move in clawing back stimulus, possibly as soon as March, sources close to the discussion told Reuters earlier.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) took a more conservative view, however, expecting the ECB to start adjusting guidance in April. It could first drop the easing bias, followed by tweaks to focus on the future path of interest rates. 
It expects the ECB's asset purchases to end in September, with a first rate hike in December. 
EURO
Highlighting a concern over the strong euro, policymakers said attempts by the United States to talk down the dollar appeared to jeopardize a decades-long deal among major economies not to target exchange rates for competitive purposes. 
""There was broad agreement among members that the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro was a source of uncertainty which required monitoring,"" the minutes added. 
Policymakers are especially sensitive to the euro's moves as any big rise in the currency could cut into inflation, threatening to reverse the impact of the stimulus the bank has been providing over the past three years.
""The language pertaining to the monetary policy stance could be revisited early this year as part of the regular assessment at the forthcoming policy meetings,"" the ECB said.
""While there was reason to be increasingly confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy were still warranted.""
The ECB has long flagged a discussion about changes in its communication stance for ""early"" 2018 but policymakers said they have not yet started that process and it was not yet clear if they would have such a discussion at the next meeting in March.
Markets have calmed since the ECB's meeting and U.S. officials have also toned down their rhetoric. While the euro is 4.5 percent higher against the dollar than six months ago, it has fallen around 2 percent lower from a recent peak.

Its downward drift to current levels is likely to comfort ECB policymakers who accept some firming is justified by the euro zone's exceptional economic run.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 05:41AM ET</span>",UK economy lags behind G7 after 2017 growth rate cut,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy was weaker than previously thought in 2017, official data showed on Thursday, leaving the country lagging further behind the global recovery as it prepares to leave the European Union.
The downgrade of the full-year and fourth-quarter growth rates also raised questions about the strength of the economy as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates. 
Gross domestic product growth slowed to a quarterly 0.4 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, wrong-footing economists and reducing 2017 growth as a whole to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.
This was still stronger than most economists feared immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. 
But the country has relied heavily on the unexpectedly robust global economy to sustain its economic growth while consumers have been squeezed by higher inflation caused by the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.
Sterling was little changed after Thursday's data and government bond prices rose slightly.
Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain's economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.
But Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.
""The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,"" he said in a note to clients.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.
Most economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year. 
LAGGARD UK
Britain's year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.
There were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.
Business investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.

The BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 01:03PM ET</span>","Tight supply, rising prices undercut on U.S. home sales","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell in January, leading to the biggest year-on-year decline in more than three years, as a chronic shortage of houses lifted prices and kept first-time buyers out of the market. 
The supply squeeze and rising mortgage interest rates are stoking fears of a lackluster spring selling season. The second straight monthly drop in home sales reported by National Association of Realtors on Wednesday added to weak retail sales and industrial production in January in suggesting slower economic growth in the first quarter.
""There may be some headwinds ahead for home resales with rising mortgage costs affecting how much the buyer can afford and this could put a damper on existing home sales and take some of the wind out of the economy's sails,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Existing home sales dropped 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month, with purchases declining in all four regions. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home sales rising 0.9 percent to a rate of 5.60 million units in January. 
Existing home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, declined 4.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in January. That was the biggest year-on-year drop since August 2014. The weakness in home sales is largely a function of supply constraints rather than a lack of demand, which is being driven by a robust labor market.
The shortage of properties is concentrated at the lower end of the market. While the number of previously-owned homes on the market rose 4.1 percent to 1.52 million units in January, housing inventory was down 9.5 percent from a year ago. 
That was also the lowest inventory for January on record. Supply has declined for 32 straight months on a year-on-year basis. At January's sales pace, it would take 3.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.2 months in December. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $240,500 in January, marking the 71st consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher, tracking a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar (DXY) strengthened against a basket of currencies as yields on shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries rose.
ECONOMIC GROWTH RISK
""It looks likely that real residential investment will decline in the first quarter and we see downside risk to our forecast for 2.5 percent real GDP growth during the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Making housing expensive for some first-time home buyers, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.38 percent last week, the highest level since April 2014, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. It was up from 4.32 percent in the prior week. 
Mortgage rates are increasing in tandem with U.S. government bond yields on worries about rising inflation. In contrast, wage growth remains stuck below 3 percent on an annual basis despite the unemployment rate being at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
""We have hoped that the rise in rates motivates home buyers to act soon but the move in rates may have been so drastic that they are now waiting to see if rates start to make a move down,"" said Brian Surgener, a senior vice president at BBMC Mortgage in Lombard, Illinois.
""Americans are not saving more and as home prices rise more of a down payment will be needed. So with more savings needed and payments increasing many home shoppers may be back on the fence until we see one of these trends turn around.""
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home decreased 6 percent last week from a week earlier. There are also worries that caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code could hurt demand for houses.
First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of transactions in January, down from 32 percent in December and 33 percent a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.
Economists expect supply to remain tight this year, which together with pricey home loans could result in modest home sales growth in 2018.
But housing supply could improve in the coming months as government data last week showed the number of homes under construction surged to near a 10-1/2-year high in January. Single-family home completions were the highest since June 2008.

In January, houses typically stayed on the market for 42 days, up from 40 days in December and down from 50 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in January were on the market for less than a month.

The trade figures also showed that Germany exported less to Britain last year, a trend that trade association BGA said would continue as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.
Germany's total trade with China rose to 186.6 billion euros ($230 billion) last year, from 170.2 billion in 2016, according to the figures from the Federal Statistics Office.
The United States, which was briefly Germany's biggest trading partner in 2015 when it usurped France, remained the biggest export market for German companies, however.
The data highlights the importance of both China and the United States for Germany, Europe's largest economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Germany's large global trade surplus and the data showed the United States had the biggest bilateral trade deficit with Germany last year, at 50.5 billion euros.
""Neither Trump's verbal attacks nor the stronger euro so far have put the brakes on exports to the United States,"" said Holger Bingmann, head of the BGA trade association.
Britain had the second-biggest bilateral trade deficit with Germany at 47.2 billion euros, and Britain and the United States together accounted for roughly 40 percent of Germany's global trade surplus, which edged down to 245 billion euros in 2017.
German exports to Britain dropped to 84.4 billion euros last year, from 85.9 billion euros in 2016, and means that Britain, which was Germany's third biggest export market in 2016, is now only its fifth most important market.
""The uncertainties created by Brexit have already had an impact and give a pretaste of what one probably will have to expect,"" Bingmann said. ""Already now, Britain has fallen behind two ranks in the list of Germany's most important export markets.""
France, which was Germany's biggest trading partner for more than five decades until 2015, is now in fourth place. The Netherlands became Germany's second-biggest trading partner. 
France's bilateral trade with Germany totaled 169.4 billion euros last year, but it remained the second-most important export destination for German goods with purchases of 105.2 billion euros, the data showed. 

China was the third biggest market with 86.2 billion euros.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth remained robust this month, with companies at their most optimistic in more than five years, a private-sector survey showed, despite indications higher prices and a stronger currency were taking a toll.
The euro zone emerged as one of the best-performing major economies last year, and its businesses started 2018 by ramping up activity at the fastest rate in well over a decade.
But February's preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) implied the pace of growth set in January, the fastest in well over a decade, has lost a little momentum.
IHS Markit's composite flash PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 57.5 this month, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which had predicted a more modest dip to 58.5 from January's final reading of 58.8.
Nevertheless, this month's reading was still one of the most expansionary - or farthest above 50 - in more than 11 years.
""The fall in today's PMI is not very surprising as recent levels have been far too stratospheric to be sustainable,"" said Greg Fuzesi at JP Morgan.
""There were encouraging aspects in the details, such as the resilience in the periphery and the only marginal fall in the composite employment index. Hence, we suspect that further declines will be measured."" 
Economists polled by Reuters expect the European Central Bank to end its asset purchase program by the end of 2018. [ECILT/EU]
IHS Markit said the bloc was heading for its best quarterly growth since the second quarter of 2016, with the PMI pointing to first-quarter growth of 0.9 percent, much faster than the 0.6 percent predicted in a Reuters poll.
Companies shared that optimism - an index measuring expected output in a year's time climbed to 68.3 from 68.0, its highest since IHS Markit started collecting the data in July 2012.
Consumer confidence in the bloc did fall more than expected this month, but that was from a 17-year high set in January, official data showed on Tuesday.
""The PMI indicates that the business outlook for the coming months has actually improved, it seems that the return of volatile markets has not had much effect on business confidence so far,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
CONFIDENCE
Earlier data from Germany and France, the euro zone's two biggest economies and the only ones to publish flash PMIs, showed business growth in both countries eased more than expected.
""At the country level, the survey pointed to a deceleration across the board. But the pace of growth remains strong,"" said Edoardo Campanella at UniCredit.
Although German business activity did fall to a three-month low, business confidence there hit a record high. Companies appeared to look past any uncertainty created by a failure to form a government in almost five months.
In France, the business outlook also continued to rise and employment growth came within a fraction of the 16 1/2-year high seen in November.
German bond yields fell to two-week lows after the weaker-than-expected data eased concern that ultra-easy monetary policy in the bloc could end sooner rather than later.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry matched the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll. It fell to 56.7 from 58.0, missing the consensus expectation for 57.6.
However, that weakening came as companies raised prices again, welcome news for the ECB as it moves to unwind its ultra-easy monetary policy.
The services output price index fell to 52.8, but January's 53.6 was the highest reading since mid-2008. Since the start of the year, the euro (EUR=) is up around 3 percent against the dollar, making the euro zone's exports less attractive.
""Although they weren't explicitly mentioned, we can surmise that those factors are coming in to play,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""These will inevitably contribute to slower growth, but at the moment there is no explicit factor we can put our finger on to say what has caused this slowdown.""
The manufacturing PMI dropped to 58.5 from 59.6, again matching the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll, against a consensus forecast of 59.3.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, sank to a four-month low of 59.5 from 61.1.
Adding to suggestions the strong euro may be having an effect, the export orders index - which does include trade within the bloc - fell to a seven-month low of 56.8 from 58.4.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment rose to 4.4% in the three months to December, up from 4.3%. Analysts expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.
The claimant count fell by a seasonally adjusted 7,200 in January, compared to expectations for a gain of 2,300 people. That follows an increase of 6,200 a month earlier.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.5% in the three months to December, matching forecasts and unchaged from the preceding three-month period.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.5%, above expectations for 2.4% and following a 2.3% increase in the three months to November.

Market research group Markit said that its Flash German Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors registered a reading of 57.4 in February, down from January's 81-month high of 59.0. It missed forecasts for 58.5.
Nevertheless, the latest reading was still among the highest seen since early-2011 and reflected robust, albeit slower, growth across both the manufacturing and service sectors.
The flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 60.3 from a final reading of 61.1 in January. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 60.6.
Factory output growth stayed strong but eased to a four-month low, the pace of expansion moderating further from December’s recent peak.
Service sector business activity likewise showed a slower rate of growth than that seen during the month before, when it had reached the highest since March 2011.
The preliminary German services purchasing managers’ index fell to 55.3 this month from January's near seven-year high of 57.3. That was below expectations for a reading of 56.9.

In the wider European Union, confidence also slipped - to -0.3 points from 0.4 points in January.

Europe's largest economy is powering ahead on a consumer-led upswing driven by record-high employment, increased job security, rising real wages and low borrowing costs. A rebound in exports and company investments are also boosting growth.
The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its monthly index of economic sentiment fell to 17.8 from 20.4 in January -- a smaller decline than the 16.0 forecast in a Reuters poll.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged down to 92.3 from 95.2 last month, which was the highest level since the survey began in 1991. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a reading of 93.9.
""The latest survey results continue to show a positive outlook for the German economy,"" ZEW researcher Achim Wambach said, adding that respondents' assessment of current conditions was still at a very high level.
Wambach said German economic growth was driven by good developments in both the global economy and private consumption. He noted, however, that inflation expectations for Germany and the euro zone as a whole had started to increase.
Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said the slightly weaker ZEW figures reflected a decline in equity prices rather than broader concerns about the economy.
She also pointed to political progress in efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives to forge a coalition government nearly five months after a federal election.
""The likely formation of a Grand Coalition government should mean some fiscal support for households over the next couple of years, which combined with a moderate pick-up in wage growth should boost household spending,"" she added.
Members of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) on Tuesday started voting on whether their party should enter a new coalition with Merkel's conservatives in a postal ballot which could scupper the chancellor's fourth term.
London-based Capital Economics expects the German economy to expand by 2.7 percent this year. This would be above the government's more conservative forecast of 2.4 percent.

The federal statistics office last week confirmed an earlier estimate for full-year growth of 2.2 percent in 2017 which translated into a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent, the strongest pace since 2011.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 09:51PM ET</span>","Australia central bank maps steady rate path, wary on mortgage debt","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank mapped out a steady course for rates at its first meeting of 2018 this month, stressing that a pick-up in wage growth was necessary to ensure a much-needed recovery in inflation.    
Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) February meeting showed policy makers had become more confident about the domestic outlook, thanks in part to a synchronized upturn in the global economy.
The RBA has left rates at 1.50 percent since August 2016, the longest spell of stable policy since the early 1990s.   
That had helped in reducing the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent and bringing inflation closer to its 2-3 percent target band, minutes of the meeting showed.
""Further progress on these goals was expected over the period ahead but the increase in inflation was likely to occur only gradually as the economy strengthened,"" the RBA said.    
""Even with the strength in the labor market, wage growth was yet to pick-up.""    
Just last week, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said he would like to see annual wage growth accelerate to around 3.5 percent, from the current 2 percent.    
The target appears ambitious as firms are reluctant to pay more, in part because they cannot raise prices.    
That, in-turn, is constraining consumer spending as households are sitting on a mountain of debt after years of speculating in the property market.
The combination of low wage growth and high debt means the RBA will stand pat on rates for a while yet. 
The average household mortgage debt-to-income ratio has risen to around 140 percent at the end of 2017 from nearly 120 percent in 2012, RBA data shows. 
""The more debt households have, the more sensitive their cash flow, and hence consumption, is likely to be to a rise in interest rates,"" RBA Assistant Governor Michele Bullock said in a speech on Tuesday. 
""Households with higher debt levels may also sharply curtail their consumption in response to an adverse shock such as rising unemployment or large falls in house prices, amplifying any economic downturn.""
Bullock, however, judged the overall level of mortgage stress among households was ""relatively low"" at present, in part because those with the most debt also had the greatest ability to fund it.
ENCOURAGING SIGNS 
There were also reasons for cheer.    
Data out last week showed Australia's streak of employment gains reached the longest on record in January.    
Figures on retail sales also suggested that the weakness in household consumption seen since early-2017 had not continued into the December quarter.    
In addition, government spending on public infrastructure had boosted non-mining business investment and was likely to support economic growth for some time.    
As a result, the RBA forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average ""a bit above 3 percent"" over the next couple of years.
Still, Lowe is in no hurry to put up rates, recently saying the Board saw no ""strong case"" for a move. Futures markets <0#YIB:> are not fully pricing in a 25 basis point hike until early 2019.

The RBA cautioned that a rising Australian dollar  could also dampen the outlook. The Aussie climbed 8.7 percent in 2017 and is already up about 1 percent so far this year.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>",Canada province readies housing plan amid affordability crisis,"By Julie Gordon
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The British Columbia government will unveil its long-awaited housing strategy on Tuesday, taking aim at skyrocketing real estate prices and soaring rents that have crippled affordability in the West Coast Canadian province, particularly in Vancouver.
The left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power last year with a pledge to improve housing affordability and its first full budget is expected to include measures to curb speculative demand, crack down on tax cheats and money laundering, and stabilize housing markets. 
Foreign buyers have been largely blamed for Vancouver's red hot property market, where the gap between home values and incomes has widened rapidly in the last five years, hitting levels well above any other major Canadian city, according to data analyzed for Reuters.
This decoupling is heaping pressure on the province to take action. Hundreds of people rallied on Sunday in downtown Vancouver demanding the government move swiftly to bring down home prices. But some experts say it is not easy.
""It's about balancing supply and demand without killing the golden goose,"" said Andy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University, noting British Columbia's finances are dependant on the booming real estate sector, and efforts to cool Vancouver's hot market could hurt less frothy cities.
British Columbia has passed five straight balanced budgets and it is the only Canadian province with a triple-A credit rating from all three international credit rating agencies.
""They're going to need to approach this with a tool kit rather than a magic bullet,"" said Yan.
Experts anticipate a mix of supply and demand levers in the NDP's new housing policy, including a speculation tax and a widening of Vancouver's foreign buyer tax, introduced by the previous Liberal government in 2016, to include more cities.
The median value of Vancouver homes jumped to 11 times the median household income in 2016, up from a ratio of 9.4 times in 2011, data compiled by Yan show. By comparison, the ratio for Toronto rose to 8.3 in 2016 and was 4.9 for Canada, which is skewed higher by the two cities, while 3 or less is considered affordable.
While Vancouver's empty home tax and restrictions on home-sharing services like Airbnb have helped slow detached home sales, demand for less-expensive condos has become frenzied, prompting some experts to question whether any new policy will be effective.
The Urban Development Institute, which represents developers, has warned the NDP against imposing too many demand curbs, pushing instead for incentives for purpose-built rental units and less red tape to promote more multi-family construction.
But critics say more supply alone will not help, as prices are already out of reach for people who live and work in Vancouver. Some are calling for an outright foreign buyer ban, while others want measures to ensure that global investors who buy through shell companies or local proxies, thus avoiding the foreign buyer tax, are still paying their share.

""Given that China has already restricted a lot of the capital flowing out of their country, I think we'd be better to focus on the money that is already here - that has been parked in our real estate industry,"" said Brad Barrett, who runs the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) activist group Vancouver is Falling.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 10:54PM ET</span>","Japan exports grow, manufacturers mood sours as yen rise clouds outlook","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Buoyant sales of cars and electronics led Japan's exports to a 14th straight month of growth in January but manufacturers' business confidence slid - highlighting fears of the rising yen disrupting an export-led recovery.
The trade data came on the heels of the Reuters Tankan survey that found Japanese manufacturers' confidence deteriorated sharply in February, pointing to global stock market turmoil and the yen undermining business sentiment.
Such variable indicators underscore the challenge facing the Bank of Japan's leadership trio – reappointed Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and two new deputies – as they work to stimulate the economy out of decades of stagnation.
The low mood of manufacturers in the Tankan survey was at odds with Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showing that exports grew 12.2 percent year-on-year in January, topping the prior month's 9.3 percent gain and economists' estimate of a 10.3 percent increase.
Monday's news also followed gross domestic product data out last week showing Japan recorded its eighth straight quarter of economic expansion over October-December.
A strong currency eats into Japanese manufacturers' profits and could disrupt the virtuous cycle of business investment, consumer spending and growth that authorities have struggled to set in motion.
""Our consolidated profits have deteriorated because of a strong yen,"" a manager of a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey.
Economists believe global demand should continue to drive Japanese exports and broader economy in the coming months, even though the rising yen clouds the outlook.
The dollar was down 0.4 percent to 105.545  on Friday, its lowest in 15 months.
Sustained yen appreciation of 5 percent would lower GDP-based real exports by 0.2 percent in the first year, 1.1 percent in the second and 1.2 percent in the third year, which may not be fatal but could not be ignored, said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""We don't forecast exports to sputter but need to bear in mind the risk that a strong yen may curb their driving force.""
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 29 in February, down from the previous month's 11-year high of 35, the survey conducted Jan. 31 to Feb. 14 found. The monthly poll closely tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan.
Monday's trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, jumped 30.8 percent year-on-year in January, due in part to an export surge before the Lunar New Year that happened later than last year. The gain was led by semiconductor production equipment, car engines and hybrid cars.
Shipments to Asia as a whole, which account for more than half of Japan's exports, grew 16.0 percent in the year to January.
U.S.-bound shipments rose 1.2 percent in the year to January, led by steel, batteries and medicines, while car shipments declined 3.9 percent. The small rise in U.S.-bound exports followed a 3.0 percent gain in the previous month.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 12.3 percent in January to 349.6 billion yen, a second declining month. 
The overall trade balance swung to a deficit of 943.4 billion yen ($8.87 billion), the first trade deficit in eight months.
""Net exports may return to growth this quarter,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Looking ahead, the export climate index climbed to a fresh high last month and suggests that external demand remains healthy. We've penciled in a 4.5 percent rise in export volumes this year.""

602,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Gearing up for rate hike, UK households turn gloomier on finances: survey","LONDON (Reuters) - British households' gloom about their finances deepened this month, and most now expect borrowing costs to rise again within six months after the Bank of England raised interest rates in November, a survey showed on Monday.
Data company IHS Markit said its Household Finance Index, a monthly gauge of financial well-being, fell to a seven-month low of 42.2 from 42.9 in January.
Conducted over six days starting on Feb. 8, the day the BoE said it was likely to raise rates sooner and by more than it previously thought, the survey showed 60 percent of households expected a hike within six months, up from 45 percent in January.
Britain's economy slowed in 2017 as higher inflation - fueled by the post-Brexit referendum fall in the pound - hurt the spending power of consumers. The BoE has said it expects the squeeze will ease in 2018 as inflation cools and weak wage growth ticks higher.
But Monday's report showed households are not feeling optimistic.
""The latest survey adds to evidence that UK households have seen an erosion of their financial wellbeing so far this year, with stubbornly high inflation the main factor placing pressure on consumer budgets,"" Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said. 
Households reported only a weak rise in income from employment in January, a possible concern for the BoE which predicts an acceleration of wage growth in 2018. Official figures on wages covering the three months to December are due on Wednesday.
Separate figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development showed that major employers expect to raise pay by less than inflation in 2018.
The median basic pay increase over the 12 months to December 2018 was likely to be 2 percent, unchanged from 2017, CIPD members from nearly a thousand employers said.
This contrasts with a BoE survey of major private-sector employers last week which pointed to pay rises of 3.1 percent this year - the biggest in a decade.
IHS Markit also reported a sharp drop in households' appetite for major purchases, chiming with data last week that showed retail sales volumes barely rose in January, capping the weakest three-month stretch since April last year.
A Reuters poll of economists published last week showed the BoE is likely to raise interest rates to 0.75 percent in May. [ECILT/GB]

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers worsened significantly in February from January's strong reading, the Reuters Tankan poll showed on Monday, suggesting the yen's strength and global stock market turmoil have undermined business sentiment. 
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found the mood among manufacturers was expected to brighten over the coming three months but service-sector morale was seen deteriorating, a worrying signal for the domestic demand-led recovery.
The Reuters poll of 544 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 259 firms responded on condition of anonymity, comes after Japan posted in the fourth quarter its longest run of economic growth since the 1980s boom, led by solid private consumption.
However, the recent global stock market sell-off has boosted investors' appetite for the safe-haven yen , which is a worry for policymakers.A strong currency eats into Japanese manufacturers' profits and could disrupt the virtuous cycle of business investment, consumer spending and growth that authorities have struggled to set in motion.
""Our consolidated profits have deteriorated because of a strong yen,"" a manager of a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey.
A metal product maker said: ""We are suffering from the repercussions of China's environmental regulation and restrictions on natural gas supply, which have severely affected manufacturers.""
Some other companies complained about profits being squeezed by rises in oil and commodity prices, while others said they were benefiting from brisk demand for semiconductors and cars. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 29 in February, down from the previous month's 11-year high of 35, the survey conducted Jan. 31 to Feb. 14 found.
The index is expected to rise slightly to 30 in May.
The service-sector index held steady at 33 in February, weighed by retailers, with heavy snow in some parts of Japan and widespread cold weather seen discouraging shopping. 
The index is expected to fall to 30 in May.
The BOJ's December tankan showed big manufacturers' confidence improved for a fifth straight quarter to hit an 11-year high, signaling broadening economic recovery from solid overseas demand and hefty corporate profits.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rose to more than a one-year high in January, boosted by strong increases in the construction of both single- and multi-family housing units, and further gains are likely with building permits surging to their highest level since 2007.
Other data on Friday showed a jump in import prices last month amid solid increases in the costs of petroleum and a range of other goods, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year. The bullish housing data suggested the economy remained on firmer footing at the start of the year despite weak retail sales and industrial production in January. 
""The economy is back on a winning path for stronger growth even if it is not firing on all cylinders with all sectors participating,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts jumped 9.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.326 million units, the Commerce Department said. That was the highest level since October 2016 and followed an upwardly revised sales pace of 1.209 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.234 million units last month after a previously reported rate of 1.192 million units.
Building permits surged 7.4 percent to a rate of 1.396 million units in January, the highest level since June 2007. 
A tightening labor market is boosting demand for housing, but rising mortgage rates and house prices could slow the momentum. Despite the unemployment rate being at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not exceeded 3 percent. 
In contrast, the annual house price increase topped 6 percent in November. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.38 percent this week, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.32 percent in the prior week, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates are rising in tandem with U.S. government bond yields on worries about rising inflation. 
INFLATION PUSHING HIGHER
The inflation concerns were underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing import prices jumping 1.0 percent in January after gaining 0.2 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, import prices rose 3.6 percent, the largest advance since April 2017, quickening from a 3.2 percent increase in the 12 months through December.
While prices of imports from China were unchanged for a second straight month, they increased on a year-on-year basis for the first time since October 2014.
""Going forward, we expect higher import prices to feed through to firming producer and consumer prices domestically,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.  
Data this week showed an acceleration in consumer and producer prices in January, which boosted expectations inflation will rise this year and potentially breach the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Inflation is expected to be driven by a tightening labor market, a weak dollar and fiscal stimulus in the form of a $1.5 trillion U.S. tax cut package and increased government spending. 
Higher inflation could prompt the Fed to be a bit more aggressive in raising interest rates this year than is currently anticipated. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases for this year, with the first hike expected in March.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers' inflation expectations unchanged in early February. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading 0.6 percent higher on Friday, in line with a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. Shares of D.R. Horton (N:DHI), the nation's largest homebuilder, rose 0.8 percent while those of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) fell 0.2 percent. 
The dollar (DXY) rebounded from a three-year low against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were mostly trading higher as investors bought back bonds after a selloff earlier in the week.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 3.7 percent to a rate of 877,000 units in January. Single-family home construction rose in the South and Northeast, but fell in the Midwest and West.
Permits to build single-family homes fell 1.7 percent in January, but the drop could be temporary. A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders hovering at lofty levels in February. Builders expected an increase in sales over the next six months.
Single-family home completions increased 2.2 percent to 850,000 units last month, the highest level since June 2008. While that rise will help to alleviate an acute shortage of houses on the market, single-family completions are half of what they were during the housing market boom in 2006.
""Builders have ramped up construction of single-family homes and completions should rise going into the spring selling season,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 23.7 percent to a rate of 449,000 units in January. Groundbreaking on multi-family housing projects with five units or more rose to its highest level since December 2016. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes soared 26.5 percent.

The preliminary publication of the data for February from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment rose to 99.9 last month. That was its second highest reading since 2004.
That was compared to January’s reading of 95.7.
Analysts had forecast the reading to slip to 95.4.
The current conditions indicator advanced to 115.1 in February, from the previous 110.5.
Economists had projected that the index would rise to only 112.0.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months held steady at 2.7%, while the five-year gauge was unchanged at 2.5%.
Chief economist Richard Curtin noted that stock market gyrations were dominated by rising incomes, employment growth, and by net favorable perceptions of the tax reforms.
“Indeed, when asked to identify any recent economic news they had heard, negative references to stock prices were spontaneously cited by just 6% of all consumers,” he said in the report.
“In contrast, favorable references to government policies were cited by 35% in February, unchanged from January, and the highest level recorded in more than a half century,” he added.
Curtin further commented that the survey showed the largest proportion of households that reported an improved financial situation since the year 2000 and that they largely expected higher income gains over the next year.
""Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.9% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018,"" Curtin concluded."

Housing starts jumped 9.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.326 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the highest level since October 2016 and followed an upwardly revised sales pace of 1.209 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.234 million units last month after a previously reported rate of 1.192 million units.
Building permits surged 7.4 percent to a rate of 1.396 million units in January, the highest level since June 2007. 
Demand for housing is being driven by a tightening labor market, but rising mortgage rates and house prices could slow the momentum. Despite the unemployment rate being at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not exceeded 3 percent. 
In contrast, the annual house price increase topped 6 percent in November. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.38 percent this week, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.32 percent in the prior week, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates are rising in tandem with U.S. government bond yields on worries about rising inflation.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","U.S. stock investors shrug off higher yields, for now","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spooked one week, sanguine the next. 
Some stock investors are drawing optimism from the market's ability to move upwards in the face of loftier yields - even though those higher yields were partly blamed for last week's violent selloff. 
Those investors are optimistic about economic growth, and stocks that can benefit from that environment, although they concede the overhanging risk that a sharp spike in yields could cause another rout. 
“Even though yields are moving higher, the equity market seems to be continuing to follow through on some of the upward movement that we saw earlier in the year that is related to global growth,” said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
Rising yields spooked the stock market last week, following employment data on Friday that caused concerns about inflationary pressures. 
However, this week has seen a rising stock market, despite yields remaining near their four-year-high.
Wednesday's move up in stocks - including a 1.3 percent surge for the S&P 500 (SPX) - came even as the benchmark 10-year Treasury's yield rose from 2.84 percent to 2.91 percent, following closely watched inflation data showing U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January. 
""The equity markets had to reprice for this (higher yield) environment, and now the stock market is saying: 'We're OK with this, Game On',"" said Jason Ware, Chief Investment Officer of Albion Financial in Utah, who said he still preferred stocks to bonds. 
""It's still a no brainer,"" Ware said. ""The total return for equities is so much more attractive than the meager income you get from bonds."" 
Wednesday's rise in stocks also came as volatility levels had fallen, with the Cboe Volatility index (VIX) dropping into the 20s after rising as high as 50 a week earlier, and coincided with expiring VIX futures and options. 
Rising bond yields threaten stocks because they present investment competition following years of very low rates that supported equities. Increasing rates also could indicate a tightening of economic conditions.
“I think the turnaround in the equity market was more associated with an improving economy and removing the focus on the yield environment,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
“The market switched its attention to, ‘OK, we have an expanding economy, it’s not running so hot that I have to be overly worried about interest rates.’”
Pavlik and McMillion favor sectors that should perform well during an improving economy, including financials and consumer discretionary stocks.
Since October, the S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury yields have been positively correlated, moving in the same direction, when viewed over a mid-term, 60-day period, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But the move higher came as bond yields were rising off of very low levels. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered on Thursday around 2.90 percent after touching a more-than four year high during the session.
“If the economy is accelerating then we should be able to handle higher bond yields and not derail the economy,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""If growth is accelerating and moving higher, then along the way we can handle higher levels.""
The biggest risk from rates is a fast move higher in yields that catches the market off guard, as opposed to breaching a specific level, Delwiche said.
But if the benchmark 10-year tops 3 percent, that could cause some fear for stock investors, said Brian Shepardson, portfolio manager for the James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, in Alpha, Ohio.

“If higher rates are what caused the market to pull back, that is still a concern,"" Shepardson said. ""Nothing has changed fundamentally within the market.”

611,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices rise in January; industrial output falls,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, boosted by strong gains in the cost of gasoline and healthcare, offering more evidence that inflation pressures were building up.
While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits, claims continued to point to a tightening labor market. Economists were also unfazed by an unexpected dip in industrial production last month, citing strong business sentiment surveys.
The relatively strong producer inflation report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a broad increase in consumer prices in January. Rising inflation was also corroborated by two regional manufacturing surveys on Thursday, which showed sharp increases in prices paid by factories for inputs.
""The drumbeat of higher inflation is getting louder,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It does appear as if higher inflation is here to stay.""
Firming inflation could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rate a bit more aggressively than is currently anticipated. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year, with the first hike expected in March.
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in December. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in December. 
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services jumped 0.4 percent last month. The so-called core PPI edged up 0.1 percent in December.
Core PPI rose 2.5 percent in the 12 months through January, the largest increase since August 2014. That followed a 2.3 percent gain in December.
The cost of hospital outpatient care surged 1.0 percent in January, the largest increase since August 2014, after gaining 0.1 percent in December. There was also an increase in the price of hospital inpatient care.
Overall, the cost of healthcare services shot up 0.7 percent in January. These costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target. Following the CPI and PPI reports,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is forecasting the core PCE price index rising 0.31 percent in January after increasing 0.2 percent in December. 
That would raise the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent in December. The data is scheduled for release on March 1.
The dollar fell to a 15-month low against the yen, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were mixed.
JOBLESS CLAIMS RISE 
Wholesale goods prices increased 0.7 percent last month, after nudging up 0.1 percent in December. Gasoline prices, which rose 7.1 percent, accounted for nearly half of the increase in the cost of goods last month. 
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Feb. 10. 
Claims fell to 216,000 in mid-January, which was the lowest level since January 1973. Last week marked the 154th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 228,500.
""The trend in the claims data continues to signal that conditions remain favorable in the labor market. There has been no week with initial claims filings above 231,000 since early in January,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Another report from the Fed showed industrial production fell 0.1 percent in January as output at factories failed to increase for the second straight month. Industrial production, which rose 0.4 percent in December, was also weighed down by a 1.0 percent drop in mining output.
""We have to remember that the early releases of industrial production are driven more by the hours worked data than physical product data and we may see the production data revised higher as more physical product data are received and incorporated into the estimates of production,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
A fourth report from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in February amid a surge in demand for manufactured goods. Manufacturers reported hiring more workers. 
They also reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey's measure of prices paid rising to its highest level since May 2011, which suggests further increases in producer prices.
While another report from the New York Fed showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity in New York state in February, factories reported strong order growth and were upbeat about business prospects over the next six months. 

The survey's measure of prices paid by factories for inputs rose to its highest level in nearly six years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders tumbled in December at the fastest pace in more than three years and companies expect orders to rise only marginally in January-March, raising concerns that recent gains in capital expenditure may taper off.
The 11.9 percent decline in December core orders, the largest fall since May 2014, was more than the median estimate of a 2.3 percent fall and followed a 5.7 percent increase in November.
The machinery orders come a day after gross domestic product data for October-December showed capital expenditure had risen for five consecutive quarters, although the last quarter's modest 0.7 percent undershot the median estimate for a 1.1 percent rise and now suggest this run of gains may not continue at the same pace.
Core machinery orders are regarded as an indicator of capital investment six to nine months ahead. 
Economists say Japan's economy can continue to grow thanks to the strength in consumer spending and exports, but they also note that consumer prices, not business investment, will ultimately determine whether the Bank of Japan's bold experiment to generate inflation succeeds.
""Capital expenditure will not accelerate, but at the same time I don't expect it to start falling,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Business investment can continue to grow gradually, because companies have ample profits. The economy is not stuttering.""
Companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, will rise only 0.6 percent in January-March after a 0.1 percent decrease in October-December. 
Orders from manufacturers tumbled 13.3 percent month-on-month in December, the largest decline since February 2016.
That followed a 0.2 percent decline in the previous month because of reduced orders from makers of metals and manufacturing equipment as well as makers of nuclear fuel. 
Non-manufacturers' orders fell 7.3 percent, following a 9.8 percent gain in November due to declines in orders from retailers and wholesalers.
For January-March, manufacturers expect their orders to fall 5.7 percent, while non-manufacturers expect their orders to rise 7.4 percent.
Investors will get another chance to measure the health of Japan's economy when Reuters releases its Tankan business sentiment survey on Feb. 19. Last month manufacturers' sentiment improved to the highest in 11 years.
""Looking ahead, firms are reporting the most severe capacity shortages since the early 1990s,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The upshot is that non-residential investment should continue to expand this year. We've penciled in a 2 percent rise.""
Since taking office in late 2012, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has used tax breaks and other incentives to encourage more domestic capital investment. 
Companies were slow to respond at first but in recent years several indicators have shown consistent gains in capital expenditure.

Some companies are also spending on technology to deal with chronic labor shortages caused by Japan's shrinking and rapidly ageing population.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 02:11PM ET</span>",Rise in U.S. inflation puts spotlight on Fed's Powell,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January as Americans paid more for gasoline, rental accommodation and healthcare, raising pressure on new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell to prevent a possible overheating of the economy.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, however, likely overstates the inflation picture given that some of the price gains, especially for apparel and motor vehicle insurance, are seen by economists as unsustainable.
Inflation, which could get a further boost from a tightening labor market and increased government spending, might force the Fed to be more aggressive in raising interest rates this year than currently anticipated. That would slow economic growth. 
The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes for this year, with the first increase expected at its next policy meeting in March. Powell took over the reins of the Fed from Janet Yellen earlier this month.
""While we have been looking for inflation to firm, we think last month's increase probably overstates the underlying trend,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""Today's inflation reading should probably cement in place the Fed's intent to hike rates at the March meeting. We now also think the odds are moving up that they also revise their guidance at that meeting from looking for three hikes this year to four, aligning with our view.""
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month as households paid more for gasoline, rental accommodation and healthcare. The CPI rose 0.2 percent in December. The year-on-year increase in the CPI was unchanged at 2.1 percent in January as the large price gains from last year dropped out of the calculation.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI shot up 0.3 percent. That was the largest increase since January 2017 and followed a 0.2 percent rise in December. The year-on-year rise in the so-called core CPI was unchanged at 1.8 percent in January. Economists had forecast the CPI increasing 0.3 percent in January and the core CPI rising 0.2 percent.
The core CPI is viewed as a better measure of underlying inflation trends. The Fed tracks a different index, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which has consistently undershot the central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012.
The dollar (DXY) initially rose against a basket of currencies after the data but later surrendered the gains. Stocks on Wall Street opened lower before erasing losses. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
U.S. financial markets have been on edge after being spooked by a surge in annual wage growth in January. 
INFLATION BUILDING UP 
So-called base effects will turn more favorable in March, which economists say would set the course for higher annual inflation readings. Average hourly earnings jumped 2.9 percent on an annual basis in January, the largest rise since June 2009, from 2.7 percent in December.
A pickup in wage growth as the labor market hits full employment is expected to contribute to higher inflation this year. Fiscal stimulus in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending are also expected to add to price pressures.
""The Fed's task is complicated by the recent tax cuts and spending deal, which will stimulate the economy at a time when the labor market is already at, or close to, full employment,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. 
A weakening dollar is also expected to put pressure on inflation. Rising inflation could hurt consumer spending, which is already showing signs of slowing. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed retail sales fell 0.3 percent in January, the largest decline since February 2017, after being unchanged in December.
""Bad January weather could have contributed to the weakness in retail sales as consumers avoided auto dealerships and put home building projects on hold,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The weak retail sales and stronger inflation prompted the Atlanta Fed to slash its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by 0.8 percentage point to a 3.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.   
Inflation last month was driven by gasoline prices, which rebounded 5.7 percent after falling 0.8 percent in December. Crude oil prices surged in January on strong global demand and a depreciating dollar. Food prices rose 0.2 percent in January.
The core CPI was boosted by rising rents. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in December. 
The cost of healthcare services increased 0.4 percent, with prices for hospital care jumping 1.3 percent and the cost of doctor visits rising 0.3 percent. Apparel prices surged 1.7 percent, the biggest increase since February 1990. 
There were also increases in the cost of motor vehicle insurance, which recorded its largest gain since November 2001. Prices of personal care products posted their biggest increase in three years. But consumers got some respite from airline fares, which fell for a third straight month in January.

Prices of new motor vehicles slipped last month and the costs of recreation, communication and alcohol were unchanged.

The report sent Treasuries and stocks tumbling, as it added to concerns about an inflation pickup that have roiled financial markets this month.
The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent from the previous month, above the median estimate of economists for a 0.3 percent increase, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core gauge increased 0.3 percent, also above forecasts for 0.2 percent. It was up 1.8 percent from a year earlier, higher than the 1.7 percent estimate.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose to 2.86 percent, while U.S. stock futures fell, as the figures renewed investor concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace than anticipated. The data followed wage figures earlier this month sent Treasury yields spiking and started a rout in equities that pushed them into the first correction in two years.
“Some of laws of normal economic nature seem to be reasserting themselves,” Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income and a former Fed and Treasury official, said on Bloomberg Television.
While Sheets said he wouldn’t raise his outlook for the path of inflation, the report “gives me increased confidence that we are in a place where inflation is likely to be gradually rising more or less in line with the Federal Reserve’s forecast and consistent with an economy where we are seeing diminished slack, strengthening labor markets, solid growth.”
The 1.7 percent monthly gain in apparel prices, which account for about 3 percent of the CPI, was the biggest since 1990. Women’s apparel costs jumped a record 3.4 percent, the report showed.
Other items contributing to the gain in CPI included rents and owners’ equivalent rent, which both rose 0.3 percent from December; medical care, up 0.4 percent; and motor vehicle insurance, which advanced 1.3 percent, the most since 2001.
The increase in the core CPI brought the three-month annualized gain to 2.9 percent, the fastest since 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Retail Sales
A separate report showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in January and December figures were revised downward, suggesting consumer spending is on a slower track in the first quarter.
Including all items, the main CPI gauge rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the same pace as in December and exceeding forecasts for a 1.9 percent increase.
The report follows the Labor Department’s annual revisions to CPI last week that took the December monthly increase in the core index down to 0.2 percent, from an initially reported 0.3 percent. The December gain in the main index was revised upward to 0.2 percent from 0.1 percent.
Policy makers look at the core index to better gauge underlying inflation because food and energy prices tend to be volatile. The latest report showed energy prices rose 3 percent from the previous month and food costs advanced 0.2 percent.
The two main U.S. stock indexes endured wild swings last week on concerns that inflation would spur higher interest rates more quickly, boosting borrowing costs for companies. Even so, equities have recovered some ground, advancing for three trading sessions in a row through Tuesday.
Fed Outlook
While economists and investors have seen a Fed interest-rate hike in March as a near-certainty, the details of the latest CPI report could play a role in the timing and number of rate increases throughout 2018.
The central bank’s preferred gauge of inflation -- a separate figure based on consumer purchases and issued by the Commerce Department -- has mostly missed its 2 percent goal in the past five years. The measure excluding food and energy is also below the Fed’s target. January data are due for release on March 1.
Fed policy makers will also have February CPI data in hand before they next meet March 20-21 in Jerome Powell’s first gathering as chairman. Powell, speaking Tuesday at his ceremonial swearing-in, suggested that the central bank would push ahead with gradual interest-rate increases, and that officials “remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability.”
Retail sales fell 0.3 percent in January from the previous month, the most since February 2017, according to the Commerce Department, compared with the median estimate of economists for a 0.2 percent increase. December’s figures were revised to show little change, after an initially reported gain of 0.4 percent.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production jumped more than expected in December, data from the EU statistics office Eurostat showed on Wednesday, underlining the fastest economic growth rate in a decade that economists expect to continue in 2018.
Eurostat said industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent month-on-month for a 5.2 percent year-on-year gain. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2 percent monthly and 4.2 percent annual rise.
""The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy,"" said Bert Colijn, senior euro zone economist at ING bank.
""Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018,"" he said.
The statistics office also confirmed its earlier preliminary estimate of gross domestic product growth in the euro zone in the last three months of 2017 at 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and 2.7 percent against the same period of 2016.
Overall in 2017, euro zone GDP rose 2.5 percent, Eurostat said, the fastest growth rate since a 3.0 percent rise in 2007.
""Looking ahead, surveys suggest that the region’s upturn will gather pace,"" said Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect the euro zone’s upturn to match last year’s strong pace in 2018, with annual GDP growth of 2.5 percent.""
UPSWING SEEN CONTINUING
The GDP of Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, grew 0.6 percent on the quarter and 2.9 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, with France at 0.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively and Spain at 0.7 and 3.1 percent respectively.
""For the year 2018 as a whole, a strong increase of 2.5 percent is still likely, even if the statisticians have slightly revised previous data downwards,"" Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said in a note on Germany. 
""We continue to believe that the upswing could continue for another two or three years despite the roll-back of labor market reforms because cyclical tensions on the labor market are not yet in sight,"" he said.
Eurostat also revised upwards November production figures to 1.3 percent month-on-month from 1.0 percent and to 3.7 percent year-on-year from 3.2 percent.
The production surge was fueled by durable consumer goods such as refrigerators and TV sets, the output of which jumped 2.7 percent on the month in December and was 7.4 percent higher than a year earlier. 
The output of intermediate goods -- like parts for their production -- jumped 1.4 percent for a 6.6 percent annual gain.

The production of capital goods rose 7.6 percent year-on-year in December, accelerating from 6.7 percent in the previous month, indicating that investment was picking up too.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 03:22AM ET</span>","Exports drive solid German growth, inflation subdued","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong exports drove robust growth in Germany at the end of last year while inflation stayed subdued in January, suggesting Europe's biggest economy is on track to extend its upswing well into 2018.
Growth was 0.6 percent on the quarter between October and December, according to Wednesday's Federal Statistics Office data - in line with the consensus forecast and a slight slowdown from a downwardly revised 0.7 percent in the third quarter.
""The German growth turbo remains fully activated,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger said, though production bottlenecks and capacity constraints were likely to dampen any future growth.
The office said positive contributions in the fourth quarter came mainly from foreign demand. ""According to provisional calculations, exports increased substantially,"" it said.
Government consumption expenditure increased while household spending was little changed, the office said. It will release more detailed results on Feb. 23.
On the year, Europe's biggest economy expanded a calendar-adjusted 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, the data showed. This was weaker than the consensus forecast of 3.0 percent but still the strongest pace of growth since the second quarter of 2011.
The office confirmed an earlier estimate for full-year GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2017 which translated into a calendar-adjusted rate of 2.5 percent. This was the strongest pace since 2011.
ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the economy grew in 33 of the last 36 quarters, at an ""impressive"" average rate of 0.5 percent on the quarter.
""Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating,"" he said.
Separate data from the Statistics Office showed that inflation remained subdued despite the solid upswing.
Consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries, fell by 1.0 percent in January from the previous month and rose by 1.4 percent from the previous year.
On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation for January was also confirmed. The national index fell 0.7 from December and rose by 1.6 percent on the previous year.

The weak German inflation data is lending support to the European Central Bank's cautious approach to reducing its unprecedented monetary stimulus.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 01:59AM ET</span>",Japan posts longest growth streak since 1980s bubble economy,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy posted its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s boom as fourth quarter growth was boosted by consumer spending, moving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's revival plan a step closer to vanquishing decades of stagnation. 
The long run of growth is an encouraging sign for the Bank of Japan, hinting that the economy may at last be building up momentum to lift consumer prices toward its 2 percent inflation target.
The economy expanded at a 0.5 percent annualized rate in October-December, less than the median estimate for annualized growth of 0.9 percent, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday. That followed a revised 2.2 percent annualized increase in July-September.
Japan's economy grew a real 1.6 percent in calendar 2017, the fastest increase since a 2.0 percent expansion in 2013. 
An extended run of growth could lead to some speculation that the Bank of Japan can afford to scale back quantitative easing, but economists say it is unlikely as long as the yen is rising and Japan's consumer prices remain subdued.
Financial markets are already on edge from worries that central banks in the United States and Europe will raise interest rates faster than expected to stay ahead of inflation, but the BOJ is expected to lag well behind those peers.
""Economic fundamentals look good and growth this year is likely to be above the economy's potential,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""However, I don't see any talk of an exit for the BOJ when the yen is rising like this. When financial markets are volatile this hurts Japan's animal spirits,"" he said, referring to investor and consumer confidence.
The dollar slid to a 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday, as investors remained on edge ahead of U.S. inflation numbers later in the day, underscoring fragile sentiment following a recent shakeout in global equity markets.
A rising yen, which tends to push down Japan's import prices and depress exporters' earnings, took the gloss off an otherwise respectable report on the world's third-largest economy.
The GDP data comes after news that Abe's government has decided to nominate Haruhiko Kuroda for a rare second term as Bank of Japan governor, a sign his ultra-loose monetary policy will remain in place, although investors still have questions about who the deputy governors will be and what policies they are likely to favor.
Japan's economy has now posted the longest continuous expansion since a 12-quarter stretch of growth between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989 around the height of Japan's notorious economic bubble.
""The headline figures are somewhat weaker than expected, but that's not something to worry too much about,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Capital expenditure and consumption are picking up. Exports are also strong. Other recent data are also strong. It's safe to say the economy is in pretty good shape.""
Compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.1 percent, slightly less than the median estimate of 0.2 percent growth and following a 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter expansion in July-September, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
A Cabinet Office official said increased spending on mobile phones, cars, and dining out drove gains in private consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP.
To be sure, some economists are cautious about domestic demand because any further declines in global stocks could hurt sentiment and returns on investors' portfolios.
Real wages fell 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, the first decline in three quarters, which is another risk to domestic demand, although the tightest labor market in about 40 years may give unions more bargaining power in impending wage talks. 
""I'm a little worried about sluggish wage growth,"" said Daiju Aoki, regional chief investment officer at UBS Securities.
""I'm also worried about a negative wealth effect from a falling stock market.""
Capital expenditure rose 0.7 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, less than the median estimate for a 1.1 percent increase but up for the fifth straight quarter and a sign of sustainable gains in business investment.
Overseas demand subtracted fractionally from GDP in October-December. Exports rose 2.4 percent, but this gain was offset by a 2.9 percent jump in imports thanks to robust domestic demand.
Since taking office in late 2012, Abe has enacted reforms to draw more women and elderly people into the workforce, raise wages for part-time workers, liberalize the labor market, and encourage business investment.
""Domestic demand is strong enough that it can stand on its own two feet, so you can say Abenomics has matured,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.

""Financial market moves pose risks, but I still expect consumption and business investment to drive future growth.""

629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>","Japan’s Economy Loses Speed, Misses Forecasts in 4th Quarter","(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy expanded for an eighth quarter, but the pace of growth fell sharply and missed expectations. Slower growth ahead, particularly with a stronger yen, weakens inflationary pressure and underscores the likelihood of continued stimulus from the central bank.
Key Takeaways
Japan’s economy had cruised along at well above its potential growth rate in recent quarters, fueling growing confidence that an ever-tighter labor market and record corporate profits would generate stronger consumer spending and inflation. While private consumption and business investment have improved, wage gains remain sluggish and inflation is still well below target. Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the run of growth is the longest in 28 years and is the beginning of a positive economic cycle.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly held close to its highest level in nearly six years in January, highlighting the challenge facing the Bank of England and reinforcing expectations of a rise in interest rates in May.
Consumer price inflation held at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in January, unchanged from December, after hitting its highest since March 2012 in November at 3.1 percent, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Sterling rose after Tuesday's data and was up by 0.5 percent against the dollar at 1035 GMT. British government bond prices fell in contrast to a rise in the price of German bunds.
Inflation jumped in Britain after the June 2016 decision by voters to leave the European Union, which hammered the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of imports. 
By contrast, many other countries are facing below-target inflation despite strong economic growth.
The BoE surprised investors last week by saying interest rates would need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than it had previously expected, as it wanted to get inflation back to target within two years rather than three. 
Markets priced in as much as a 70 percent chance of a quarter-point rise in interest rates by May, and a roughly 50 percent chance of a further increase in rates to one percent by the end of the year - a level last seen in 2009.
Economist Lucy O'Carroll of Aberdeen Standard Investments said inflation appeared to have peaked as the impact of the pound's fall after the Brexit vote began to fade.
Nonetheless, signs of a pick-up in wages suggested that price growth might be slower to fall than the BoE hoped.
""Even if inflation drops back a bit further from here, it looks likely to settle at a higher level than the Bank of England feels comfortable with. It will also mean slightly higher interest rates than we've been used to,"" she said.
Tuesday's CPI data showed downward pressure on inflation from a lesser increase in fuel prices than a year ago. But the ONS highlighted a smaller than usual seasonal decline in the cost of visiting zoos and gardens as pushing up on price growth.
Core consumer price inflation - which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco - rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent, and services price inflation, which is more sensitive to wage costs, also accelerated.
BoE policymakers have pointed to rising wages as a possible reason to increase rates, although headline data still shows average growth in weekly earnings well below the rate of inflation, squeezing on living standards.
The ONS figures suggested less pressure in the pipeline for food and manufactured goods.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 4.7 percent higher than in January 2016, the smallest increase since July 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had expected input prices to rise by 4.2 percent. 

Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 2.8 percent less than the consensus forecast of 3.0 percent and the smallest increase since November 2016.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics said that the annual rate of change in the consumer price index rose to 3.0% in January, the same as the prior month. Economists had expected a reading of 2.9%.
Inflation fell by a negative 0.5% month-over-month in Janurary, compared to expectations of a fall of 0.6%. Last month inflation rose by 0.4%.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, rose to 2.7%, compared to 2.5% the month prior. Analysts had expected a reading of 2.6%.
Meanwhile the retail price index (RPI) increased by an annualized 4.0% in January compared to 4.1% in December and below expectations of an increase of 4.1%. The RPI fell by a negative 0.8% on a monthly basis compared to an increase of 0.8% in December. Economists had expected the index to fall by a negative 0.7%.
The core RPI rose by an annualized 4.0% compared to 4.2% the month before. Month-on-month, the core RPI fell to 0.8%, compared to a rise of 0.8% the month prior.
The data also showed that the house price index rose by 5.2% in January, compared to 5.0% the month prior, which was revised down from 5.1%.
The ONS said in a report that the downward pressure came from changes in the price of motor fuels, which rose by less than a year ago. However, a fall in recreational goods and services lead to an inflation increase, they added.
""The main upward effect came from prices for a range of recreational and cultural goods and services, in particular, admissions to attractions such as zoos and gardens, for which prices fell by less than they did a year ago."""

636,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","China January new loans surge to record 2.9 trillion yuan, blow past forecasts","By Kevin Yao and Fang Cheng
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banks extended a record 2.9 trillion yuan ($458.3 billion) in new yuan loans in January, blowing past expectations and nearly five times the previous month as policymakers aim to sustain solid economic growth while reining in debt risks.
While Chinese banks tend to front-load loans early in the year to get higher-quality customers and win market share, the lofty figure was even higher than the most bullish forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Net new loans surpassed the previous record of 2.51 trillion yuan in January 2016, which is likely to support growth not only in China but may underpin liquidity globally as major Western central banks begin to withdraw stimulus.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 2 trillion yuan, up sharply from December's 584.4 billion yuan.
A more detailed breakdown of the loan data on Monday showed sharp pickups in demand for credit from both households and companies, auguring well for consumption and investment.
""Banks hope to lend early to get early returns... private investment and manufacturing investment are picking up due to firmer global demand (and) household loans could be boosted by property demand,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
""This indicates the economy may slow in the first half but any slowdown won't be sharp...""
Corporate loans surged to 1.78 trillion yuan from 243.2 billion yuan in December, while household loans rose to 901.6 billion yuan in January from 329.4 billion yuan in December, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank data.
Beijing is in the second year of a regulatory push to clamp down on riskier financial activity that has been fueled by a rapid build-up in debt.
But authorities are proceeding cautiously and keeping liquidity broadly supportive to avoid any sharp drag on the world's second-largest economy or excessive financial market volatility.
Broad M2 money supply also beat expectations, growing 8.6 percent in January from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Monday. Economists had expected the growth rate to edge up to 8.4 percent from 8.2 percent in December.
Other data last week had painted a somewhat mixed picture of the economy at the start of the year, with inflationary pressures easing -- possibly pointing to softening activity -- but better-than-expected import and export growth.
Taken together, the stronger credit and trade data would appear to still support the consensus view that China will see only a modest pullback in GDP growth to around 6.5 percent this year, after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017.
CREDIT STILL AMPLE
Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2 percent in January from a year earlier, also faster than an expected 12.5 percent rise and compared with an increase of 12.7 percent in December.
Last year China's total new loans hit a record 13.53 trillion yuan, 7 percent more than the previous record in 2016.
The credit boom has been fueled by strong economic growth, a robust property market and a crackdown on riskier shadow lending, which has forced banks to shift some loans back onto their balance sheets.
Since the start of 2017, Chinese regulators have announced a slew of steps to coax financial institutions to reduce riskier activity and leverage, targeting everything from interbank lending levels to bond trading, negotiable certificates of deposit and entrusted loans.
In addition, the PBOC has been gingerly nudging up money market interest rates, most recently in December, but rates have also been slowly creeping higher on their own as regulators look set to persist with the current ""de-risking"" campaign much longer than policy crackdowns in the past.
Those efforts appear to be bearing fruit. The outstanding amount of banking wealth management products (WMPs) grew just 1.7 percent last year, compared with a near 24 percent rise in 2016. Many of these products had strong links with the less-regulated shadow banking sector. 
Analysts expect authorities to step up their efforts this year, focusing on local government debt, rising corporate and household debt levels and dealing with ""zombie"" companies.
On Monday, the state planner issued new rules for companies which are planning to issue bonds to put more pressure on debt-laden local governments to get their finances in order.
But analysts say more still needs to be done on structural reforms to rein in ballooning corporate debt, which has reached levels that the IMF and others have warned sharply raises the risks of a financial crisis.
China's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, surged to 3.06 trillion yuan in January from 1.14 trillion yuan in December, additional data showed on Monday.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
That can provide hints on activity in China's vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Global trade in goods will continue growing above trend during the second quarter, the World Trade Organization's quarterly outlook indicator showed on Monday. 
The indicator, a composite published since the third quarter of 2016, showed a reading of 102.3, compared to 102.2 last November. 
All the indicator's seven components were positive except for trade in electronic components, which fell to 94.1 from 103.3 in the previous quarter, possibly indicating a weakening of consumer sentiment, the WTO said in a statement.
“Growth is still above trend,"" WTO economist Coleman Nee told Reuters. 
""The recovery of 2017 seems to be extending into the first quarter of 2018 at least, based on things like strong export orders, strong air freight and container shipping and other indicators. So it seems like there hasn’t been any slackening of momentum.”
The strongest component of the index was container port throughput at 104.3, its highest score since the WTO began publishing the indicator. 
The WTO has forecast overall growth in world goods trade in a range of 1.4 percent to 4.4 percent this year, most likely around 3.2 percent, compared to an estimated 3.6 percent in 2017.
Those figures, published last September, were based on IMF economic growth projections that have since been upgraded by 0.2 percentage points, to 3.2 percent in 2017 and 3.3 percent in 2018. The WTO will update its 2018 trade forecast in April.
Trade disputes and international trade friction do not much affect the overall global trade picture, Nee said, since they tend to affect a particular sector in a particular country, and if one source of goods is restricted, importers often simply switch to alternative sources for the same goods.
A very wide-ranging dispute or a tit-for-tat battle could still create uncertainty and sap economic growth, but that would be visible in a GDP slowdown rather than directly in trade statistics.

“Trade friction between countries can throw sand in the gears of the global economy,” Nee said.

Visa, whose debit and credit cards are used for a third of payments in Britain, said on Monday that consumers stayed away from the traditional post-Christmas sales last month.
Household spending fell by 1.2 percent in January compared with the same month in 2017, with spending in shops down by 4 percent, it said.
""Consumer spending entered the new year on a downbeat note, falling for the eighth time in the past nine months, as Britons continued to cut back on spending,"" Visa's chief commercial officer, Mark Antipof, said.
A fall in car sales weighed on the overall sales figures too. But there was better news for hotels and restaurants - as well as for hair salons and sellers of beauty products, as consumers looked for small treats for themselves.
Britain's economy lagged behind stronger growth in other rich nations in 2017 as higher inflation since the Brexit vote and slow wage growth pinched consumers' spending power.
Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data firm IHS Markit which produces the survey for Visa, said concerns about Brexit were weighing on consumer confidence. But spending could pick up later this year as inflation is expected to fall back while wages rise more quickly, she added. 

Visa's data is based on card spending, adjusted for inflation, the number of cards in circulation and a long-term fall in the use of cash.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent after a revised 0.6 percent rise in November. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories rose 0.2 percent in December.
Auto inventories rose 1.7 percent after increasing 0.9 percent in November.

640,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 08:35AM ET</span>",Oil pipeline shutdown hits UK industry but manufacturing and construction grow,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British industry suffered its biggest fall since 2012 in December due to the temporary shutdown of a major oil pipeline, but growth in manufacturing confirmed the broader picture of solid economic expansion at the end of 2017.
Construction also showed a surprise surge in December, according to official data published on Friday.
Britain's economic growth slowed slightly in 2017 as higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit vote hurt consumers, but some exporters have gained from the weaker pound and the stronger global economy.
Industrial output fell by 1.3 percent month-on-month in December, the biggest drop since September 2012 after a 0.3 percent rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected to see output fall 0.9 percent as a shutdown in the damaged Forties North Sea oil pipeline looked certain drag on the sector.
While Friday's figures showed the hit was bigger than thought, the pipeline is back online so a rebound in production looks likely in January.
Overall, the data are unlikely to alter the analysis of Bank of England officials who on Thursday upgraded their growth forecasts for Britain on account of an improving global economy, and said interest rates were likely to need to rise sooner than it had thought last year.
Sterling and British government bonds showed little reaction to the data, but the pound later hit a three-week low against the U.S. dollar after the European Union's Brexit negotiator warned Britain that a transition period was ""not a given"".
The ONS said Britain's manufacturing sector, which is part of overall industrial output, saw output rise by 0.3 percent on the month, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth in the sector - the longest such run in nearly 30 years.
""Taken as a whole, we believe that today's release remains consistent with the Bank of England gradually tightening monetary policy over the next two years,"" said Investec economist George Brown.
Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.5 percent in the three months to December, the fastest pace seen over 2017. The ONS said the industrial and construction data did not alter this estimate.
The economy continued to expand at this pace in the three months to January, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated on Friday.
The buoyant world economy has been a boon for British exporters, who are in the midst of a sweet spot before Britain's exit from the European Union, BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday.
Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday that he would not be shocked if British interest rates needed to go up twice this year.
However, ONS data showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 13.6 billion pounds ($18.8 billion) in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller shortfall of 11.6 billion pounds.
The ONS linked the large deficit to rising crude oil prices and higher imports.
For 2017 as a whole, the total trade deficit including services narrowed by 7 billion pounds to 33.6 billion pounds.
British trade minister Liam Fox said the figures showed demand for British goods and services was higher than ever.
Separately, the ONS said construction output jumped 1.6 percent on the month, helped by an upturn in infrastructure projects. The Reuters poll suggested construction output would be flat.

A moderation in Chinese inflation would support the view that the world's second-largest economy is slowly starting to lose momentum after forecast-beating growth of 6.9 percent in 2017.
But data from China early in the year must always be treated with caution due to business and price distortions caused by the timing of the long Lunar New Year celebrations, which fell in late January 2017 but start in mid-February this year. 
China's producer inflation eased for a third straight month in January and by slightly more than expected, official data showed on Friday, suggesting last year's strong profit growth in its industrial sector may start to fade.
Lower revenues could impair Chinese firms' ability to service a mountain of debt as Beijing works to reduce risks in the financial system.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 4.3 percent in January from a year earlier, the smallest rise in 14 months and compared with 4.9 percent in December.
Analysts had expected a reading of 4.4 percent, citing milder price rises for raw materials and finished goods like steel.
On a monthly basis, the PPI rose 0.3 percent in January, less than half the pace seen in the previous month.
CONSUMER INFLATION ALSO MILD
China's consumer inflation also eased to the lowest since July 2017.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, in line with expectations and slowing from December's gain of 1.8 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose 0.6 percent in January. 
The food price index declined 0.5 percent from a year earlier due to a higher base last year, after falling 0.4 percent in December. Non-food prices rose 2.0 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in December.
The milder inflation readings are somewhat at odds with strong import and export data on Thursday, which suggested China's economy largely retained its momentum or possibly even picked up a step at the start of the year.
But analysts said the softer January price data by itself did not suggest the economy is at risk of a sharper slowdown, as it can be too skewed by seasonal factors. Indeed, the consensus view is that China will see only a modest pullback in GDP growth to 6.4 percent this year.
""It's really a mathematical game due to the base effect,"" said Tommy Xie, a Singapore-based economist at OCBC bank, adding that January could be the last month that CPI was below 2 percent this year.
""In terms of the economic growth, I think the latest trade data actually points to extended growth momentum.""
While last year's higher producer prices are expected to percolate down to the consumer level eventually, sources have told Reuters that China's government will maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2018.
That suggests policymakers are not foreseeing any sharp retail price rises that could force the central bank to change course and tighten policy more quickly.

Global stock markets began to tumble last Friday after a healthy U.S. labor market report sparked fears of rising inflation which could trigger more central bank rate hikes.

Big Picture
Continued moderation in China’s factory inflation may signal waning support from the world’s second largest economy for the global reflation trend, as concerns over price gains elsewhere contribute to market turbulence. Domestically, while modest consumer price inflation helps maintain spending power, slowing PPI crimps industrial profits and complicates the nation’s effort to pay down corporate debt.

Economist Takeaways
""China’s PPI will be relatively stable this year. It will neither fall sharply, as the economy’s growth momentum still extends, nor will it surge a lot as the high base last year reduces that possibility,"" said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. ""Therefore, China’s PPI won’t be a drag on global reflation, and it also won’t be the focus. The focus would be on the wage growth in the U.S. and Europe. China’s PPI exporting inflation pressure is more a story of last year.""
""The moderation in PPI is mild and was mostly a result of high-base effects, so I think the stable factory inflation suggests China’s economy is steady and that’s good news for the global economic recovery,"" said Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International in Hong Kong. ""The PPI will remain around 3 to 4 percent in the coming two months due to the high-base factor, and will climb in April and May on rising commodity prices.""
""PPI will face slight downward pressure this year,"" weighing more on the upstream sectors than downstream sectors, said Iris Pang, an economist at ING Group NV in Hong Kong. ""Chances are small for China to export inflationary pressures in the future as China will need to import, not export, after cutting excessive capacity,"" she said, adding that January’s trade data shows China has kept buying raw materials despite resurgent prices.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims drop to near 45-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, dropping to its lowest level in nearly 45 years as the labor market tightened further, bolstering expectations of faster wage growth this year.
The second straight weekly decline in claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday also pointed to strong job growth momentum, which could further drive the unemployment rate lower. 
""The extremely low level of claims is a sign of tightness in the labor market and suggests that February is shaping up to be another solid month for job creation,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended Feb. 3, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 216,000 in mid-January, which was the lowest level since January 1973. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 232,000 in the latest week. Last week marked the 153rd straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The tighter labor market is starting to exert upward pressure on wage growth. 
The Labor Department reported last week that average hourly earnings jumped 2.9 percent year-on-year in January, the largest gain since June 2009, after advancing 2.7 percent in December. Employers added 200,000 jobs to their payrolls last month.
Strong wage growth supports optimism among Federal Reserve officials that inflation will increase toward the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target this year. U.S. financial markets expect the Fed will raise interest rates in March. 
The Fed has forecast three rate increases for this year after lifting borrowing costs three times in 2017.
ECONOMY LIKELY OVERHEATING
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to a near four-year high also as the Bank of England said interest rates probably need to rise sooner. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
""For Fed officials it is damn the torpedoes and plunging stock prices and keep with the game plan to raise rates gradually as the economy is showing increasing signs of overheating,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at 
MUFG in New York. ""The Fed may be out of step with current economic conditions and behind the curve.""
Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, declined 10,000 to 224,500, the lowest level since March 1973.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 33,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended Jan. 27. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 12,500 to 1.95 million.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>",Bank of England raises prospect of higher rates as global economy booms,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday interest rates probably need to rise sooner and by a bit more than it thought only three months ago, because Britain's slow-moving economy is getting a boost from the global recovery.
The BoE's rate-setters are giving themselves time to assess how Britain is coping with its impending departure from the European Union as they voted 9-0 to hold Bank Rate at 0.5 percent, in line with a Reuters poll of economists.
But Governor Mark Carney and colleagues saw a growing need to move faster on raising rates to keep a grip on inflation in the world's sixth-biggest economy, echoing other leading central banks which are moving toward tighter monetary policy, a decade on from the financial crisis.
The BoE said it now wanted to return inflation to its 2 percent target over ""a more conventional horizon"", which would mean curbing price growth within two years rather than three.
""Were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report,"" the Monetary Policy Committee said.
Sterling jumped by more than a cent against the U.S. dollar , reversing some of its recent declines, while British government bond prices fell and the BoE-sensitive two-year yield (GB2YT=RR) rose to its highest since late 2015.
Rate futures showed investors saw a nearly 70 percent chance of a rate hike in May  - up from under 50 percent before Thursday's meeting - with a rise fully priced in for August.
""It is no surprise to see interest rates being kept on hold this month. But it is still likely that we will see at least one quarter point rise in 2018 and possibly two or three,"" said Andrew Sentance, a former BoE rate-setter and senior economic adviser to accountants PwC.
Britain's economy slowed after the 2016 Brexit vote but has fared better than many investors expected at the time of the referendum, thanks largely to the much stronger global rebound in the United States, Germany and other key trading partners.
Although inflation has been running well above its 2 percent target, the BoE has raised rates only once so far since the 2007-09 financial crisis - in November - while the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised them five times.
BREXIT FACTOR
Jeremy Cook, an economist at currency brokers WorldFirst, said the BoE's plans to raise rates faster could go awry if this year's negotiations between Brussels and London over Brexit turn sour.
""This is optimistic stuff albeit underlined by the fairly monstrous caveat that the Brexit that the UK government is able to deliver is a smooth one,"" Cook said.
Carney said the BoE was watching to see if Prime Minister Theresa May can clinch a transition deal next month to secure full access for Britain to EU markets for about two years after it leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The BoE still expected the overall Brexit process to go smoothly, he said, before adding: ""But we'll learn.""
The BoE nudged up its economic growth forecasts for Britain to show an average annual expansion of 1.75 percent over the next three years.
That was a lot weaker than its expectation of global growth of nearly 4 percent over the same period and was also below the country's pre-financial crisis average of about 2.9 percent.
The BoE linked the sluggish British outlook to slower growth in the labor force, as fewer immigrants come to Britain after Brexit, and to the country's aging population.
But even with slower growth, Britain remained susceptible to excessive inflation. The BoE said it expected the economy could only grow by 1.5 percent a year before it risked overheating.
Annual wage growth is expected to pick up to 3 percent by the end of 2018, in line with previous forecasts. The BoE has often been too optimistic about wages.

The BoE lowered most of its inflation projections after sterling rose recently and bond yields in financial markets jumped. But inflation was expected to remain above the 2 percent target at 2.11 percent in three years' time.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 04:24AM ET</span>","Philippine central bank holds rate steady, says inflation spike will moderate","By Enrico Dela Cruz and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' central bank held interest rates steady on Thursday and poured cold water on expectations that it will hike this year, insisting that a sharp spike in inflation will prove temporary and price pressures will ease next year.
The policy-making Monetary Board voted to keep the overnight borrowing rate steady  at 3.0 percent, as well the rates on its lending and deposit facilities. It also left reserve requirement ratio for banks unchanged. 
""While latest baseline forecasts show higher inflation outturns for 2018, the inflation path is expected to moderate and settle within the inflation target range in 2019,"" a statement from Governor Nestor Espenilla said.
Citing price pressures from higher taxes, rising food and fuel prices, the central bank raised its forecast for average inflation this year to 4.34 percent - above its 2-4 percent target for 2018 and 2019 - from 3.4 percent. 
But it expects inflation to return to its comfort range next year, with the average print seen at 3.49 percent, albeit faster than its previous forecast of 3.2 percent. 
Economists were caught by surprise after annual inflation in January quickened to a more than three-year high of 4.0 percent, prompting some of them to bring forward their rate hike expectations to March.
Nine of 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted no change in rates on Thursday. The rest projected a hike.
STANDING READY
The central bank remains watchful against signs of second-round effects and inflation becoming broader-based, Espenilla said, adding that policymakers ""stand ready to take appropriate measures"" as needed to keep prices stable. 
Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics in London, said he was sticking to his view that interest rates would remain unchanged throughout 2018.
The Philippines last year held its spot as one of the fastest-expanding economies in Asia, posting 6.7 percent growth and sustaining expectations the central bank could tighten monetary policy this year.
After many years of current account surpluses, the Philippines now faces deficits, and that is a source of concern to some economists.
But the central bank governor told Reuters on Thursday that the Philippines' external position is underpinned by strong remittances, exports and outsourcing contracts.

He said the current account deficit reflects the Philippines' solid economic expansion, which has driven higher imports of capital goods, raw materials, and other commodity items.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>",Germany's trade surplus shrinks for the first time since 2009,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's trade surplus last year fell for the first time since 2009, data showed on Thursday, in a further sign that vibrant domestic demand is sucking in more imports and slowly re-balancing the country's export-oriented economy.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has come in for criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration for Berlin's large trade surplus with the United States, while scepticism towards free trade is mounting in some poorer euro zone countries.
International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has also urged Germany to increase domestic spending and boost imports, warning that the build-up of large current account surpluses in countries such as Germany is partly responsible for the rise of protectionism elsewhere.
""The improvement of the trade balance is driven by imports and not by exports,"" Dekabank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said. ""This means we don't have to put on the brakes on exports. This is a win-win-situation.""
In 2017, Germany's trade surplus went down to 244.9 billion euros ($300.86 billion) from its record-high of 248.9 billion euros reached in the previous year, according to data from the Federal Statistics Office. It was the first decline since 2009.
The wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, edged down to 257.1 billion euros from 259.3 billion euros in the previous year.
""This will please U.S. President Donald Trump for whom the German export surplus has always been a thorn in his side,"" Christiane von Berg from BayernLB said.
In December alone, seasonally adjusted exports rose by 0.3 percent on the month while imports rose by 1.4 percent, the data from the statistics office showed.
The exports figure beat expectations for a 1.0 percent fall while imports also came in stronger than the forecast for a 0.5 percent decrease.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus in December narrowed to 21.4 billion euros. This was smaller than the Reuters consensus forecast for a surplus of 21.7 billion euros.
""The strong euro is hardly leaving a mark. Due to dynamic global trade, the euro appreciation is not posing an acute problem,"" Scheuerle said.
The German government expects the consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest economy to continue this year, forecasting 2.4 percent growth for 2018 after 2.2 percent in the previous year.
To secure a fourth term as chancellor, Merkel on Wednesday handed her Social Democrat coalition partners control of the finance ministry, giving them license to spend a record budget surplus, and embracing their demands for European reform.
The agreed hike in additional state spending is likely to boost domestic demand even further and help to reduce the still large trade surplus also in the coming years.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade machine kicked up a gear in January after stumbling the previous month, with exports and imports both growing much more than expected, pointing to a strong start to the year for global demand.
Thursday's robust data, along with last week's strong manufacturing and service surveys, suggest China's economy remained resilient at the start of 2018 and may even have picked up some momentum, despite crackdowns on factory pollution and riskier financing that are driving up borrowing costs.
Exports in January rose 11.1 percent from a year earlier, picking up from a 10.9 percent gain in December, official data showed. Analysts had expected growth to cool for a second straight month to 9.6 percent. 
Imports surged 36.9 percent, the General Administration of Customs said, the fastest pace since last February and smashing analysts' forecast of 9.8 percent growth.
China's import growth had sharply decelerated to 4.5 percent in December, raising fears that its domestic demand was slumping as Beijing forced northern smelters and mills to curtail production to reduce thick winter smog.
Commodities again led the way in January, with China's crude oil imports hitting a record and iron ore imports at the second highest on record.
The figures left the country with its smallest trade surplus in 11 months at $20.34 billion, compared with December's $54.69 billion and forecasts for a $54.1 billion surplus in January.
However, data from China in the first two months of the year must always be treated with caution due to business distortions caused by the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in late January 2017 but start in mid-February this year.
Some of the jump in imports may have been due to inventory building ahead of the holidays rather than a pick-up in consumption, though economists said the data was still positive. 
""January trade data may be affected by the always changing timing of the Chinese New Year holiday...(but) such strong import data indicates that domestic demand momentum remains healthy going into 2018,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note. 
Kuijs expects China's import growth to slow in coming months due to unfavorable comparisons with high levels last year and an expected slowdown in overall economic activity. 
China's imports surged nearly 16 percent last year, the best since 2011, as a construction boom added to its insatiable demand for raw materials.
TRADE WAR?
China benefited from a global trade boom in 2017, which helped its exports grow at the fastest pace since 2013. The unexpected strength was also one of the key drivers behind the economy's forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion last year.
However, while global demand is tipped for another strong year, expectations of growing trade disputes with the United States could weigh on China's shipments in 2018.
The latest trade data showed China's goods surplus with the United States, a sore spot in relations between the two nations, narrowed last month, but that is unlikely to appease Washington. 
China's trade surplus with the U.S. was $21.895 billion in January, a customs spokesperson told Reuters, down from $25.55 billion in December.
But its 2017 surplus with the United States was $275.81 billion, topping the previous record in 2015 of $260.8 billion.
President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels last month. China is the world's biggest solar panel producer.
Trump also is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminum or other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices.
In response, China's commerce ministry launched an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe into imports of sorghum from the U.S. over the weekend.
The moves have rekindled concerns of a trade war.
""The uncertainty surrounding Sino-US trade ties remains a key potential downside risk in the near term,"" said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.

Sharp gains in the yuan are also threatening China's competitiveness, with an official business survey last week suggesting the currency's appreciation led to a decline in big exporters' activity last month.

653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>","China Exports Hold Up as Commodities, Base Effects Boost Imports","(Bloomberg) -- China’s overseas shipments held up despite the stronger yuan and rising trade tensions with the U.S., while import growth surged reflecting calendar effects and higher commodity prices.
Key Points
Big Picture
External demand has remained intact amid a synchronized global expansion, helping to offset the yuan’s continued surge. Still, the world’s largest exporter faces uncertainty. Trade friction between the two biggest economies has ratcheted up recently, with China probing sorghum imports from the U.S. after the Trump administration slapped tariffs on solar panels and washers, which Beijing called a ""misuse"" of trade measures.
Economist Takeaways
""High imports are related to base effects and rising commodities prices, which may give a lift to domestic inflation this year,"" said Liao Qun, chief economist at China Citic Bank International Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""Dollar-dominated oil prices rise as the dollar weakens, and the growth rose again when being converted into yuan terms.""
Trade friction will likely intensify this year, but a trade war is unlikely, according to UBS Group AG economists led by Wang Tao in Hong Kong. ""Targeted tariffs and restrictions may hurt related stocks or sectors, but the macro impact on China’s exports or GDP growth will be very small as a stronger global recovery helps to drive 2018 export growth,"" she wrote.
""China imports more from the U.S. than their shipments to the U.S. As the trade tension of the two biggest nations intensifies, this figure is timely,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""The Chinese side is expected to use this number to show their effort to narrow the trade gap.""
""More working days would definitely have an impact,"" said Gai Xinzhe, an analyst at Bank of China’s research institute, referring to the holiday in January 2017. ""Though the yuan is getting much stronger against the dollar, its overall rates against other currencies are relatively stable, which could explain why exports data are better than expected. Trade data in the first two months are extremely volatile and it’s better to look at the first quarter data for a better picture.""

The study was done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to look at what was behind rapid price gains in major Canadian cities that have led some local authorities to take steps to try to cool markets.
The study found that three-quarters of the 48 percent price gain seen in Vancouver from 2010 to 2016 was attributable to economic factors, including increases in population, jobs and income, as well as low mortgage rates.
But in Toronto, where prices were up 40 percent over the same time frame, just 40 percent of the gain was attributable to fundamentals. The increased wealth of residents in Toronto also explains some of the price gains, CMHC said.
The report, which also looked at Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton, found that the supply response has been weaker in Toronto and Vancouver than the other cities.
Proportionally, more condominiums have been coming onto the market in those two cities than single detached homes, partly due to availability and price of land. Investor demand for condos has also increased, the report said.
""What seems to be happening is there's a supply response in terms of condominiums, but the prices for single detached homes are going up,"" said Aled ab Iorwerth, CMHC's deputy chief economist. ""So there is a weaker supply response there in the overall housing market.""
A separate report from CMHC released on Tuesday found that foreigners living in Canada boosted their share of mortgages in the last two years, as young home buyers were bankrolled by their parents overseas.
A backlash against foreign investors, particularly those from mainland China, has spurred provincial governments to impose a foreign buyers' tax in Vancouver in 2016 and in Toronto in 2017, although data shows offshore buyers account still only for between 5 and 10 percent of the market. 
CMHC said on Wednesday that more than half of recent home buyers in Toronto and Vancouver believe foreign buyers are influencing home prices.
Although Toronto's housing market pulled back last year after the Ontario government's moves, data earlier this month suggested prices have stabilized.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Prices in Venezuela rose 4,068 percent in the 12 months to the end of January, according to estimates by the country's opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists' figures.
Inflation in January alone was 84.2 percent, opposition lawmakers said, amid an economic crisis in which millions of Venezuelans are suffering food and medicine shortages.
The monthly figure implies annualized inflation of more than 150,000 per cent and that prices will double at least every 35 days. 
With cash in short supply and banking and communications infrastructures struggling, day-to-day transactions are becoming increasingly difficult for Venezuelans.
The government blames the problems on an economic war waged by the opposition and business leaders, with a helping hand from Washington.
Critics in turn blame strict currency controls, which were enacted by Hugo Chavez 15 years ago this week. The bolivar is down some 40 percent against the dollar in the last month alone.
A million dollars of Venezuelan bolivars bought when the currency controls were introduced would now be worth just $7 on the black market.
The government has not published inflation data for more than two years though has increased the minimum wage repeatedly in a nod to rising prices.

The government raised the minimum wage 40 percent on Jan. 1, making it roughly equivalent now to just over $1 per month.

Tepid wages suggest the government faces a difficult task in getting companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more this year at annual wage negotiations with labor unions.
The lackluster data also shows the Bank of Japan's 2 percent inflation target is likely to remain a distant goal.
Real wages fell 0.5 percent in December from the same period a year ago, labor ministry data showed on Wednesday. That followed a 0.1 percent annual increase in November and marked the biggest decline since a 1.1 percent annual decrease in July 2017.
For all of 2017, real wages fell 0.2 percent, following a 0.7 percent increase in the previous year.
Nominal cash earnings rose 0.7 percent in December from the same period a year earlier, slower than a 0.9 percent annual increase in the previous month, the data showed.
Special payments, which include bonuses, rose 0.7 percent on-year in December, following a revised 7.8 percent annual increase in November. The data suggest that many companies paid year-end bonuses in November instead of December.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose an annual 0.9 percent in December, slower than a revised 1.9 percent annual increase in November.
In April-June last year Japan's output gap showed demand exceeded supply by the most in more than nine years, according to BOJ data.
Central bank officials and economists outside the BOJ took that as a positive sign that inflation would start to accelerate and pull the economy further away from returning to deflation.
However, data on wages and overtime pay shows that it may take more time for the benefits of an improving output gap to show up in other parts of the economy.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

British gross domestic product will grow by 1.9 percent in 2018 and in 2019, the think tank said on Wednesday, up from its November forecasts of 1.7 percent for both years.
By comparison, the world economy is now set to expand by 3.9 and 3.8 percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively, up from NIESR's November forecasts of 3.6 and 3.5 percent.
Despite lagging the global upturn, Britain's economy has not slowed as sharply as many forecasters expected at the time of the decision by voters to leave the European Union
As well as the unexpectedly strong global recovery, NIESR said Britain was being helped by the fall in the value of sterling which was boosting British exports, and by December's deal between London and Brussels about the terms of Britain's divorce from the EU which cleared up some uncertainty. 
But it remains unclear what Brexit will mean for the world's sixth-biggest economy. Negotiations over Britain's future ties to the EU have yet to begin in earnest.
NIESR's forecasts were based on an assumption that London secures a deal that causes almost no disruption to British trade with the bloc. This would require politically sensitive concessions on immigration and long-term payments to the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May, it said.
If Britain instead resorts to World Trade Organisation rules to govern its trade with the EU, the economy would suffer a mild recession and would be 7 percent smaller in around 10 years' time than it would be if a favorable deal is done, NIESR said.
That would leave people in Britain an average of 2,000 pounds ($2,791) a year worse off.
NIESR kept its forecast for the Bank of England to raise rates by 25 basis points every six months, quicker than most investors expect, until they hit 2 percent.

The BoE said in November it expected Britain's economy would grow by 1.6 and 1.7 percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively. It is due to publish fresh forecasts on Thursday.

661,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>",Americans voluntarily quitting jobs as labor market tightens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of American workers voluntarily quitting their jobs jumped in December to the highest level in nearly 17 years, in a strong show of confidence in the labor market which further bolsters expectations of faster wage growth this year.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report published on Tuesday came on the heels of news last week that annual wage growth in January was the strongest in more than 8-1/2 years. The labor market is almost at full employment.
The number of workers willingly leaving their jobs increased by 98,000 to 3.259 million, the highest level since January 2001. That lifted the quits rate to a 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in November. This rate, which the Federal Reserve looks at as a measure of job market confidence, has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in late 2009.
""I had thought that by now, the fear of moving to another company would have faded,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It really hadn't very much, though maybe it is finally happening.""Rising job turnover boosts economists' optimism that wage growth will accelerate this year and in turn help to push inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target. While economists remain confident that the U.S. central bank will increase interest rates at least three times this year, much would depend on the fortunes of the U.S. stock market.
Stocks on Wall on Monday recorded their biggest drop since August 2011 as concerns over rising U.S. interest rates and government bond yields hit record-high valuations of stocks.
""The data today are likely to keep the Fed on the path of gradual rate hikes this year as long as the stock market stabilizes from its death plunge the last two weeks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""Labor market conditions are picture perfect today, but that can change in a hurry if worsening financial conditions and plunging markets take a toll on business confidence.""
The JOLTS report also showed that job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 167,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.8 million. Still, job openings are not too far from a record high of 6.2 million touched in September.
The decline in job openings in December was led by the professional and business services sector, which saw a decrease of 119,000. Job openings in the retail trade sector fell 85,000 while vacancies in construction dropped 52,000.
But job openings in the information sector increased 33,000 and the federal government had an additional 13,000 vacancies in December. The jobs openings rate slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent in December.
Hiring was little changed at 5.49 million.

""The recent moderation across much of the JOLTS data is not alarming to us given that levels still remain favorable across much of the data and that we have been expecting the pace of job growth to cool relative to the recent strong gains,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit rises to nine-year high on robust imports,"By Lucia Mutikani and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December to its highest level since 2008, as robust domestic demand pushed imports to a record high, adding to the stiff headwinds faced by the Trump administration's ""America First"" trade policies.
The import-driven surge in the trade gap reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday also suggests 3 percent annual economic growth may be hard to achieve. Imports, which subtract from gross domestic product, could get a further boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that became effective in January. 
The fiscal stimulus comes with the economy almost at full employment, which means the resulting increase in demand will likely be satisfied with imports. Companies would also need to invest in equipment, some of which is bought overseas, to boost production.
""Trump's trade team has not been able to stem the flood of imports into the country,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Don't forget it is American companies assembling goods outside the country and then bringing them back in which is the problem with the trade imbalance in goods."" 
The trade deficit increased 5.3 percent to $53.1 billion in December, the highest level since October 2008. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $52.0 billion in December. Part of the rise in the trade gap reflected higher commodity price increases. 
The deficit surged 12.1 percent to $566.0 billion in 2017, the highest since 2008. That represented 2.9 percent of GDP, up from 2.7 percent in 2016. 
The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit jumped 8.1 percent to a record $375.2 billion last year. President Donald Trump has vowed to shrink the trade gap by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement unless the 1994 pact linking Canada, Mexico and the United States can be made more favorable to Washington. And his administration has launched an investigation into China's intellectual property practices that could lead to major new trade sanctions on Beijing.
""Many American factory workers bought into the promise of the president's trade policy reforms, but they are still waiting for results,"" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit increased to $68.4 billion from $66.5 billion in November. 
The jump in the so-called real trade deficit at the end of the year puts trade on course to be a drag on GDP in the first quarter. Trade subtracted 1.13 percentage point from economic growth in the final three months of 2017. 
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate during that period, helping to lift growth in 2017 to 2.3 percent from 1.5 percent in 2016.
U.S. stocks rose in volatile trading following the biggest one-day declines for the S&P 500 index (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) in more than six years. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies as investors sought a safe-haven from the stock market rout. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher. 
BROAD TARIFFS
The Trump administration believes a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis. Late in January, Trump imposed broad tariffs on imported solar panels and large washing machines, and is considering slapping tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum for national security reasons.
Such actions may prove politically popular with Trump's working-class supporters, particularly in states hard-hit by factory closures and import competition. But economists say they would likely do little to change the growth trajectory of the overall trade deficit, which is tied more to macroeconomic factors.
Goods imports increased 2.9 percent to a record $210.8 billion in December. Imports of food, capital and consumer goods were the highest on record in December. Imports of consumer goods were buoyed by pharmaceutical preparations, cellphones and motor vehicles.
Imports are being driven by robust domestic demand, which grew at its quickest pace in more than three years in the fourth quarter. The country's import bill in December was also pushed up by more expensive crude oil, which averaged $52.10 per barrel, the highest price since July 2015.
""Tax reform is probably going to put further pressure on the trade and current account deficit as firms invest in more capital equipment to increase productive capacity,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Economics in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Imports from China fell 7.6 percent in December. There were also declines in goods imported from Canada and Mexico, the United States' major trading partners.
Exports of goods increased 2.5 percent to $137.5 billion in December, the highest level since October 2014. Exports of capital goods hit a record high, lifted by civilian aircraft and industrial machines.
There were also gains in exports of industrial supplies and materials. Petroleum exports increased to their highest level since August 2014.
Exports are being boosted by a strengthening global economy. A weakening dollar is also making American-made goods more competitive on the international market.

Exports to China surged 7.5 percent to a record high in December. As a result, the U.S.-China trade deficit declined 13 percent in December.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank struck an upbeat tune about the country's economy on Tuesday, steering a steady rate path at its first meeting of 2018 even as global markets went into a tailspin.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) optimism was underpinned by solid economic data in recent weeks, topped by strong fourth-quarter retail sales figures on Tuesday which augured well for household consumption.
The RBA held rates at 1.5 percent and steered clear of even mentioning the rout in global markets, which saw Wall Street sliding the most in a single day since 2011. 
Cash rates in Australia have now been steady for 1-1/2 years, the longest spell of stable rates since the mid-1990s.
""The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy,"" Governor Philip Lowe said in the policy decision statement. 
""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.""
The bank narrowly upgraded its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average ""a bit above 3 percent"" over the next couple of years. 
""The data over the summer have been consistent with this outlook,"" Lowe added. 
SOLID DATA
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales beat expectations for the fourth quarter as a whole to rise a rapid 0.9 percent in inflation-adjusted terms. That followed a very sedate 0.1 percent gain the previous quarter.
The revival greatly improved the outlook for GDP growth, given household spending accounts for around 57 percent of annual economic output.
Consumers are spending elsewhere too with new vehicle sales hitting another record in January. Besides, measures of business and consumer confidence have also lifted in recent weeks. 
Fourth quarter GDP data is due on March 7.
Despite all that, household consumption still remained a source of uncertainty for the RBA, Lowe said. 
Consumer spending has been under pressure from record-high household debt and sluggish wage growth, one reason the RBA is in no rush to raise interest rates from record lows.
Inflation has undershot the RBA's 2-3 target for more than two years now and it is only expected to pick up gradually. 
Futures markets <0#YIB;> imply around a 50-50 chance of a hike by November and are not fully priced for a rise until early next year. The local dollar slipped further after the RBA statement to $0.7849. 
Other data out Tuesday showed Australia recorded a trade deficit of A$1.36 billion ($1.07 billion) in December, confounding forecasts of a A$200 million surplus.
However, November's result was revised sharply to show a surplus of A$36 million, from an initial deficit of A$628 million, in part reflecting updated prices for iron ore and coal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity raced to a near 12-1/2-year high in January, buoyed by robust growth in new orders, the latest sign of strong momentum in the economy at the start of the year.
Economic growth is showing strength even before the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which came into effect last month, has started to filter through. That is causing concern that the economy could overheat. 
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has risen to a four-year high as investors anticipate a slightly faster pace of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve than has been expected. (Graphic: U.S. and world services PMI DataStream Chart - http://tmsnrt.rs/2fffv4X) 
The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after raising borrowing costs three times in 2017. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey on Monday added to a report on Friday showing a pickup in job gains in January and the strongest annual wage growth in more than 8-1/2 years.
""All of this is before the actual effects of the tax cuts have had time to kick in,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The combination of strong employment growth and rising cost pressures will keep the Fed on course for a rate hike in March and we continue to believe the Fed will hike four times in 2018.""
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index jumped 3.9 points to 59.9, the highest reading since August 2005. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
New orders jumped 8.2 points to 62.7, the best reading since January 2011. Services industry respondents tied the surge in orders to the tax cuts and the strengthening economy. The survey's production index rose 2.0 points and a measure of services sector employment soared 5.3 points to a record high.
REASSURING SIGN
The bullish ISM survey, however, likely overstates the health of the economy. A separate survey from data firm Markit, showed its services sector PMI fell to a nine-month low in January. But the survey's new orders gauge rose last month.
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017 and is expected to hit the Trump administration's 3 percent target this year, before slowing in 2018.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower, though the yield on the benchmark 10-year note backed off a four-year high. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street fell.
""The ISM indices have been especially volatile in recent months, but January's release is a reassuring sign that the economy has continued to gather momentum at the beginning of 2018,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
Respondents to the ISM survey offered an upbeat assessment of business for the first quarter. Finance and insurance industry executives reported ""signs of strong growth (in) financial performance expectations given the recent tax changes."" 
Their professional, scientific and technical services counterparts said the ""outlook continues to look bright for 2018."" The survey also showed services industries paying more for materials, which fits in with expectations of higher inflation and interest rates this year.
""With the prices paid component of the ISM also continuing to trend higher in January, we think the Fed will be forced to step up the pace of policy tightening this year, delivering a total of four rate hikes,"" said Pearce. 

Industries reported receiving more export orders. They also reported an increase in imports, which economists said could weigh on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. Imports subtracted almost 2 percentage points from GDP growth in the fourth quarter.

The prior month’s reading was 56.0.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed sharply in January, according to a survey that cast doubt on growing expectations among investors that the Bank of England might be gearing up to raise interest rates again in the coming months.
Sterling fell and British government bonds briefly rose after financial data firm IHS Markit said growth in the world's sixth-biggest economy looked set to slow to 0.3 percent in the first quarter, down from 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2017.
The slowdown was driven mostly by Britain's dominant services sector, where activity growth fell to a 16-month low of 53.0 last month from 54.2 in December, as measured by IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).
By contrast, euro zone businesses began 2018 with their strongest growth in well over a decade, IHS Markit said - figures that highlighted the gap between Britain, as it heads for Brexit, and its European neighbors.
Combined with weaker-than-expected surveys last week for Britain's manufacturing and construction sectors, Monday's report suggested the country grew last month at its slowest pace since just after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.
""With the survey also indicating weaker upward price pressures, the data therefore cast doubts on any imminent rise in interest rates,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
But George Buckley, an economist with Nomura, said the survey suggested growth might slow only to 0.4 percent - enough to keep the BoE on track to raise rates four times between now and the end of 2019, more than investors currently expect.
The BoE is due to announce new economic forecasts on Thursday and investors are watching for any signs that it is moving towards a rate hike in the coming months, after it raised rates in November for the first time in a decade.
Britain's economy grew faster than anticipated at the end of 2017, and financial markets have put a 50-50 chance on a BoE rate hike in May.
Monday's survey showed companies blamed the slowdown on the non-renewal of old contracts, bad weather and a loss of clients, as well as uncertainty about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations facing British Prime Minister Theresa May.
Although new work came in faster than in December, it was below the average for 2017.
But there were some positives. Job creation picked up as services firms remain positive about the outlook and business confidence was the highest since March 2017.

Inflation in the prices charged by firms eased to a four-month low but remained high. Input prices rose at their slowest pace since September 2016.

Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.1 percent month-on-month in December against a 2.0 percent rise in November and against market expectations of a 1.0 percent decline.
In year-on-year terms, retail sales rose 1.9 percent, as expected, a sharp slowdown from a 3.9 percent yea-on-year rise in the previous month.
The monthly numbers were mainly affected by a 1.5 percent decline in the volume of sold automotive fuel and a 3.3 percent fall in the volume of sold clothes and shoes. 

Year-on-year a 0.8 percent decline in sold fuel as well as a lower rise in the volume of sold food drinks and tobacco were behind the slow-down.

The IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.0 in January, compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.1.
The prior month’s reading was 54.2.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The research group indicated that services output rose at its slowest pace since September 2016, while new order growth was weaker than the 2017 average.
“Price pressures remain elevated, but wane as costs show smallest rise for 16 months,” the report showed.
“The softer service sector growth follows news of the manufacturing upturn losing momentum at the start of the year and a near-stagnant construction sector,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
“All together, the PMI surveys point to the slowest pace of expansion since August 2016,” he noted.
Williamson indicated that the January number suggest that growth would slow to just 0.3% from the fourth quarter reading of 0.4% to 0.5%.
“The January slowdown pushes the all-sector PMI into dovish territory as far as Bank of England monetary policy is concerned, historically consistent with a loosening bias,” Williamson explained.
“With the survey also indicating weaker upward price pressures, the data therefore cast doubts on any imminent rise in interest rates,” he concluded."
671,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone businesses start 2018 in best shape for over a decade: PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses started 2018 by increasing activity faster than at any time in well over a decade as new orders surged despite firms raising prices at the steepest rate in almost seven years, a survey showed.
The euro zone emerged as one of the best-performing major economies last year, and forward-looking indicators in the survey suggest that momentum will continue for at least another few months, in welcome news for the European Central Bank as it moves to unwind policy.
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall growth indicator for the euro zone, rose to 58.8 in January from December's 58.1 and up from the flash estimate of 58.6.
It is now at its highest since June 2006 and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The strong upturn is also broad-based, which adds to the potential for the growth to become more self-sustaining as demand rises across the single currency area,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The survey data are therefore indicating that the euro zone has started 2018 with very good growth momentum, and that price pressures are building commensurately. If such impressive numbers continue to be seen in coming months, expect policymakers to sound increasingly hawkish.""
Although inflation is still nowhere near their target ceiling of 2 percent, ECB policymakers halved their monthly asset purchases from January and are expected to end the quantitative easing program completely by the end of the year.
So they will be heartened to see an index measuring prices charged leapt to 54.8 from December's 53.2, it's highest since April 2011.
Williamson said the PMI data, if maintained, pointed to first quarter GDP growth of 1.0 percent, which would be the best since the second quarter of 2010 and much faster than the 0.6 percent predicted by a Reuters poll last month.
Growth is being supported by a booming service industry. Its PMI bounced to 58.0 from 56.6, surpassing the flash estimate of 57.6 and chalking up its highest reading since August 2007.
That growth was boosted by new business flooding in at the fastest rate in over a decade. The sub-index was 57.3, up from 56.7 the month before to a level also not seen since August 2007.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 10:39PM ET</span>",China's service sector grows at fastest pace in nearly six years in January: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector got off to a flying start in 2018, expanding at its fastest pace in almost six years as new orders surged and companies rushed to hire more staff, a private survey showed on Monday.
Economists also attributed the robust strength in services in January to better access to bank loans at the start of the year and solid demand before the long Lunar New Year celebrations, which fall in mid-February. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 54.7 in January from December's 53.9, marking the highest reading since May 2012.
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The upbeat findings, which echoed those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector last week, bode well for Beijing's longer-term goal of overhauling and modernizing its economic growth model. 
The government is counting on growth in consumption and services, particularly in high value-added areas such as finance and technology, to reduce the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry, investment and exports.
The services sector already accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
New business increased at the fastest pace in 32 months, the Caixin survey showed, with respondents linking the rise to new projects, company expansions and greater initiatives to win new clients. 
The effort led companies to hire new workers at the fastest pace in five months. 
Better access to financing likely also played a role in the sharp improvement in business conditions, some analysts said. The survey focuses on small and medium-sized firms which traditionally tend to have a tougher time securing funds than their larger state-owned peers.
""Banks normally dole out more credit at the start of the year, as opposed to being restrained by the lending quota last year,"" said Wendy Chen, a Shanghai-based economist at Nomura. 
""IT-related services are a big driver behind the growth in services. We expect it to continue its momentum for the remainder of the year.""
However, firms' strong optimism about the business outlook over the next year eased to a four-month low on concerns that economic conditions may soften. 
Profit margins also remained under pressure. Many companies reported a stiff rise in input costs for raw materials, transportation and salaries, but the survey suggested they were having a tough time passing higher costs on to their customers.
The official services PMI out last week showed activity accelerated to a four-month high in January, indicating broader economic resilience. That survey tends to focus more on larger and state-supported firms. 
Retail, information technology and insurance services all sustained high growth rates in January, the official data showed.
Driven by strong readings in both the services and manufacturing sectors, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI rose to 53.7 in January, compared to 53.0 in December and the highest since January 2011. 
""Looking forward, we should watch for stability of demand in the manufacturing industry and the impact of growing costs on the profitability of service providers,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.
The world's second-biggest economy reported forecast-beating growth of 6.9 percent last year, handily beating the government's target of around 6.5 percent. 
Economists polled by Reuters are penciling in more moderate growth of 6.5 percent this year, citing the expected drag from higher borrowing costs, a crackdown on air pollution and a cooling housing market.

Sustained and robust services growth, however, could offset softer industrial growth and increase the chance of an upside surprise.

The 1.6 percent increase in rents was also the first below-inflation rise since 2013, according to the index compiled by the Deposit Protection Service which runs a deposit protection scheme for landlords and tenants.
Rents in London rose most slowly, up only 0.4 percent.
""The current slowdown in fact began in mid-2016 and is likely to be linked to the EU referendum result,"" Julian Foster, DPS managing director, said. 
""It will be interesting to watch the index as the UK government’s negotiations with the EU and other economic influences progress during 2018.""
British house prices saw a similar slowdown last year when they rose at their slowest pace since 2012 across the country and fell in London for the first time since 2009, mortgage lender Nationwide said in January.

Britain's economy has held up better than most forecasts made at the time of the decision by voters to leave the EU in June 2016, but it is growing more slowly than most other big, advanced nations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in January and wages increased further, recording their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years, bolstering expectations that inflation will push higher this year as the labor market hits full employment.
Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 200,000 jobs last month after rising 160,000 in December, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in January to $26.74, building on December's solid 0.4 percent gain.
That boosted the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest rise since June 2009, from 2.7 percent in December. Workers, however, put in fewer hours last month likely because of bitterly cold weather. 
The average workweek fell to 34.3 hours, the shortest in four months, from 34.5 hours in December.
The robust employment report underscored the strong momentum in the economy, raising the possibility that the Federal Reserve could be a bit more aggressive in raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after raising borrowing costs three times in 2017.
""The acceleration in average hourly earnings growth punches a hole in the narrative that wage growth remains lackluster,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. ""The Goldilocks view of inflation is being sorely challenged right now.""
Fed officials on Wednesday expressed optimism that inflation will rise toward the central bank's target this year. Policymakers, who voted to keep interest rates unchanged, described the labor market as having ""continued to strengthen,"" and economic activity as ""rising at a solid rate."" 
U.S. financial markets have priced in a rate hike in March. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hitting a four-year high as investors worried about high inflation. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data while U.S. stocks were trading lower.
The unemployment rate dropped seven-tenths of a percentage point in 2017 and economists expect it to hit 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Economists say job gains are being driven by buoyant domestic and global demand. 
Some worry that the Trump administration's $1.5 billion tax cut package passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December, in the biggest overhaul of the tax code in 30 years, could cause the economy, already operating near full capacity, to overheat. 
President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have cast the fiscal stimulus, which includes a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, as creating jobs and boosting economic growth.
""If the labor market is this strong and the tax cuts have yet to kick in, what will it look like when households and businesses actually start spending the money?"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland Pennsylvania. ""No good economy goes unpunished and the punishment may already be starting to be meted out.""

JOB GROWTH SEEN SLOWING
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1 percent. January's jobs gains were above the monthly average of 192,000 over the past three months. 
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
January marked the first full year of employment data under the Trump administration. Job growth averaged 176,000 per month under the current government, compared to 208,300 during last year of the Obama administration. 
Job growth is expected to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment. Companies are already reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, which economists say will force some to significantly raise wages as they compete for scarce labor.
Wage growth last month came as increases in the minimum wage came into effect in 18 states in January. Wages probably also got a lift from the tax cut. Companies like  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) have said they will use some of the savings from lower taxes to boost wages for workers. 
Further gains are expected in February when Walmart (NYSE:WMT) raises entry-level wages for hourly employees at its U.S. stores. Annual wage growth is now close to the 3 percent that economists say is needed to push inflation towards the Fed's 2 percent target. 
But the road to faster wage growth remains long. The year-on-year rise in average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers was stuck at 2.4 percent in January. 
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 8.2 percent in January.
The unemployment rate for African Americans shot up to 7.7 percent from 6.8 percent and is more than double that of whites. 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 15,000 last month after rising 21,000 in December. The sector is being supported by strong domestic and international demand. A weak dollar is also providing a boost to manufacturing by making U.S.-made goods more competitive on the international market.
Hiring at construction sites picked up last month despite unseasonably cold weather. Construction payrolls increased by 36,000 jobs, adding to December's 33,000 gain. 
Retail employment rebounded and the government added jobs following two straight months of declines. 

There were also increases in payrolls for professional and business services, leisure and hospitality as well as healthcare and social assistance.

Factory goods orders rose 1.7 percent, advancing for a fifth straight month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. November's report was revised to show orders jumping 1.7 percent instead of the previously reported 1.3 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders climbing 1.5 percent in December. Orders increased 6.0 percent in 2017.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, dropped 0.6 percent in December instead of falling 0.3 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods edged up 0.1 percent in November.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.4 percent in December instead of increasing 0.6 percent as reported last month. Core capital goods shipments rose 0.3 percent in November.
Business spending soared last year, in part as companies anticipated a massive cut in the corporate income tax rate, which was passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. 
The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Business spending increased in the fourth quarter at its fastest clip in more than three years.

Strong business spending, a weakening dollar and strengthening global economy are supporting manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
In December, orders for machinery rose 0.4 percent after falling 0.3 percent in November. Orders for industrial machinery rebounded 4.3 percent after slumping 4.4 percent. Orders for transportation equipment surged 7.1 percent after increasing 4.5 percent in November. 
But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.9 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products slipped 0.1 percent.

The data beat the consensus estimate for the creation of 184,000 jobs but was lower than 234,000 that the ADP report indicated on Wednesday.
December’s reading of NFP was revised to 160,000 from the initial 148,000 registered initially.
The jobless rate met expectations by holding steady at 4.1%.
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.3% month-on-month in January, in line with forecasts and the prior month’s increase.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.9% in January.
That beat expectations for just a 2.6% increase.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created more new job contracts than expected in January with a total of 196,000.
Analysts had forecast just 180,000 new jobs in the private sector..
December’s number was revised to an increase of 166,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 146,000 jobs in the private sector.
Government payrolls increased by 4,000 last month.
In December, 6,000 government jobs were destroyed which was a downward revision from the initial reading of the creation of 2,000 public positions.
The participation rate remained unchanged at 62.7% in January. 
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, increased to 8.2% last month from December’s reading of 8.1%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to grow for an eighth straight quarter in October-December, the longest period of expansion in about 30 years, a Reuters poll found on Friday, led by robust exports and solid domestic demand.
Gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have expanded at an annualized rate of 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the poll of 19 analysts found.
That would be the longest streak of growth since a 12-quarter stretch of growth between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989 around the height of Japan's notorious economic bubble.
The pace of growth likely slowed in the fourth quarter from annualized 2.5 percent growth in the third quarter, but analysts believe the deceleration will be temporary.
The expected annual expansion would translate into 0.2 percent growth from the previous quarter. 
""The economy is forecast to improve thanks to both domestic and foreign demand on the back of recovering the global economy,"" Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute said in the survey.
""But we need to be vigilant about financial market fluctuations, a slowdown in China's economy, and geo-political risk from North Korea.""
Poll respondents also noted rises in import costs from new-model smartphones and higher oil prices would trim Japan's trade surplus. But exports were expected to remain strong on robust shipments of goods such as cars and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. 
The median forecast saw capital spending rising 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, up for a fifth straight quarter, on buying of equipment to ease labor shortages and brisk demand from semiconductor makers.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.4 percent for the quarter, recovering from a 0.5 percent fall in the third quarter, the poll predicted. The poll showed the economy received no contribution from external demand - or exports minus imports - after it contributed 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth in July-September.
The Cabinet Office will publish the GDP data on Feb. 14 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Feb. 13).
Japan's current account balance was seen likely to show a surplus of 1.02 trillion yen ($9.30 billion) in December, shrinking from a 1.35 trillion yen of surplus in November as higher oil import costs trimmed the trade surplus, the poll found.
The finance ministry will release the data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Feb. 8, Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against a basket of currencies on Friday and was on track for a weekly fall as investors focused on renewed economic strength in the eurozone.
The yen, meanwhile, edged down after a special bond purchase operation by the Bank of Japan to stem the rise in Japanese bond yields ,which had tracked their global peers higher. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, inched 0.1 percent higher to 88.758 , holding above a three-year low of 88.429 set one week ago but still down 0.4 percent for the week.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached a high of 2.797 percent early on Friday, probing its highest levels since April 2014.
""It's kind of counterintuitive. You'd think that with rates up, the dollar would be up, but investors are focusing their interest elsewhere,"" such as further evidence that the European economy is picking up, said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
A survey released on Thursday showed eurozone manufacturing continued to boom last month, supporting expectations that the European Central Bank is on track to normalize monetary policy.
The euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2506, but remained within sight of last week's 3-year high of $1.2538. For the week, it was up 0.6 percent.
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar rose 0.3 percent on the day to 109.73, moving away from a four-month nadir of 108.28 hit a week ago.
On Friday, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to 10 years left to maturity at 2 basis points above the previous close, which is 0.110 percent -- the same level at which it has offered similar unlimited buying in the past.
The BOJ also increased the amount of its planned buying in five- to 10-year JGBs to 450 billion yen from the previous 410 billion, an amount it had kept since late August.
Foreign exchange markets were largely unfazed by the Japanese central bank's move. The dollar drifted to its session low of 109.28 yen shortly afterward, before pushing higher.
""The BOJ's move today didn't have much of a forex market impact, as many market participants don't believe the BOJ wants to further expand its balance sheet,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. 
""So today's announcement does not have much power to lift the dollar,"" he said. 
Later on Friday, investors will be watching the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, for the latest clues on the strength of the U.S. labor market.
Nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, though many market participants expect a rate hike in March.

The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year, the same as in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed in January amid a fall in new orders, but an unexpected drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week pointed to sustained labor market strength that should underpin domestic demand.
The economy's healthy fundamentals were also underscored by other data on Thursday showing a solid increase in construction spending in December. A decline in worker productivity in the fourth quarter, however, suggested it may be hard to maintain the strong pace of economic growth.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday described the labor market as having ""continued to strengthen,"" and economic activity as ""rising at a solid rate."" The U.S. central bank left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged. U.S. financial markets are expecting a rate hike in March. 
""The demand is there, but manufacturers are struggling to keep up,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 59.1 last month from 59.3 in December. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The survey's production and employment sub-indexes fell in January as did a gauge of new orders. The moderation in orders is likely to be temporary against the backdrop of strong domestic and global demand. 
Manufacturers reported an increase in export orders and most offered an upbeat assessment of business conditions. 
Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said ""budgets are being approved for new projects."" Furniture manufacturers reported that ""our usual winter slowdown has not occurred, and we are very busy with new orders."" 
Domestic demand increased at its fastest pace in more than three years in the fourth quarter. A weak dollar, which lost 7 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners last year, is making U.S.-made goods more competitive on the international market.
The ISM survey also showed signs of a pickup in inflation, with a measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials increasing to its highest level since May 2011.
U.S. Treasury yields rose while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
NEAR FULL EMPLOYMENT 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Jan. 27. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 238,000 in the latest week. 
Last week marked the 152nd straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""The untapped reservoir of unemployed or underemployed skilled workers that existed in the aftermath of the recession has largely disappeared,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""Employers are finding it more difficult to find potential workers.""
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. A tightening of labor market conditions has raised optimism among Fed officials that inflation will rise toward the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target this year.
The claims data has no bearing on January's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing by 148,000 in December. 
Skilled worker shortages and weak productivity could put pressure on companies seeking to expand their businesses, economists say. That could spur corporate investments in automation to increase efficiency and output, according to Plante Moran Financial Advisors' Baird. 
In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 0.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
That was the first drop and weakest performance since the first quarter of 2016 and followed a 2.7 percent pace of increase in the third quarter.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, productivity increased at a rate of 1.1 percent. It rose 1.2 percent in 2017, the fastest since 2015, after dipping 0.1 percent in 2016. 
Soft productivity suggests it would be hard for the economy to hit the Trump administration's 3 percent annual growth target even with the $1.5 trillion tax cut package passed by Congress in December. Gross domestic product rose 2.3 percent in 2017. 
""Weak productivity and slowing population growth is not a recipe for success when it comes to the story of sustainable economic growth of 3 percent in coming years,"" said Chris Rupkey chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""It is looking more and more that the productivity trend will make it impossible for those $1.5 trillion of tax cuts to be paid for by faster economic growth that improves incomes and leads to greater tax revenues.""Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a pace of 2.0 percent in the final three months of 2017 after slipping at a rate of 0.1 percent in the third quarter. They gained 0.2 percent in 2017, the smallest increase since 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in 2016.

A fourth report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed construction spending rose 0.7 percent to an all-time high of $1.25 trillion. It advanced 2.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",UK manufacturing growth falls back to seven-month low: PMI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing lost some of its recent strong momentum last month as factories were held back by overall weakness in the economy in the run-up to Brexit, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 55.3 in January, its lowest since June 2017, though still well above its long-run average of 51.7.
If sustained, that performance would lead to quarterly growth of 0.6 percent for the sector -- better than the broader economy but only half the rate of the final three months of 2017.
The survey also showed one of the biggest jumps in the cost of raw materials in decades.
Manufacturing has been a bright spot in an otherwise sluggish British economy since the Brexit vote in 2016.
Exporters have been helped by last year's global economic recovery, which is expected to carry on in 2018.
While manufacturers reported improved growth in exports during January, the PMI's gauge of total new orders declined, pointing to weaker domestic demand.
Sterling weakened slightly against the dollar after the figures.
""The January PMI fuels suspicion that while the outlook for manufacturing continues to look bright on the export side, domestic conditions could well prove challenging over the coming months,"" said Howard Archer, economist at the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
January's data showed foreign demand was still growing at one of the fastest rates in the past four years.
But British manufacturers have not done as well as their competitors in continental Europe and the prospects at home for 2018 do not look so bright. Despite improving in January, the British PMI's gauge of factory export orders lagged behind all other major European economies.
Overall new orders expanded at the weakest pace since June 2017. Consumer goods makers in particular have suffered from weak domestic demand due to higher inflation. 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that business investment was lower than it should be due to uncertainty about Britain's future trade relations with the European Union, which it is due to leave in March 2019.
Oil prices rose to their highest in more than three years last month, and Thursday's data showed manufacturers reported their third-biggest monthly increase in costs since the survey started in 1992.
Oil, chemicals, foodstuffs, metals and plastics all became dearer, and factories passed some of the extra cost on to customers.
This may concern the BoE, which is reassessing how fast inflation will fall this year. Inflation peaked at its highest in more than five years in November, when the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.
""The move in the price balances of the manufacturing PMI highlights the risk that consumer price inflation may not slow that quickly, even as the influence of past FX depreciation wanes,"" Nomura economist George Buckley wrote.

Most economists expect the BoE will not raise rates again until November, though a minority think an increase will come in May. The central bank will set out its latest thoughts on Feb. 8.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday construction spending rose 0.7 percent to an all-time high of $1.25 trillion. November's construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.6 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent advance.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.4 percent in December. Construction spending advanced 2.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. It increased 3.8 percent in 2017, the smallest gain since 2011, after rising 6.5 percent in 2016.
In December, spending on private construction projects rose 0.8 percent to a record high of $963.2 billion after increasing 0.7 percent in November. Outlays on private residential projects gained 0.5 percent to the highest level since March 2007 after surging 1.1 percent in November. 
Spending on nonresidential structures jumped 1.1 percent in December after climbing 0.3 percent in the prior month. 
The government reported last week that spending on nonresidential structures such as oil and gas well drilling rebounded in the fourth quarter after slumping in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2017, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.2 percent rate.

Outlays on public construction projects rose 0.3 percent in December after edging up 0.1 percent in November. Spending on federal government construction projects jumped 10.9 percent, the largest increase since October 2014. State and local government construction outlays fell 0.6 percent.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of manufacturing activity decreased to 59.1 last month from December’s reading of 59.7.
Analysts had forecast the index to drop to 58.8.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
Meanwhile, the new orders index fell to 65.4 in January from 67.4 a month earlier.
The employment index declined to 54.2 last month from the prior 58.1. Economists forecast a smaller drop to 57.0.
The prices paid index unexpectedly increased to 72.7 in January, from the previous reading of 69.0. Economists had forecast the reading to drop to 68.0.
“Comments from the panel reflect expanding business conditions, with new orders and production maintaining high levels of expansion; employment expanding at a slower rate; order backlogs expanding at a faster rate; and export orders and imports continuing to grow faster in January,” the ISM noted.
Additionally, the report indicated that supplier deliveries continued to slow (improving) at a faster rate, while price increases occurred across all industry sectors.
The ISM further also indicated that “the Customers’ Inventories Index indicates levels are still too low.”"
684,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Productivity Fell Last Quarter to Extend Sluggish Run,"(Bloomberg) -- Productivity in the U.S. unexpectedly fell for the first time since early 2016 as working hours slightly outpaced output, underscoring a sluggish pace of efficiency gains during this expansion, a Labor Department report showed Thursday.
Key Takeaways
The data reinforce the trend of relatively paltry gains since the last recession ended, limiting the scope for economic growth to pick up without causing an unwanted acceleration in inflation. For the full year, productivity rose 1.2 percent, in line with the pace over the last decade.
The latest report also underscores that productivity figures can be volatile from quarter to quarter, and that the underlying trend may not have changed much despite the third quarter registering the fastest increase since early 2015.
Incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that labor-force participation and productivity gains are key to lifting the sustainable rate of expansion in the world’s largest economy. Without a boost in productivity, President Donald Trump may find it difficult for growth to meet his 3 percent goal.
The Republican tax plan signed by Trump in December was aimed in part at making capital spending more attractive, which could help lift productivity. Equipment spending was resurgent in 2017, with such investment rising in the fourth quarter at the fastest pace since 2014.

686,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",UK Manufacturing PMI Unexpectedly Slows in January,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the UK unexpectedly slowed at the start of 2018, dampening optimism over the British economy, industry data showed on Thursday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its UK manufacturing PMI dropped to a seasonally adjusted 55.3 last month.
Analysts had expected the PMI to inch up to 56.5.
That compared to December’s reading of 56.2 which was revised down from the preliminary 56.3
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that the growth of output and new orders slowed further, while input cost and selling price inflation accelerated.
“The UK manufacturing sector reported an unwelcome combination of slower growth and rising prices at the start of 2018.,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit, said.
“Encouragingly, despite the slowdown, the latest survey is consistent with production rising at a solid quarterly rate of around 0.6% in January, with jobs also being added at a faster pace,” he added.
Regardless, Dobson warned that the output growth had undergone a sharp slowdown since last November’s high and while the more forward-looking new orders had hit a seven-month low.
“The trend in demand will need to strengthen in the near-term to prevent further growth momentum being lost in the coming months,” he explained.
With regard to prices, Dobson noted that recent easing in inflationary pressure saw a sharp reversal, as cost inflation hit an 11-month high at one of the highest levels in the series history.
He attributed the surge to the jump in oil prices and the fact that demand for many inputs surpassed supply, all of which pushed selling price inflation to its highest level in nine months.
“These price trends will be watched closely to see if the upsurge is simply a one-off spike or something more embedded,” Dobson concluded."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's booming manufacturing industry raced into 2018, churning out goods last month at one of the fastest paces in over 20 years, a survey showed, suggesting the economic recovery still has momentum.
In 2017 the bloc's economy was a surprise global star and any signs the energy, alongside rising price pressures, has carried into this year will be welcomed by the European Central Bank as it moves to unwind its super-loose monetary policy.
IHS Markit's January final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 59.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading but below December's 60.6 - which was the highest since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output that feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday and seen as a good gauge of economic health did fall to 61.1 from December's record high of 62.2 but has only been higher six times in the survey's 20-year history.
""The euro zone's manufacturing boom continued in full swing in January,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Among the bloc's four biggest economies, PMI readings remained close to record highs in Germany and Italy and among the best for 17 years and a decade in France and Spain respectively.
Indicating February would also be a busy month, new orders growth was at a near record pace as was employment. Firms also built up a solid backlog of work and were their most optimistic in at least 5-1/2 years.
In a development that is likely also to delight ECB policymakers, who have struggled for years to get inflation anywhere near their 2 percent target ceiling, factories increased their prices at the fastest rate since mid-2011.
Euro zone inflation dipped as expected to 1.3 percent in December, official data showed on Wednesday, although core inflation rose. The PMI sub-index measuring output prices jumped in January to 58.0 from 56.3.
Last week, the ECB decided to keep policy unchanged and held off discussing winding down its massive stimulus program, as inflation has yet to show any convincing upward trend.
The ECB will stop printing money by the end of the year, but a majority of economists polled by Reuters last month said they should do so much sooner, citing a solid and synchronized growth outlook for the currency bloc."
688,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Cuba revises data to show economy grew in 2016,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban official data released this week showed the economy grew 0.5 percent in 2016, an upwards revision from a preliminary government estimate of a 0.9 percent contraction.
President Raul Castro had told the National Assembly in Dec. 2016 that the centrally planned economy had shrunk in tandem with the crisis in key trading partner Venezuela.
But the long-overdue report by the National Statistics Office showed an uptick instead, with the trade surplus remaining steady after dropping in the previous year.
Exports of goods and services were $13.6 billion and imports $11.2 billion, compared with $14.9 billion and $12.6 billion in the previous year, the report showed. (http://www.onei.cu/aec2016/05%20Cuentas%20Nacionales.pdf)
The chapter of the 2016 abstract published this week, that includes specifics on gross domestic product, exports and money supply as well as data on debt, had been expected in the second half of last year.
Its absence had raised eyebrows among analysts and left would-be investors more in the dark than usual about the Communist-run economy.

Many were also surprised when in December when the government announced Cuba’s economy grew 1.6 percent in 2017, given the backdrop of falling subsidized oil shipments from Venezuela, lower exports and a cash crunch.

689,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>","Asian factories kick off 2018 on strong note, but inflation still missing","By Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's factories got off to a strong start in 2018, with manufacturing activity in many countries gaining momentum and hitting multi-year highs as global demand for hi-tech products remained strong.
Business surveys in Europe and the United States later on Thursday were also expected to show solid factory activity, reinforcing expectations of another year of synchronized global growth that has propelled stock markets to record highs.
Global policymakers are hoping that rosy scenario may finally translate into higher wages, spurring stronger domestic demand and inflation, which has been strangely absent from the recovery so far despite years of massive central bank monetary stimulus.
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that inflation was likely to pick up this year, bolstering expectations that U.S. interest rates will continue to rise, while the Bank of England said price growth was back on the agenda.
But official inflation data in Asia has remained tepid, even as business surveys suggest companies are charging their customers more to recoup rising input costs.
South Korea on Thursday posted its lowest inflation rate in 17 months, and prices are growing less than expected in Australia and New Zealand.
""The pick-up in manufacturing activity does not necessarily have to reflect in domestic inflationary pressures as they include non-tradeable sectors,"" said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong.
""(Asian) currencies have been strong, and there is still some weakness in domestic demand, particularly in the ageing east Asian countries such as Singapore and South Korea."" 
Nguyen added this will make Asian central banks generally less aggressive than the Fed, with Malaysia and Philippines, where domestic demand has been strong due to pre-election spending in the former and accelerated infrastructure investment in the latter likely to lead the way in rate hikes.
In light of the subdued South Korean inflation data, ING economists cut their forecasts for rate hikes in that country this year to only one from two previously, and not until the fourth quarter.
TECH TRADE
The strongest manufacturing readings in Asia on Thursday came from tech exporters, which continue to ride a robust semiconductor cycle driven by upgrades in smartphones, industrial robots, cars, and, more recently, demand for computing machines used to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
In Japan, the Markit/Nikkei Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 in January, the highest in four years.
Taiwan's reading rose to its highest since April 2011, while South Korean factory activity bounced back into expansion territory as domestic and export orders picked up. Levels above 50 suggest growth on a monthly basis.
Even in China -- where authorities are cracking down on air pollution and excessive financial risks -- factory growth last month appeared generally resilient, though economists agree the crackdowns will start to weigh on activity eventually.
The private Caixin/Markit PMI was steady at 51.5, matching December's reading and better than economists at expected, though official data on Wednesday suggested a slight softening as export orders faltered.
A clearer picture of China's manufacturing activity and its actual demand may not emerge until spring when winter smog restrictions are lifted and construction revives.
""Overall, we expect Asian manufacturing conditions to remain healthy, supported by robust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy,"" said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.
RISK OF PROTECTIONISM
However, the outlook for Asia's export-reliant economies remains clouded by worries about U.S. trade protectionism as the Trump administration starts translating last year's tough talk into action.
Washington slapped steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels last week, drawing protests from Beijing and Seoul, and U.S. officials suggest other measures are on the way.
While such steps could hurt growth, HSBC Private Banking's head of investment strategy for Asia Cheuk Wan Fan said there was no reason to panic as Asian countries trade more with each other than in the past and are less reliant on the United States.
Individual companies were therefore more at risk than the wider economic picture.

""When we look at the risk arising from U.S. protectionism and trade in-fighting, we adopt a bottom-up approach in identifying potential victims,"" she said. ""We will avoid these companies which heavily rely on U.S. export markets.""

690,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 12:41AM ET</span>",China January factory growth remains strong as output accelerates: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector sustained growth at multi-month highs in January, a private business survey showed on Thursday, as factories continued to raise output to meet new orders, suggesting resilience in the world's second-largest economy. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 51.5 in January, unchanged from the previous month. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast a drop to 51.3. 
December's reading was the highest in four months and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. 
Growth in factory output quickened to a 13-month high in January, and employment fell at its slowest pace in nearly three years.
The solid Caixin PMI readings could help reassure international investors that China's economy is still expanding at a healthy clip as it nurtures new drivers of growth.
The Chinese economy slowed slightly in the second half of last year from the first half amid a government crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs. 
Analysts expect some softening in economic expansion early this year after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent growth in 2017, the first annual acceleration in seven years.
An official survey released on Wednesday on manufacturing activity in January pointed to a slight loss of momentum.
""The downward pressure on the economy in the first quarter could be slightly bigger than the fourth quarter (last year),"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing.
""We expect first-quarter GDP growth to be around 6.7 percent.""
OUTLOOK FOR EXPORTS
Analysts say the divergence between the official and Caixin findings is mostly due to margins of error in the survey resulting from different sample sizes and calculation methods.
The Caixin survey also tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which are believed to be more export-oriented. 
""The manufacturing industry had a good start to 2018. Going forward, we should keep a close eye on the stability of the demand side,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
Input cost inflation eased to a five-month low in January, the survey shows, allaying concerns that broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. 
New orders and new export orders, while higher, rose at a slower pace. 
Dimming the outlook for exports, Chen Zhongtao, an official with the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, said on Wednesday the yuan's recent appreciation has led to a decline in big exporters' manufacturing activities in January.
The Chinese currency gained around 3.4 percent in January, its biggest monthly gain versus the dollar since 1994.
Overall, analysts say China is having some success in transforming its economy to a services-driven one, without dealing a huge blow to its manufacturing industry.
Growth in China's services industry picked up in January, a separate official PMI of the services sector showed on Wednesday.
In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in services, which accounts for over half of China's economy, expanded. 

Of note, the tech sector, while accounting for just 3 percent of gross domestic product, sustained its double-digit growth.

The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 54.8 in January, up from a preliminary reading of 54.4 and from a final 54.0 in December.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 17th consecutive month and reached its highest level since February 2014.
""New business opportunities increased at the sharpest rate in four years, supporting the quickest rise in output since February 2014,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Businesses appeared to derive confidence from the robust economic backdrop that official data has depicted, with optimism strengthening to a four-month high.""
The output component of the PMI index stood at 54.7, which is the same as the preliminary ready and up from 54.5 in the previous month to also reach a peak not seen since February 2014.
The employment reading was at its highest in 11 months, while the final index for output prices rose to 52.5, up from a preliminary 52.0 and up from 51.0 in December, the best level since October 2008.
The output prices sub-index suggests government data measuring consumer prices may start to accelerate, a welcome sign for the Bank of Japan in its quest to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.

Gross domestic product has expanded for the past seven quarters, the strongest run of growth since 1994. The output gap shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years. Stock prices are at their highest in 26 years, and corporate profits are near an all-time high.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 02:38PM ET</span>","U.S. private payrolls rise strongly, wage growth picking up","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private sector payrolls rose at a brisk pace in January as hiring increased across the board despite unseasonably cold weather, pointing to sustained labor market strength at the start of the year. 
The robust jobs market is gradually putting upward pressure on compensation, with other data on Wednesday showing a solid increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter. Tightening labor market conditions and signs of a pickup in wage growth are likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials who have long expressed concern about benign inflation.
In a statement at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials said they expected annual inflation to ""move up this year and to stabilize"" around the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged. U.S. financial markets expect a rate hike in March. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after lifting borrowing costs three times in 2017.
""It's a myth that wages are not going up so the Fed doves can stop thinking there is slack in the labor market,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We now expect the Fed can lift rates four times this year and not the three rate hikes they penciled-in in December."" 
The ADP national employment report showed private sector employment rose by 234,000 jobs in January, beating economists' expectations for an increase of only 185,000. December's payrolls count was revised down to 242,000 from 250,000. 
Manufacturing added 12,000 jobs last month and construction payrolls increased 9,000 despite bitterly cold temperatures in many parts of the country. There were also widespread job gains in the private services sector.
The ADP report is jointly produced with Moody's Analytics. It, however, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government' more comprehensive employment report. The Department of Labor will publish January's employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
STRONG START
""While we do not take the ADP employment report into our forecasting methodology for payrolls, the report nonetheless suggests job creation got off to a strong start in 2018,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies following the Fed's policy statement, while prices for U.S. Treasuries pared losses. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after two days of steep losses.
In a separate report the Labor Department said the Employment Cost Index (ECI), the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0.7 percent rise in the third quarter. 
That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.6 percent, the largest gain since the first quarter of 2015, from 2.5 percent in the third quarter.
Private sector wages and salaries rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. They were up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through December, the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2015, and followed a 2.6 percent gain in the third quarter.
Wage growth is expected to get a boost from the strong labor market, which is forecast to hit full employment this year. Economists expect the jobless rate to hit 3.5 percent by the end of 2018. 
A $1.5 trillion tax cut package pushed through by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December is also expected to bolster compensation growth. The tax cut has resulted in some companies either paying out one-time bonuses or raising wages for employees. 
Companies like  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) have announced they will use some of the savings from the tax cut to boost wages for workers. 
""Today's report is quite consistent with our view of gradually firming wage growth, which we expect to reach a sustainable pace around 2.5-3.0 percent in 2018,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""We expect one-time bonuses and minimum wage increases to provide a tailwind to the ECI to start the year.""
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. 
Benefits for all workers increased 0.5 percent in the October-December quarter after rising 0.8 percent in the third quarter. They were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months through December after rising 2.4 percent in the year to September. Healthcare benefits increased 1.1 percent in 12 months through December, the smallest gain since 1995.

A third report on Wednesday showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes increased 0.5 percent in December. These contracts become sales after a month or two and suggest moderate gains in home resales. Existing home sales have been constrained by tight supply, which is pushed up prices, making house purchases unaffordable for some first-time buyers.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.4 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.

Pending sales rose 0.5 percent in December from the same month in 2016. Pending home sales rose 4.0 percent in the South from a year earlier, while they were up 0.3 percent in the Midwest. Pending home sales fell 2.7 percent in the Northeast and 3.1 percent in the West on a year-on-year basis.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's months-long political deadlock contributed to weaker retail sales data in December, suppressing consumers' appetite for goods and services, the country's leading retail association said on Wednesday.
Germany has been without a government since an election in September that weakened Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. They are now in talks with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on renewing a coalition that governed Germany from 2013 to 2017.
""Consumers finally want to have a government,"" said Stefan Genth, secretary-general of the HDE retail association, after data showed retail sales had fallen by 1.9 percent both on the month and on the year in December.
The fall was also partly linked to December having had two fewer working days than in 2016. The retail sales readings of the highly volatile indicator for November were revised down. 
The data belied a consumption-based growth cycle in Europe's largest economy, fueled by rising real wages, record low unemployment and the cheap-money environment created by the European Central Bank (ECB).
Merkel's first attempt to form a three-way alliance with the ecologist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats collapsed suddenly in November, forcing her to turn to the SPD.
The economy has weathered the political crisis resulting from an inconclusive election on Sept. 24 that brought the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into parliament for the first time and made coalition building more difficult.
The German economy grew by 2.2 percent last year and the government on Wednesday raised it growth forecast for 2018 to 2.4 percent, citing consumption and a robust labor market as the backbone of the growth cycle.
""CAUTIOUS PEOPLE""
The HDE retail association said it expected sales to rise by 2 percent this year, lower than the 4.1 percent growth recorded last year.
""We are cautious people,"" HDE president Josef Sanktjohanser said of the forecast, adding that the December dip in sales was followed by a start to 2018 that was ""not so euphoric"".
But the bigger picture for consumption remains positive. Retail sales grew 2.3 percent in real terms last year on the whole, and a survey last week showed consumer morale rose heading into February, unperturbed by the political deadlock.
Separate data published on Wednesday showed that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in January, the lowest level since German reunification in 1990.
The economy has also benefited from rising exports, as demand from euro zone partners enjoying a solid recovery as well as from China and the United States increase demand for German goods and services.

The government expects exports to grow by 5.3 percent this year.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. labor costs increase solidly in the fourth quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased solidly in the fourth quarter and growth in compensation is expected to accelerate as a tightening labor market forces employers to raise wages to retain and attract workers. 
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.7 percent rise in the third quarter, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.6 percent, the largest increase since the first quarter of 2015, from 2.5 percent in the third quarter. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2017.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter after advancing 0.7 percent in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months through December. That followed a similar gain in the year to September.
Wage growth is expected to get a boost from a strong labor market, which is forecast to hit full employment this year. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and economists expect it to drop to 3.5 percent by the end of 2018. 
A $1.5 trillion tax cut package pushed through by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December is also expected to bolster compensation growth. The tax cut has resulted in some companies either paying out one-time bonuses or raising wages for employees. 
Companies like  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) have announced they will use some of the savings from the tax cut to boost wages for workers. 
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target. Labor costs increased 2.5 percent in the year to September.
Federal Reserve officials were scheduled to resume a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of the meeting. The Fed has forecast three rate hikes this year. It increased borrowing costs three times in 2017.
Private sector wages and salaries rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. They were up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through December, the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2015. That followed a 2.6 percent gain in the year to September.

Benefits for all workers increased 0.5 percent in the October-December quarter after rising 0.8 percent in the third quarter. They were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months through December after rising 2.4 percent in the year to September.

Inflation in the 19-country single currency area declined to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent in December, in line with market expectations. Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a month-on-month calculation.
The decline came because of a slower increase of unprocessed food and energy prices.

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and compared to a 1.4% advance in the prior month.
According to Eurostat, and looking at the main components of euro area inflation, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in January (2.1%, compared with 2.9% in December), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (1.9%, compared with 2.1% in December), services (1.2%, stable compared with December) and non-energy industrial goods (0.6%, compared with 0.5% in December).
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in January from the same period a year ago. That was also in line with forecasts and came after a 0.9% rise in December.
The European Central Bank’s inflation target is officially close to, but below, 2.0% and will make its next monetary policy decision on March 8.
Given strong growth in the euro area, markets are paying close attention to whether the ECB may announce an end to its asset purchase program, currently set to expire in Sepetember.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed more than expected in January to an 8-month low in the face of a cooling property market and tighter pollution rules that have curtailed factory output.
The data, which gives global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of 2018, reinforced the view that the economy is beginning to gradually lose steam after growing by a better-than-expected 6.9 percent last year.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Wednesday edged lower to 51.3 in January, compared with 51.6 in December. But it remained comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the headline number would ease slightly to 51.5.
Indexes for output, total new orders and imports all showed more moderate expansion in January compared with last month, while export orders fell marginally. The new export order index dropped to 49.5, 2.4 percentage point lower than December's reading. 
However, the overall factory reading still appeared relatively solid, marking the 19th straight month of expansion and reinforcing expectations that any slowdown in the economy would be gradual. Economists polled by Reuters are penciling in growth of 6.5 percent this year.[ECILT/CN] 
A separate PMI on the steel sector rose to 50.9 in January from 50.2 in December.
In another sign of broader economic resilience, a sister survey showed activity in China's service sector accelerated to a four-month high in January. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.3 from 55 in December.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.
A buoyant services industry is welcome news for the policymakers who are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.
TRADE RISKS
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturing and industrial firms were a major driver behind the solid economic growth last year.
But analysts say increasing trade frictions with the United States could cloud the outlook for exporters in the world's second-largest economy. 
U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels last week. China is the world's biggest solar panel producer.
The decisions were the first of several potential tariff actions that Trump may take in the coming weeks and months. He is also considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminum and other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices. 
A slowing property market is also likely to dent China's industrial activity this year, dampening demand for building materials from glass to steel. Property investment growth in December alone moderated to 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the lowest since July 2016.
Moreover, China is expected to continue a wide-ranging crackdown this year on riskier types of financing and debt. The campaign is slowly pushing up companies' borrowing costs and making it harder and more expensive for weaker firms to raise funds.
""Looking ahead, some of the recent weakness in manufacturing may be partially reversed in the coming months as disruptions caused by the anti-pollution campaign fade,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
""But any rebound is likely to prove short-lived given that the drags on economic activity from slower credit growth and the cooling property market are set to intensify this year.""
China also published a composite PMI for the first time on Wednesday, covering both manufacturing and services activity in a bid to better capture overall economic trends. 
The composite PMI stood at 54.6 in January, well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and unchanged for a third month.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>","Japan factory output rises, points to solid fourth-quarter GDP growth","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output grew in December at the fastest pace in eight months, and up for a third straight month, in a sign that its humming factories have likely driven economic expansion for an eighth consecutive quarter.
Trade ministry data out on Wednesday showed factory output grew 2.7 percent in December from the previous month, handily beating economists' median estimate of a 1.6 percent increase, following a 0.5 percent gain in November.
The gain was led by transport equipment, and general-purpose, production and business-oriented machinery.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to fall 4.3 percent in January and increase 5.7 percent in February.
Economists expect factory output to remain in a recovery trend in line with the robust global economy and a pickup in domestic demand, with the jobs market being the tightest in decades, barring risks from global politics and U.S. protectionism.
""As the global economy is gathering momentum, exports are rising, helping output stay in an uptrend,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""A gradual pickup in private consumption and solid capital spending should also support factory activity although it may slow temporarily in the export-slowing month of January.""
For October-December, factory output grew 1.8 percent from the previous three months, up for a seventh straight quarter, pointing to a solid growth in gross domestic product in the same quarter.
Japan's economy has been in its best shape in years over the past year, with gross domestic product expanding for the seventh straight quarter through last September.
The output gap - one of several factors the government watches in determining whether the economy is sustainably out of deflation - shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years, according to central bank data.
The Bank of Japan data out this month put the output gap - calculated by subtracting the economy's potential supply from actual demand - at plus 1.35 percent in the three months to September, the highest reading since the first quarter of 2008.
A positive output gap generally helps boost prices and should encourage Bank of Japan policymakers struggling to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target.
Inflation, however, has lagging a robust economic revival despite recent improvements in wages and consumer spending, leaving the central bank in a bind on when and how it should exit crisis-mode monetary stimulus.

The trade ministry on Wednesday stuck to its assessment of factory output, which it described as ""picking up"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's industrial production unexpectedly fell in December, failing to recover after barely expanding in November as car output contracted sharply, national statistics agency data showed on Wednesday. 
Factory output contracted by 6 percent in December from a year earlier, marking another sharp decline after a 6.3 percent drop in October, the biggest fall since 2013. 
The median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters was for output to rise 0.1 percent from November, and dip by 1.4 percent from a year earlier.
""Growth momentum from auto sector was weak in both November and December because of union strikes. Overall production growth is still led by the IT sector,"" Park Sang-hyun, chief economist, HI Investment & Securities.
Car production dropped 11.4 percent from a month earlier while output of machine tools fell 4 percent.
Park added the Bank of Korea will not be able to raise its policy interest rate in the first quarter given the uneven growth path, but ""may be able to make a move in the second quarter should exports and the global economy hold up"".
The BOK held its policy interest rate  steady in January after raising it for the first time in more than six years to 1.50 percent in November. The bank flagged concerns over economic uncertainties and soft inflation, which remain hurdles to policy tightening this year.
Thursday's data showed production of memory chips expanded 2.9 percent from a month earlier and the output of communications equipment surged 27.3 percent.
In annual terms, car production contracted by 25.2 percent, while output of electronic equipment grew 19.3 percent, the statement showed.

Robust consumer confidence and rising household wealth as a result of record gains on the U.S. stock market and rising house prices have left Americans less fearful about the future. That is encouraging some to dip into their savings to fund purchases.
""More confident U.S. consumers point to stronger spending as the year begins,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 2.3 points to a reading of 125.4 this month. 
But consumers were less upbeat in their assessment of current conditions. They were also ambivalent about their income prospects over the coming months, which the survey attributed to ""some uncertainty regarding the impact of the tax plan."" 
The Trump administration and the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress pushed through a $1.5 trillion tax cut package last month. While many Americans will see an increase in their paychecks, taxes will increase for some middle-income families.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, rose to a cycle high of 21.2 in January from 20.3 in December.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with further absorption of labor market slack. The labor market is near full employment, with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING
The report came as Federal Reserve officials began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of the meeting on Wednesday. Economists expect the Fed, which has forecast three rate increases this year, to raise its economic assessment.
The central bank raised borrowing costs three times last year. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose, putting pressure on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) falling more than 350 points. 
Strong consumer confidence bodes well for consumer spending, even though households' buying plans showed mixed intentions in January. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped a bit in January.
Consumer spending increased at its quickest pace in three years in the fourth quarter. Robust consumer confidence also provides a boost to the economy after it grew 2.3 percent in 2017. Households are drawing down savings to boost spending. The saving rate fell to a 10-year low of 3.4 percent in 2017.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of house prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 6.4 percent in November on a year-over-year basis after increasing 6.3 percent in October.
An acute shortage of homes on the market and strong demand are pushing up house prices. While rising house prices are boosting equity for homeowners, the dearth of properties is sidelining first-time buyers from the market, hurting home sales. The house price appreciation has outpaced wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent.
""Strong economic growth has boosted home buying but new construction has been slow to ramp up. The persistent supply-demand imbalance has driven prices higher across the country and worsened affordability concerns,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

""Home prices have risen about three times faster than inflation and twice as fast as income growth over the past year.""

The report is based on data from September 2017 and market intelligence as of December 2017.
""While house price growth has slowed, house price levels remained high relative to underlying economic fundamentals such as income and population growth. Therefore, we continue to find strong evidence of overvaluation,"" said Dana Senagama, CMHC's principal market analyst for Toronto.
While the housing market in Toronto, Canada's largest city, has shown some signs of slowing after repeated moves to tighten mortgage lending, analysts are divided about whether the market will rebound or see a sharp price correction.
The CMHC's quarterly report found strong evidence of overvaluation in Toronto, Vancouver, Hamilton and Victoria, and overheating was detected in Vancouver as demand for condos remained elevated and inventories were near record lows.

Evidence of overbuilding was also seen in Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Regina, though house prices were broadly in line with fundamentals, the report showed.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence increased to 125.4 this month from a reading of 123.1 (revised up from an initial 122.1) in December.
Analysts had expected the index to advance to just 123.1 in January.
The Present Situation Index decreased slightly, from 156.5 to 155.3, while the Expectations Index increased from 100.8 last month to 105.5 this month.
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was January 16.
Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, indicated that even though consumers’ assessment of current conditions decreased slightly, it remained at historically strong levels.
“Expectations improved, though consumers were somewhat ambivalent about their income prospects over the coming months, perhaps the result of some uncertainty regarding the impact of the tax plan,” she added.
“Overall, however, consumers remain quite confident that the solid pace of growth seen in late 2017 will continue into 2018,” Franco affirmed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's housing market lost momentum last month as lenders approved the fewest mortgages in nearly three years following the Bank of England's first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis.
At the same time, lending to consumers - something the BoE is watching closely - sped up for the first time in four months.
Britain's economy lagged behind stronger growth in much of the rest of the world last year as the rise in inflation triggered by June 2016's Brexit vote and weak wage growth ate into households' disposable income.
Tuesday's data showed the biggest rise in the interest rate on existing mortgages since 2010. That spells further weakness in the housing market during 2018 when the BoE is expected to raise interest rates again, economists said. 
""While the increase in interest rates in November was just 0.25 percent and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, there does appear to have been some impact on house buyers' psychology,"" said Howard Archer of economic consultants EY Item Club.
The BoE will signal next week whether it is likely to raise rates again in May or wait for clearer signs of what kind of trade deal Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to extract from the European Union.
A government report seen by Buzzfeed News on Monday showed Britain will be worse off under each of three broad scenarios for the country's future relations with the EU than if it stayed in the bloc.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 61,039, the lowest since January 2015, from 64,712 in November and below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a drop to 63,500.
But consumer lending increased by a stronger than expected 1.52 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) in December, pushing up the yearly growth rate to 9.5 percent from November's 9.3 percent. 
Consumer credit growth had been slowing gradually since it peaked at nearly 11 percent in November 2016.
Net mortgage lending also rose by a stronger than expected 3.68 billion pounds.
The BoE has said there is no British debt bubble but has told banks to set aside more money against the risk of bad loans.
After a Christmas holiday marked by tight spending by consumers, there were signs that households felt a bit more optimistic in early 2018, possibly encouraged by signs that inflation has peaked and wage growth might gather pace.
Consumer confidence rose at the fastest pace in a year in January, polling firm YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, said.
A separate survey published by the European Commission showed British consumer confidence in January was its strongest since March 2017.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",China's factory growth seen fading slightly in January,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector likely expanded at a slightly slower pace in January as the government's punishing war on air pollution and a cooling property market dampened activity, a Reuters poll showed.
But the pace of expansion is expected to remain relatively healthy, reinforcing analysts' views that the world's second-largest economy will see only a modest slowdown in growth this year after a forecast-beating 2017.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on Wednesday is expected to dip marginally to 51.5 for January from 51.6 in December, according to a median forecast of 42 economists polled by Reuters.
That would mark the 19th straight month of expansion for China's manufacturers, who are posting their strongest profits in six years thanks to a prolonged building boom and resurgent export demand. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. 
""We still think the overall economy is slowing, with growth in exports, retail sales and real estate investment all showing signs of fatigue,"" said Yang Zhao, chief China economist at Nomura.
China is also expected to continue a wide-ranging crackdown this year on riskier types of financing and debt. The campaign is slowly pushing up companies' borrowing costs and making it harder and more expensive for weaker firms to raise funds.
The vice central bank governor said this week the country may step up regulatory efforts by including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), which is used to help gauge the health of the country's banks.
A slowdown has already started to take hold in the manufacturing sector in the last few months.
Pollution restrictions have forced some ""smokestack"" industries to reduce output over the winter, while China's export and import growth slowed in December after surging in the previous month.
Economists polled by Reuters expected China's economic growth will moderate to around 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017.
""In the short term, we think the slowdown (in industrial activity) is still quite moderate, as what we have seen with rather gradual softening in real estate,"" Zhao said.
Economists expect a private survey on China's factory activity on Thursday will show a similar trend as the official reading, with activity in January expanding at slightly slower but still solid pace. 
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will be 51.3 in January versus 51.5 the previous month.
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from a year-long, state-led construction boom as large, government-owned industrial heavyweights.
The official PMI survey will be published on Jan. 31, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector.

The private Caixin PMI will be published on Feb. 1, with the Caixin services PMI to be released on Feb. 5.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 10:26PM ET</span>",Japan's robust labor demand bolsters outlook for wage increases,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Labor demand in Japan rose in December to its highest in more than 40 years, which could help workers pressing for bigger pay increases at annual wage negotiations and push stubbornly slow consumer price growth towards policymakers' inflation target.
The strong labor market data out on Tuesday suggests employers may be more likely to heed the government's call to raise wages by 3 percent or more at annual negotiations with unions - increasing the prospects for consumer spending and inflation to pick up.
""The labor market is tight, and companies are having trouble hiring workers, so this puts some upward pressure on wages,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Retail sales jumped a hefty 3.6 percent in December from a year earlier, handily topping a median market forecast for a 1.8 percent increase, and the biggest annual increase since the 4.9 percent seen in April 2015, when retail sales rebounded sharply after a sales tax increase the previous year. 
""It's fair to say consumer spending will remain in a gradual recovery trend,"" Miyazaki added.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio rose to 1.59 from 1.56 in November, which is more than the median forecast of 1.57 and the highest since January 1974.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged up to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in November, data from the Internal Affairs ministry showed. Economists' median forecast was for the jobless rate to remain at 2.7 percent, the lowest since November 1993.
The jobless rate rose slightly as some people voluntarily left jobs to find better work, an internal affairs ministry official said.
The labor participation rate for men was 83.2 percent, up 0.6 percentage point from a year earlier, while the labor participation rate for women was 68.2 percent, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago as government policies drew more women into the workforce.
In addition to the increase in female workers, Japan has also been recruiting foreign workers to ease labor shortages.
In October 2017 the number of foreign workers in Japan was 1.3 million, the highest on record, separate data from the labor ministry showed.
""One widely-overlooked factor driving Japan's growth in recent years has been a surge in the number of foreign workers,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics said in a research note.
""This appears to be continuing as employers face labor shortages and recent legal changes have made it easier for foreigners to work in the country.""
To be sure, there is still some reason to be cautious about how much wages will rise. Two-thirds of Japanese firms think the government's push to raise wages by 3 percent is a tall order, with some dismissing it out of hand, a Reuters survey last month showed.
Japan's Keidanren business lobby has thrown its considerable weight behind the government's push for big cash-rich companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more this year.
Some companies have little choice but to raise wages as they battle to secure workers in the face of the labor shortage, economists say.
Japan logged seven straight quarters of economic expansion to end-September, its longest uninterrupted stretch of growth since 1994. Exports have been robust, corporate profits are near record highs, and Tokyo stocks are at their highest in 26 years.
The improving economic outlook has increased expectations that Japan's consumer prices will start rising more quickly, making it easier for the Bank of Japan to meet its 2 percent inflation target.
Japanese household spending, which is different from retail sales because it is based on surveys sent to a small sample of consumers, fell 0.1 percent in December from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms.

This is counter to economists' median estimate of a 1.7 percent annual increase, but an unusually large 23.3 percent annual decline in spending on home repairs pulled down household spending in December.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:18AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending rises; savings drop to 10-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in December as demand for goods and services increased, but the gain came at the expense of savings, which dropped to a 10-year low in a troubling sign for future consumption and economic growth.
Rising household wealth due to record gains on the U.S. stock market as well as higher home prices likely made Americans more confident to dip into their savings to fund purchases, economists said. Savings are now at levels last seen in December 2007, when the economy slipped into recession.
""It is true that the gains in consumer confidence as well as in the stock market and housing wealth are making Americans feel much better today than they were previously,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""That said, the U.S. consumer will need to see continuous growth in income over the year in order to be able to continue to keep up the current pace of consumption.""
The Commerce Department said on Monday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.8 percent increase in November.
Last month's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Spending was previously reported to have risen 0.6 percent in November. 
Savings fell to $351.6 billion in December from $365.1 billion in the prior month. Savings declined to $485.8 billion in 2017, the lowest level since 2007, from $680.6 billion in 2016.
The saving rate dropped to 2.4 percent, the lowest level since September 2005, from 2.5 percent in November. It decreased to 3.4 percent in 2017, a 10-year low, from 4.9 percent in 2016.
""The continued drawdown in the (saving) rate will likely limit the extent to which consumption can continue to accelerate, all else equal,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
The impact of low savings on consumer spending could, however, be temporarily offset by income tax cuts which went into effect in January. 
MODERATE INCOME GROWTH
Last month, personal income rose 0.4 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in November. Income grew 3.1 percent in 2017, a pickup from the 2.4 percent rise in 2016. The data were included in the advance fourth-quarter gross domestic product report published on Friday. 
Consumer spending accelerated at a 3.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest in three years, after rising at a 2.2 percent pace in the third quarter.
Robust consumer spending helped to offset the drag from trade and inventories on the economy, which grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter. GDP increased at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter.
In the wake of the strong GDP report, some economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise its economic assessment when it concludes a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. 
That could increase the probability that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates four times this year. The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for this year.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower after the data, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to its highest level since April 2014. That helped to lift the dollar (DXY) against a basket of currencies. 
Stocks on Wall Street eased from record levels last week, weighed down by a drop in Apple (O:AAPL) shares after a report said the company will halve its iPhone X production target for the first quarter to around 20 million units.
Last month, spending on long-lasting goods, such as motor vehicles, increased 0.7 percent. Outlays on services rose 0.5 percent, reflecting rising demand for utilities.
While monthly inflation ticked up in December, price pressures remained benign. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in December after a 0.1 percent gain in November.
The so-called core PCE increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through December after a similar rise in the 12 months through November. The core PCE has missed the Fed's 2 percent target since mid-2012.

""We believe inflation will firm in 2018, supported by a positive output gap, rising energy prices and a weaker U.S. dollar,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Saudi foreign reserves rise for third straight month,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi Arabian central bank's foreign reserves rose in December for a third consecutive month, a sign that higher oil prices may be easing pressure on the government's finances, official data showed on Sunday.
The bank's net foreign assets grew $2.0 billion from November to $488.9 billion last month, after increasing $1.0 billion in November and $8.3 billion in October. It was the first time since mid-2014 that the reserves have risen for three straight months.
The government has been using the reserves, which peaked at $737 billion in August 2014, to cover a big budget deficit caused by low oil export receipts.
The central bank did not explain the reasons for the December data, but a jump in oil prices to three-year highs has lifted revenues, and this may have reduced the need for the government to draw down the reserves - though not entirely removed it, as Riyadh is still running a deficit.
Other factors may also be responsible for the rise in reserves, such as changes in the pattern of transfers of money to Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, and weakness of the U.S. dollar, which boosts the non-dollar portion of the assets.
Also, the government launched a massive crackdown on corruption in November, saying it aimed to recover $100 billion of illicit funds in financial settlements with suspects. Some money from settlements may have bolstered the reserves.
The foreign assets, the vast majority of which are believed to be in U.S. dollars, are held mostly in the form of securities holdings and bank deposits. Securities holdings rose in December while deposits edged down.

Sunday's data also showed outstanding bank loans to the private sector shrank 0.8 percent from a year earlier in December, the 10th straight month of falling bank lending.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>",Robust imports slow U.S. economic growth in fourth quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years resulted in a surge in imports.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared to 3.2 percent in the third quarter, restrained by a widening trade deficit and only modest inventory accumulation, the Commerce Department said on Friday. 
President Donald Trump's goal is for U.S. economic growth of 3.0 percent annually and the Republican-controlled Congress in December pushed through a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts in the largest overhaul of the tax code in 30 years in an attempt to boost growth. 
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, an acceleration from the 1.5 percent logged in 2016. 
Imports, which subtract from GDP growth, increased at their fastest rate in more than seven years. Rising imports underscore the challenges that the Trump administration faces in its quest to boost annual GDP growth to 3.0 percent. They indicate that U.S. companies lack the capacity to meet buoyant domestic demand.
""Domestic demand is strong, really strong, and perhaps beginning to push against the capacity constraints of the economy,"" said Paul Mortimer-Lee, chief market economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York. ""And this precedes effects from tax cuts.""
A measure of domestic demand expanded at its quickest since the third quarter of 2014, highlighting the economy's strength.
Strong domestic demand is part of a synchronized global rebound that includes the euro zone and Asia. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy growing at a 3.0 percent pace in the final three months of 2017.
They expect annual GDP growth will hit the government's 3.0 percent target this year, spurred in part by the tax cuts, a weak U.S. dollar, rising oil prices and a strengthening global economy.
Growth, economists believe, will slow in 2019, with a recession likely in 2020, given low savings.
""Once the temporary boost from the tax cuts has faded, households' disposable income gains won't be strong enough to sustain similarly large increases in consumer spending that we have seen over the past several years,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
""And with the savings rate close to a record-low, the ammunition from that side has gotten limited as well.""
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower after the GDP report. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) hitting a record high.
HOT CONSUMER SPENDING
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. That was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. It followed a 2.2 percent rate of growth in the July-September quarter.
The surge, however, came at the expense of savings, which fell to $384.4 billion from $478.3 billion in the third quarter. The saving rate dropped to 2.6 percent from 3.3 percent in the prior period.
Companies failed to produce enough to meet demand last quarter, boosting imports, which grew at a 13.9 percent pace. That was fastest pace since the third quarter of 2010 and offset a rise in exports, which is being driven by dollar weakness. 
International trade sliced off 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter, the most in a year, after adding 0.36 percentage point in the third quarter. 
""The capacity to meet sharply rising demand is just not there,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland Pennsylvania.
""Yes, industrial production should strengthen, but we will also have to get a lot of the rising demand from the rest of the world. So, expect imports to grow rapidly and the trade deficit to widen.""  
Robust consumer spending also limited the accumulation of inventories, which subtracted 0.67 percentage point from GDP growth after adding 0.79 percentage point in the prior period.
The acceleration in consumer spending raised inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.9 percent rate. That was the quickest pace in more than a year and followed a 1.3 percent pace of increase in the third quarter.
Signs of rising inflation together with a tightening labor market could put the Fed on a more aggressive path of interest rate increases than is currently being anticipated, economists say. The unemployment rate dropped seven-tenths of percentage point last year to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
The U.S. central bank has forecast three interest rate hikes this year, the same number as in 2017. 
Business investment in equipment grew at its quickest pace since the third quarter of 2014. While spending on equipment is likely to be underpinned in 2018 by the corporate income tax cuts and rising crude oil prices, there are signs that the momentum is slowing.
A second report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell in December for the first time in six months.

Investment in homebuilding rebounded after contracting for two straight quarters. Government spending notched its fastest pace since the second quarter of 2015.

720,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","U.S. GDP Grows Below-Forecast 2.6% on Trade, Inventory Drags","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy expanded at a slower-than-projected pace in the fourth quarter on drags from trade and inventories, offsetting strength in consumer spending and business investment that signals solid momentum entering 2018.
Gross domestic product rose at a 2.6 percent annualized rate after 3.2 percent in the prior period, Commerce Department data showed Friday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 3 percent. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose 3.8 percent, the best in more than a year. Business equipment investment grew at the fastest pace in three years.
While the report dashed expectations for the longest streak of 3 percent-or-better growth since 2005, a key measure of underlying demand delivered the strongest performance since 2014 and inflation picked up, which will help keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in coming months.
President Donald Trump’s move to cut taxes may give the economy an additional boost in 2018, though reaching his goal of sustained 3 percent GDP growth will prove challenging, in part because household purchases are projected to cool. Weak productivity and slow labor-force expansion will also pose hurdles in the longer term, and higher borrowing costs could crimp gains as well.
“The economy continues to hum along,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, who accurately projected the 2.6 percent figure. “This is far from doom and gloom. Businesses are investing aggressively and consumers continue to spend at a very strong pace. We got a bit spoiled by 3 percent-plus growth in the last couple of quarters, but that streak was eventually going to come to an end.”
Fourth-quarter GDP was dragged down mainly because the trade deficit widened, as imports rose at double the pace of exports. Net exports subtracted 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth, the most in a year. A change in inventories subtracted 0.67 percentage point, the most since early 2017. A separate report on Friday showed that the nation’s merchandise-trade gap widened in December to the biggest since 2008.
Underlying Demand
For a better sense of underlying domestic demand, economists look at final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out inventories and trade, the two most volatile components of GDP. Such sales grew 4.3 percent last quarter, the most since 2014, after a 1.9 percent increase.
For the full year, GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, grew 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the Commerce Department report also showed. On that basis, it was the strongest annual performance since 2014’s 2.7 percent. The expansion is now in its ninth year and is poised to become the country’s second-longest on record later in 2018.
Fourth-quarter GDP growth forecasts ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.8 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey. Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, were projected to rise 3.7 percent, according to the survey median. The latest gain in consumer spending added 2.58 percentage points to growth.
Another standout was corporate demand. Business equipment investment expanded at a 11.4 percent annualized rate after a 10.8 percent gain in the prior period. That added 0.62 percentage point to fourth-quarter growth.
The economy also got a boost from housing for the first time in three quarters. Residential construction increased at a 11.6 percent annualized rate, contributing 0.42 percentage-point to growth.
While the boost from tax cuts and a strong labor market may provide support to the economy, growth may be less robust. GDP gains are projected to cool to 2.5 percent as early as this quarter, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
One reason is that household spending will be hard pressed to accelerate further. Wage gains remain tepid even with steady hiring and the lowest unemployment rate since 2000. Gasoline expenses are ticking up, consumer debt is rising, and borrowing costs are projected to keep rising gradually as the Fed tightens monetary policy.
First-quarter GDP has also been limited in recent years by so-called residual seasonality, or quirks in the data that the government is trying to address.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate dipped as expected in December as gasoline prices cooled, but analysts said the Bank of Canada was likely to stay on a policy-tightening path with inflation still near the central bank's 2 percent target.
The annual inflation rate was 1.9 percent last month, Statistics Canada said on Friday, down from 2.1 percent in November and matching economists' forecasts. 
Underlying inflation continued to perk up, with two out of three of the central bank's measures of core inflation higher. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, increased to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.
Analysts said the report was unlikely to change much for the Bank of Canada, which raised interest rates last week for the third time in seven months as job growth and firmer inflation outweighed uncertainty over the NAFTA trade deal.
Still, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said earlier this week that even he did not know what potential there may be for further interest rate hikes this year, reiterating that policymakers remained data dependent.
""For a data dependent central bank, this supports staying on a hike path,"" said Derek Holt, vice president and head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, pointing to the firmer core inflation.
Analysts in a Reuters poll predicted two more increases this year. [CA/POLL]
Rounding out the core inflation gauges, CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.9 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rose to 1.9 percent.
The Canadian dollar saw little initial reaction to the data and was trading firmer against the greenback. [CAD/] 
Markets odds of another hike in March were similarly little changed at 23 percent. Another hike is fully priced by May.
Food prices rose 2 percent from a year earlier as consumers paid more for food purchased at stores, particularly fresh vegetables.
The cost of gasoline moderated, with prices up 12.2 percent after the previous month's annual 19.6 percent surge. 
The household operations segment also weighed on inflation, down 0.3 percent due to a drop in the cost of telephone services as major telecom carriers offered temporary promotions.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",UK economy unexpectedly picks up speed but Brexit effect felt,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy unexpectedly picked up speed in the last three months of 2017, according to data which showed that the prospect of Brexit was still weighing on the economy, but not as heavily as once feared by investors.
Gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace of 2017, rising by 0.5 percent from the third quarter and beating the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists that growth would remain at 0.4 percent.
But the Office for National Statistics said the big picture was one of a slower and more uneven expansion in the world's sixth-biggest economy as it approaches its departure from the European Union in March next year.
In 2017 as a whole, growth was 1.8 percent compared with 1.9 percent in 2016, the slowest since 2012. For comparison, the International Monetary Fund expects growth of 2.4 percent in the euro zone last year. 
Investors took the data as a sign that the Bank of England might move more quickly towards only its second interest rate hike in more than a decade. 
Sterling added to its recent strong rise against the U.S. dollar and climbed against the euro. [GBP/]
The Bank of England said last month it expected the economy might have slowed slightly in late 2017. 
""If the UK economy does indeed struggle to move up a gear over coming months, the Bank will likely have to tread carefully when deciding whether to raise rates again this year,"" James Smith, an economist with ING, said.
""We don't expect any change in policy from the BoE in February, but a rate hike at the May meeting is an increasingly close call.""
The BoE's rate-setters are due to announce their next decision on borrowing costs on Feb. 8.
They raised rates for the first time since 2007 in November. Most economists have said they expect the next rate hike in late 2018 but some think it could come as soon as May.
Britain's economy grew more weakly than other big rich nations for much of last year as the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote pushed up inflation and many businesses turned cautious ahead of Brexit.
However, Britain has been helped by the recovery in the world economy last year which is expected to carry on in 2018.
Finance minister Philip Hammond described the figures as excellence, underscoring the resilience of the economy.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Friday Britain could start to grow more quickly later this year, if there is clarity about its future relationship with the EU. 
CONSUMERS SQUEEZED
While recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management firms helped boost growth, companies which relied on spending by consumers had a much slower fourth quarter.
Manufacturers, who have prospered from demand spurred by the recovery in the global economy, also grew strongly.
Separate data published on Friday showed personal insolvencies hit a three-year high, reflecting the financial strain on many households. 
Given the strength of global growth, Britain's would have grown by about 2.5 percent in 2017 were it not for the Brexit vote, Kallum Pickering, an economist with Berenberg, said. 
Compared with the same period in 2016, growth between October and December slowed to 1.5 percent, its weakest pace since the first quarter of 2013 and down from growth of 1.7 percent in the third quarter.
The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 1.4 percent.
Friday's data showed Britain's dominant services sector grew by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, gaining pace after growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, the ONS said. 
In November alone, services output growth was the strongest since August 2016, jumping by 0.4 percent from October. The ONS said it was expecting no monthly growth in services in December given the scale of November's increase. 
Industrial output slowed to show growth of 0.6 percent from 1.3 percent in the third quarter after the Forties oil pipeline, Britain's biggest, was closed for more than two weeks in December after the discovery of a crack.

Britain's construction sector shrank by 1.0 percent, its worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012.

China created a ""record-high"" 13.51 million new jobs in 2017, a growth of 370,000 compared with the previous year, according to an official transcript of a press briefing held by the ministry published online.
Lu Aihong, a spokesperson at the ministry, said employment prospects would become more ""complicated"" in 2018 due to ""still abundant"" economic uncertainties both at home and abroad, but he was hopeful the labor market would remain stable overall.
A record 8.2 million college graduates will enter the workforce in 2018, Lu said, while millions of rural residents are expected to move to urban areas for work, further adding pressure to the tight labor market.
Still, a ""structural conflict"" between low-skill labor supply and high-end job demand has become increasingly acute, Lu said.
China reallocated a total of 380,000 people in 2017 from heavy industries such as steel and coal under a government-led campaign to cut excess capacity, the ministry said.
China's official unemployment rate has remained generally stable despite slowing economic growth and the government forging ahead with plans to cut back industrial capacity.
Many analysts say, however, that the official data is an unreliable indicator of employment conditions, as it measures only employment in urban areas and doesn't take into account the millions of migrant workers that form the bedrock of China's labor force.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 10:56AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales post largest drop in 16 months; jobless claims up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell more than expected in December, recording their biggest drop in nearly 1-1/2 years, likely as the boost from the replacement of flood-damaged houses in parts of the South affected by hurricanes faded.
Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose from a 45-year low last week. The jump in jobless claims was, however, less than expected, and the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market that is helping to underpin demand for housing.
""We expect demand for single-family housing to remain robust, driven by job gains and the aging of the millennial generation into prime homebuying ages,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The Commerce Department said new home sales declined 9.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 units last month. The percentage decrease was the largest since August 2016. Unseasonably cold temperatures at the end of December probably also hurt sales.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that new home sales, which account for 10.1 percent of the housing market, would tumble 7.9 percent to a pace of 679,000 units last month.
Sales plunged 9.8 percent in the South last month after a 6.6 percent surge in November that was tied to rebuilding after the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. They fell 10 percent in the Midwest and dropped 2.4 percent in the Northeast - both regions experienced unusually cold weather in late December. In the West, sales fell 9.5 percent.
Pointing to underlying strength in the housing market, new home sales surged 14.1 percent from a year ago. They increased 8.3 percent in 2017 to 608,000 units, the highest level since 2007. 
The strong labor market, which is near full employment, has unleashed demand for housing that has not been matched by supply. As a result, house price inflation has outpaced wage growth, keeping some first-time home buyers out of the market. The median new house price rose 2.6 percent to a record $335,400 in December from a year ago.
While the stock of new homes on the market increased 3.9 percent in December to 295,000 units, more than an 8-1/2-year high, it remained below its peak of 572,000 units in July 2006.
At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in November. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
The U.S. dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading mostly lower while U.S. stock indexes were largely flat.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Jan. 20. Claims fell to 216,000 in the prior week, the lowest level since January 1973.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 240,000 in the latest week. Last week marked the 151st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""The song remains the same for tightness of the labor market - employers are extremely reluctant to fire current workers, which reflects not only the current positive business environment but also the difficulty in finding qualified replacements,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,500 to 240,000. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 28,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended Jan. 13. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,500 to 1.92 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which January's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims slipped 1,750 between the December and January survey periods. 
That suggests little change in the unemployment rate this month. The jobless rate dropped seven-tenths of a percentage point to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in 2017, and economists expect it to hit 3.5 percent by the end of this year, which could spur faster wage growth as companies compete for workers.
Strong wage inflation would in turn likely prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates a bit more aggressively than currently anticipated. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes this year. It increased borrowing costs three times in 2017.

""The Fed may have to pick up its game this year and raise rates four times, not just the three they have already forecast,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

November's sales pace was revised down to 689,000 units, still the strongest performance since July 2007, from the previously reported 733,000 units.

New home sales, which are drawn from permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales plunged 9.8 percent in the South last month after jumping 6.6 percent in November amid reconstruction efforts following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Sales fell 10 percent in the Midwest last month. 
New home sales surged 14.1 percent from a year ago. They increased 8.3 percent in 2017 to 608,000 units. 
A strong labor market, which is near full employment, has unleashed demand for housing that has not been matched with an increase in supply. As a result, house price inflation has outpaced wage growth, pricing some first-time home buyers out of the market. 
A report on Wednesday showed sales of previously owned homes declined 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units last month as inventory of houses dropped to a record low.
In December, there were 295,000 new homes on the market, an increase of 3.9 percent and the highest level since April 2009. The stock of new home sales still remains well below its peak during the housing market bubble. At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in November. 

A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",German business morale jumps back to match historic high,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence rose unexpectedly in January to match November's record high, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting that Europe's biggest economy continued to fire on all cylinders at the beginning of 2018 despite a stronger euro.
The surprisingly bullish figures, released by the Ifo economic institute, bode well for future growth and give Chancellor Angela Merkel a tailwind as she tries to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 117.6 in January from 117.2 in December.
The January reading beat expectations in a Reuters consensus forecast of analysts who had forecast a dip to 117.1.
""The German economy made a dynamic start to the year,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
The overall improvement was driven by managers taking a stronger view of their current business situation, with the respective sub-index hitting a record high, the survey showed.
Business expectations for the next six months were slightly scaled back, while remaining at an overall high level. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analyst Andreas Rees attributed the drop to the higher oil price and the stronger euro exchange rate, which makes exports to countries outside the single currency bloc more expensive.
A sector breakdown of the Ifo figures showed the main support came from manufacturing -- where the mood among managers hit a record high -- and wholesaling, while sentiment deteriorated in construction and retailing.
""Back to historic high, the euphoric hype of superlatives continues,"" said Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe.
""It's interesting to see that the political impasse regarding the formation of a government is apparently perceived by companies as hardly disturbing,"" Krueger added.
The Ifo figures chimed with data released earlier on Thursday that showed German consumer morale rose heading into February to its highest level since 2001, lifted by shoppers' perceptions of a boom in Europe's largest economy.
Household spending has become the main source of economic expansion in Germany as consumers benefit from record-high employment, increased job security, rising real wages and low borrowing costs.
The consumer-led upswing has been reinforced by a rebound in exports, propelling German economic growth to a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent in 2017. For this year, the Ifo institute expects an economic expansion of 2.6 percent.
But GfK economist Rolf Buerkl warned that Germany was still facing risks from abroad. ""In particular, the U.S. trade policy with its protectionist tendencies and the sluggish progress made in the Brexit negotiations could depress the consumer climate as the year unfolds,"" he said. 
In another positive sign for more growth to come, a survey among purchasing managers showed on Wednesday that Germany's private sector continued to grow robustly in January, propelled by both factories and services activity.
""For the next government, the tailwind could hardly be better to put Germany on a stable foundation in the long term,"" KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said, adding more investments were needed, especially in education and digitization.

""France and the other partners are ready to develop the EU -- this is a huge opportunity for our strong export-oriented country,"" Zeuner said.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 09:19PM ET</span>","South Korea economy contracts in fourth-quarter on export slump, autumn holiday","By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy unexpectedly shrank in the last quarter as struggling car exporters and industrial production failed to keep up the previous quarter's dashing pace, posting its worst performance since 2008.
An 10-day Chuseok autumn holiday in October hit fourth-quarter industrial output, just as a slump in car exports erased the gains from booming overseas sales of computer memory chips.
Hyundai Motor and its Kia Motors affiliate said earlier this month 2017 shipments were a million vehicles below their 8.25 million target after struggling with competitiveness problems and trade issues. 
The Bank of Korea said on Thursday that gross domestic product fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, sliding from bumper growth of 1.5 percent in the third quarter, which was the fastest expansion in seven years.
""There is a strong base effect after particularly high third quarter growth and as irregular factors such as the Chuseok holiday shortened the number of working days for businesses,"" said Chung Kyu-il, director general at the bank's Economic Statistics Department said at a news conference. 
Thursday's data reinforced a broad consensus that the central bank's monetary tightening will be gradual this year as export- and investment-led growth moderates after rapid expansion in 2017. 
The contraction in fourth-quarter 2017 undershot the 0.1 percent expansion seen by economists and marks the worst quarterly performance since the economy contracted by 3.3 percent on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Exports fell by 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter after leaping 6.1 percent a quarter earlier, while private consumption growth accelerated to 1.0 percent from 0.8 percent, the BOK said in a statement.
The economy expanded 3.0 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 3.8 percent growth in the September quarter.
Chung added that on a half-year basis, the July-December period showed faster growth versus January-June 2017, indicating an overall improvement in growth momentum. 
Moon Jung-hui, an economist at KB Investment & Securities said domestic demand will make up for slowing exports growth this year. 
""The burst of investment and exports we've seen in 2017 won't be sustained this year and will slow down. As the GDP data shows, the good news is that private consumption is picking up, and will support growth this year,"" said Moon.
Construction investment fell 3.8 percent from a quarter earlier after the government said in October it would impose additional mortgage curbs on owners of multiple homes to discourage excessive borrowing. 
The bank is monitoring the effects of its November hike, the first tightening in six years, and remains wary of triggering disruptive capital flows. 

The BOK held its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.50 percent on Jan. 18 and upgraded its 2018 growth forecast to 3 percent, a fraction higher than the 2.9 percent projected in October last year. It lowered its 2018 consumer inflation forecast to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent, supporting analysts' views that monetary policy will remain accommodative in 2018.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales fall as record-low inventory boosts prices,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell more than expected in December as the supply of houses on the market dropped to a record low, pushing up prices and sidelining some potential first-time buyers.
The decline in home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday followed three straight months of strong increases. Inventory constraints dogged the housing market last year against the backdrop of robust demand, largely driven by a labor market that is near full employment.
Economists expected supply to remain tight this year, which together with rising mortgage rates could result in modest home sales growth in 2018.
""We expect little growth in sales in 2018, given tight inventories,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Affordability will be crimped by rising mortgage rates, posing an additional headwind to sales.""
Existing home sales declined 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units last month amid decreases in all four regions. Unseasonably cold weather probably accounted for some of the weakness as sales in the Northeast and Midwest fell sharply.
November's sales pace was revised down to 5.78 million units, still the highest level since February 2007. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home sales falling 2.2 percent to a 5.70 million-unit rate in December from a previously reported 5.81 million-unit pace in November.
Existing home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, rose 1.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in December. They increased 1.1 percent to 5.51 million units in 2017, the most since 2006.
The number of previously owned homes on the market tumbled 11.4 percent to 1.48 million units in December, the lowest since January 1999 when the Realtors group started tracking the series. Supply has been tight at the lower end of the market.
Housing inventory was down 10.3 percent from a year ago. It has declined for 31 straight months on a year-on-year basis. At December's sales pace, it would take a record-low 3.2 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.5 months in November.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Supply could improve in the coming months as data last week showed permits approved for the construction of single-family homes increased in December to their highest level since August 2007, while the number of such dwellings under construction was the most in 9-1/2 years.
""New construction has showed signs of perking up, but remains well below estimates of demand,"" said Aaron Terrazas, as senior economist at Zillow. ""More importantly, builders face rising labor, materials and land costs making it difficult to build at a price point attractive to entry-level buyers."" 
The median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $246,800 in December. That was the 70th straight month of year-on-year price gains. House prices increased 5.8 percent in 2017, rising for the sixth straight year.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) initially rose following the data, but gave up gains to trade marginally lower. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
The dollar fell to a three-year low against a basket of major currencies after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the weaker greenback was positive for American trade. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy a home surging last week to their highest level since April 2010. Economists, however, worry that rising mortgage rates and caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code will slow demand for houses this year. 
First-time buyers accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month, up from 29 percent in November, but unchanged from a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.
""A shortage of affordable homes for sale will frustrate the ambitions of many first-time buyers, who will be forced to stay in the rental market for longer than planned,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.
House price increases have outpaced wage growth, which has struggled to break above 2.9 percent since the 2007/09 recession ended. In December, houses typically stayed on the market for 40 days, unchanged from November and down from 52 days a year ago.

Forty-four percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.

The industry data showed that home resales decreased by 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted 5.57 million units from 5.78 million units in the previous month which was revised down from an initial 5.81 million.
The consensus forecast was for a 2.2% decline to 5.72 million units in decline.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
Despite the disappointing end to 2017, NAR highlighted that sales had still risen by 1.1% on an annualized basis and last year was the best year for sales in 11 years.
However, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that the details were “far from perfect” as new listing struggled to keep up with the quick pace of sales while buying became less affordable in a large portion of the U.S.
“These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace,” he said.
The report also showed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $246,800, up 5.8% from December 2016 ($233,300). December’s price increase marks the 70th straight month of year-over-year gains.
“Rising wages and the expanding economy should lay the foundation for 2018 being the turning point towards an uptick in sales to first-time buyers,” Yun commented.
“However, if inventory conditions fail to improve, higher mortgage rates and prices will further eat into affordability and prevent many renters from becoming homeowners,” he warned.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.2398 compared to 1.2393 before the release, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.4214, compared to 1.4215 before the data, while USD/JPY traded at 109.20 compared to 109.21 earlier.

Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,353.80 a troy ounce, compared to $1,354.90 ahead of the data, while U.S. crude oil changed hands at $64.61, compared to $64.62 earlier.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to to 53.8 in January, from the prior reading of 54.1.
Consensus had been looking for a drop to 53.5.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
By sectors, the research group said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) unexpectedly dropped to 53.3 in January, from the prior month’s reading of 53.7.
Analysts had expected the reading to rise to 54.5.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Furthermore, IHS Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.5 in January from the prior month’s final reading of 55.1.
Economists had estimated that it would rise to just 55.2.
“January data indicated another solid expansion of U.S. private sector business activity, underpinned by the fastest rise in new work for five months,” IHS Markit highlighted.
“Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
“Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year,” he added.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that
together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, edged down to 58.8.
This was slightly below December's reading of 58.9, which was the highest in more than 6-1/2 years, but it beat the consensus forecast of 58.6. The reading was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the 57th month.
""The highlight of the latest results came from the service sector, where growth of business activity was the strongest seen for nearly seven years,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The flash PMI for services jumped to 57.0 in January from 55.8 in the previous month, with business expectations reaching a level last seen in early 2011.
The flash reading for the manufacturing sector fell to 61.2 from December's record 63.3 but still indicated one of the best growth performances in Germany's goods-producing sector in more than two decades.
The figures showed rising inflationary pressures, with the biggest jump in nearly seven years in average prices charged for both goods and services, suggesting that businesses were able to pass on some of their growing costs to customers.
Smith said purchasing managers were undeterred by continued political uncertainty in Germany, where a government has yet to be formed following elections in September, and rising cost pressures, showing strong optimism about the outlook for 2018.
IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said the survey data suggested the German economy would grow by more than 1 percent on the quarter in the first three months of 2018.
The survey chimed with figures released earlier this month that showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent last year, the strongest since 2011. OLUSECON Reuters US Online Report Economy 20180124T113455+0000"
740,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","UK employment surges to unexpected record high, wages edge up","LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The number of people in work in Britain surged unexpectedly in the three months to November and regular wages rose at their fastest rate in almost a year, official data showed on Wednesday.
Britain's economy slowed in 2017 as higher inflation - caused by the post-Brexit referendum fall in the pound - hurt the spending power of consumers, although forecasts of a bigger hit to growth were confounded and job creation was strong.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the three months to November, the biggest increase since the period to July and taking total employment to a record 32.2 million. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a fall of 13,000.
The ONS said workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by an annual 2.4 percent in the three months to November, the biggest increase since December 2016 and compared with 2.3 percent in the three months to October.
Total pay growth, including bonuses, was unchanged at 2.5 percent, as expected.
The Bank of England increased interest rates for the first time since 2007 in November as most of its policymakers thought the steep fall in unemployment would soon start to push up wages.
""With the employment rate returning to a joint-record high and the number of vacancies setting a new record, demand for workers clearly remained strong,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.
""Nevertheless inflation remains higher than pay growth and so the real value of earnings continues to decline.""
Consumer price inflation for November hit it highest in almost six years at 3.1 percent. That left regular pay in real-terms down 0.5 percent on a year earlier in the three months to November.
The data also showed the unemployment rate held at its four-decade low of 4.3 percent, as expected in the Reuters poll.
The number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 8,600 to 832,500 in December, lifting the proportion of the workforce claiming jobless benefits to 2.4 percent, the highest rate since February 2015.
Economists taking part in the Reuters poll had expected the number of benefit claimants - which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn - to rise by 5,400.

The ONS said this measure was potentially misleading as it had been affected by changes in benefit eligibility.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment held steady at 4.3% in November, matching consensus expectations.
The claimant count increased by a seasonally adjusted 8,600 in December, worse than expectations for a gain of 5,400 people and following a rise of 12,200 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 5,900 increase.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.5% in the three months to November, in line with forecasts and the prior month’s reading.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.4% in the three months to November, compared to expectations for it match the prior month’s reading of a 2.3% gain.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
An acceleration of service sector growth to the fastest since August 2007 was partly countered by a slowdown in manufacturing output growth, though the latter remained very buoyant. The latest three months have seen the strongest factory output increase since 2000.
Activity was buoyed by a further marked and broad-based increase in new business.
Companies also grew more optimistic about the outlook for the year ahead in January, with business expectations reviving to an eight-month high.
Amid strong growth of new orders and improved confidence about the outlook, companies expanded their workforce numbers to the greatest extent since September 2000.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, “The acceleration of growth pushes the survey data into territory consistent with the economy expanding at a super-strong quarterly rate approaching 1%.""
""With such a strong start to the year, expect to see forecasters mark up their expectations of eurozone growth and inflation in 2018, and for policymakers to sound more hawkish,” he added.

Germany’s economy maintained strong growth momentum at the start of 2018 thanks to the fastest rise in service sector business activity for nearly seven years.
Growth in the manufacturing sector was meanwhile below the record level seen at the end of 2017 but still among the highest seen over the past two decades.
Job creation in the private sector economy meanwhile gathered pace to reach the fastest seen since early-2011.

The targets for the two wealthy mega-cities are in line with the national goal, which policy sources previously told Reuters will be kept steady at around 6.5 percent as the central government shifts its focus to quality from high growth.
Premier Li Keqiang said this week that the ""three tough battles"" for China's economy are reducing poverty, controlling pollution and curtailing risks.
Shanghai and Beijing, which are not part of any province, together accounted for 7 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) last year. Each has a population of more than 20 million. 
The two cities are often magnets for both government and private investors, and in recent years, property speculators. While Shanghai remains synonymous with profit-driven entrepreneurship, Beijing is developing a reputation as a hub for technological start-ups. 
Shanghai's economy grew 6.9 percent last year to 3 trillion yuan ($469 billion), with services accounting for 69 percent of its economy. Beijing expanded 6.7 percent to 2.8 trillion yuan, with its high tech and strategic new industries surging more than 10 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s exports to China and Asia hit record levels as shipments rose for a 13th straight month in December and manufacturing growth hit a four-year high in January, pointing to an economy that powered through the fourth quarter and into 2018.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Wednesday that exports rose 9.3 percent in December from a year earlier, versus a 10.1 percent gain seen by economists and following a 16.2 percent gain in November.
A survey out on Wednesday showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in January at the fastest pace in almost four years, reporting solid output and employment levels. 
Wednesday's data comes after the Bank of Japan offered a more upbeat view of inflation expectations on Tuesday, showing its conviction a strengthening recovery will gradually push price growth to its 2 percent target.
By value, exports reached 7.3 trillion yen ($66.27 billion) in December, the biggest amount since September 2008 when the last global financial crisis erupted.
Policymakers hope robust external demand for Japanese goods can help stoke a virtuous cycle of business investment, consumer spending and growth in Japan's economy, the world's third largest.
""We still think that net trade supported GDP growth last quarter"" as export volumes likely outpaced imports, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Given that consumer spending rebounded last quarter, the upshot is that GDP should have recorded another strong rise last quarter.""
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 15.8 percent year-on-year in December led by semiconductor production equipment and electronics parts, hitting a record 1.5 trillion yen.
Shipments to Asia as a whole, which account for more than half of Japan's exports, grew 9.9 percent in the year to December, led by China-bound semiconductor manufacturing equipment and mobile phone parts and steel shipments to Taiwan, reaching a record 4.1 trillion yen in value.
JAPAN-U.S. TRADE TALKS
Wednesday's data comes as Tokyo and Washington kick off working-level trade talks this week, putting the focus on Japan's trade surplus after the United States imposed tariffs on South Korean washing machines and Chinese solar panels. 
Eleven countries aiming to forge an Asia-Pacific trade pact after the United States pulled out of an earlier version are set to sign an agreement in Chile in March, a big win for Tokyo which is pushing for multilateral rather than bilateral trade frameworks.
Wednesday's trade data showed exports to the United States rose 3.0 percent in the year to December, led by construction and mining machinery and steel, following a 13.0 percent gain in the previous month.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 1.0 percent in December to 712 billion yen, posting the first decline in six months.
For the whole of 2017, Japan's overall exports grew 11.8 percent from a year before to 78.3 trillion yen, led by South Korea's demand for semiconductor production equipment, U.S.-bound car shipments and steel exports to Taiwan.
U.S.-bound exports rose 6.8 percent to 15.1 trillion yen in 2017, led by cars and car parts, bringing Japan's trade surplus with the United States to 7 trillion yen.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.4 in January from a final 54.0 in December.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 17th consecutive month and reached the highest level since February 2014.
""The strongest reading in the PMI since February 2014 was supported by quickened rates of output and employment growth,"" said Joe Hayes, Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The output component of the PMI index rose to a preliminary 54.7 from 54.5 in the previous month to also reach a peak not seen since February 2014.
The employment reading was at its highest in two months, while the index for output prices rose to a preliminary 52.0 from 51.0 in December, the best level since October 2008.
The PMI index for output prices suggests government data measuring consumer prices may start to accelerate, a welcome sign for the Bank of Japan in its quest to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.
Japan's economy has been in rude health over the past year, thanks in part to an exports revival amid solid global demand.
Gross domestic product has expanded for the past seven quarters, the strongest run of growth in a decade. The output gap shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years. Stock prices are at their highest in 26 years, and corporate profits are near an all-time high.

Business investment is rising, exports are growing and the labor market is the tightest in decades, due partly to a shrinking population.

Banks and investors from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt began pulling deposits and other funds out of Qatar in June, when those four nations cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha.
But in December, deposits in Qatari banks by customers located abroad rose by 2.2 billion riyals ($606 million) from the previous month to 137.1 billion riyals, the data showed. They stood at 184.6 billion riyals in May, before the embargo.
Bankers say the vast majority of the four countries' deposits in Qatar have now been pulled out, leaving little money left to withdraw. Meanwhile, the Qatari economy's stability since the embargo was imposed has helped banks attract money from other foreign depositors.
To protect the banks from deposit outflows, Qatar's government has been pumping some of its own money into the banks. The Qatari public sector boosted its deposits in local banks by 7.1 billion riyals in December to 315.4 billion riyals.
Meanwhile, Qatari banks owed banks outside the country 177.3 billion riyals in December, up from 176.7 billion riyals in November. 
Qatari banks' borrowing from foreign banks fell sharply in the initial months of the embargo as institutions from the four Arab countries stopped extending loans. But borrowing has started to edge up again as Qatari banks find other sources of loans in Asia and Europe.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economists' confidence in Latin America's prospects is strengthening ahead of major elections in the region as global growth accelerates, the latest Reuters survey found.
For all but one of the region's major economies, respondents either increased or maintained their growth forecasts from the previous poll in October.
The sole exception was Mexico, where interest rates are likely to remain high for longer than previously anticipated. Concerns over U.S. protectionism and a nationalist presidential candidate have weighed on the peso, stoking fears of faster inflation. 
Overall, however, loose monetary policies in rich countries have been lifting global growth estimates, despite geopolitical tensions in North Korea and the Middle East. 
""Growth momentum had previously been restricted to developed economies, but now emerging economies are joining in,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said. ""While local factors, particularly elections, should still matter a great deal, the baseline for growth now seems higher.""
Take Brazil, for instance.
Latin America's largest economy is likely to grow 2.5 percent in 2018, up from a previous median forecast of 2.3 percent, according to the survey conducted between Jan. 9 and 22.
For 2019, the economists raised their outlook for gross domestic product growth to 2.8 percent from 2.5 percent.
That optimism follows a faster-than-expected recovery in Brazil last year as record-low interest rates and slow inflation propped up consumer spending.
Most economists expected the upswing to continue in coming years, with investment slowly increasing after last year's much-awaited revival as companies fill up idle capacity.
But sustained growth also hinges on policymakers' ability to tackle public debt, cut social security spending and implement unpopular pro-market policies, the respondents said.
With President Michel Temer's approval rating at single digits, that burden will largely fall on the winner of the most wide-open and hard-to-predict presidential elections in decades.
""We cannot rule out an alternative scenario where political and fiscal risks materialize, bringing the recovery to an end and perhaps even generating a new economic crisis,"" BBVA (MC:BBVA) economists led by Juan Manuel Ruiz wrote in a report.
Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been leading polls, but he could be barred from running if a higher court upholds his conviction for corruption this week.
Below him, the field is split among various potential candidates, from law-and-order Congressman Jair Bolsonaro to businessman-turned-mayor João Doria and nationalist Ciro Gomes.
CAUTION ABOUT MEXICO 
Expectations of solid economic growth seem to be widespread throughout the region. The poll showed Chile and Colombia both expanding 3.0 percent in 2019, in line with the previous survey, while respondents raised their forecast for Peru's growth next year to 4.0 percent from 3.8 percent.
But economists cut their outlook for Mexico's GDP increase to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent for 2019, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous polls for both years. 
This would be the first time the region's No. 2 economy would lag Brazil's since 2013 and suggests it is more vulnerable to local problems than its peers.
Uncertainty surrounding negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 2018 elections appear to be driving caution among economists.
A Reuters poll showed most economists expected NAFTA to undergo only marginal changes despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap the treaty that underpins more than $1 trillion per year in trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Still, Mexico's peso is likely to suffer as the negotiations drag on, lifting inflation and forcing the central bank to keep rates high.
Concerns that front-runner candidate Andres Manuel López Obrador's nationalist platform stokes tensions with Trump's administration should also prompt investors to seek protection in the U.S. dollar, economists said.
In a recent survey of foreign exchange strategists, Grupo Banorte forecast the peso would probably weaken ahead of the presidential vote then rebound in a relief rally.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers jumped in January to an 11-year high, the Reuters Tankan poll showed on Monday, highlighting corporate optimism driven by nearly two years of uninterrupted economic expansion and a buoyant stock market.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, followed a key gauge of capital spending out last week showing Japan Inc's readiness to spend some of their huge cash pile, potentially spurring a virtuous cycle of investment, consumption and growth. 
The positive data should bolster the confidence of the central bank, which is set to issue a rosy view of the economy at its two-day policy-setting meeting ending on Tuesday.
Stability in currencies, global demand for electronics and cars, and capital expenditure were cited among factors behind bullish manufacturing sentiment seen in the Reuters poll of 547 large and mid-sized companies. 
Some 255 companies responded to the anonymous survey during the January 4-17 polling period.
""The market related to industrial machinery and semiconductors is buoyant, with the latter in particular skyrocketing,"" a manager at a rubber manufacturer wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 35 in January, up from 27 in December, the first rise in three months.
Manufacturers in areas such as steel/nonferrous metals and chemicals, and metal production machinery led the gain. 
The index matched the high reached in January 2007, around the time a booming economy allowed the BOJ to end a previous spell of quantitative easing and zero interest rates. The index is expected to remain unchanged over the next three months.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is expected to reassure markets at this week's policy-setting meeting that the central bank has no imminent plan to whittle down its huge monetary stimulus until its 2 percent inflation target is achieved.
In the Reuters Tankan, the service-sector sentiment index slipped to 33 in January from 34 in the previous month, with the information/communications industry falling from previous highs.
The service-sector index is expected to fall to 29 in April.
The BOJ's latest tankan showed last month that big manufacturers' confidence improved for a fifth straight quarter in December to hit an 11-year high, a sign of the economy's broadening recovery on solid external demand and hefty corporate profits.

The Reuters Tankan's sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The preliminary publication of the data for January from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment dropped to 94.4 from 95.9 in the previous month.
Analysts had forecast the reading to improve to 97.0.
The current conditions indicator also unexpectedly fell to 109.2 in January, from the previous 113.8. Economists were looking for an increase to 115.5
Consumer expectations increased to 84.8 in January, from the prior reading of 84.3. Consensus was looking for a larger increase to 90.6.
Additionally, inflation expectations for the next 12 months inched up to 2.8%, from the prior 2.7%, while the five-year gauge also edged forward to 2.5%, from the prior 2.4%.
Chief economist Richard Curtin noted that tax reform was spontaneously mentioned by 34% of all respondents while 70% of those who mentioned tax reform thought the impact would be positive, and 18% said it would be negative.
“The disconnect between the future outlook assessment and the largely positive view of the tax reform is due to uncertainties about the delayed impact of the tax reforms on the consumers,” Curtin said.
“Some of the uncertainty is related to how much a cut or an increase people, especially high income households who live in high-tax states, face,” he explained.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.2242 from around 1.2245 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3857, compared to 1.3875 previously, while USD/JPY was at 110.59 from 110.65 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 90.30 compared to 90.28 before the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stocks traded mixed after the open. The Dow Jones slipped 25 points, or 0.09%, the S&P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 10 points, or 0.14%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,334.60 a troy ounce, compared to $1,334.00 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $63.55, compared to $63.53 prior to the release."

In a report, UK Office for National Statistics said that retail sales decreased by 1.5% in December from the prior month, compared to the previous 1.0% gain which was revised from an initial 1.1% rise.

Year-on-year, core retail sales gained 1.3% in December, missing expectations for a 3.0% increase and compared to the previous month’s 1.5% rise.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Australia's economy to reach cruising altitude on global tailwind: poll,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy is seen cruising at a comfortable click over the next two years courtesy of strength in jobs, business investment and public spending, though miserly wage growth and a heavily-indebted consumer lurk as threats.
Economists polled by Reuters estimated Australia's A$1.8 trillion ($1.44 trillion) of annual gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 2.3 percent in 2017, unchanged from October's forecast.
That might prove a little low as the most recent reading for the September quarter showed growth up at 2.8 percent and all the economic news for the December quarter has been upbeat.
Analysts predicted growth would level out at 2.8 percent for both 2018 and 2019, extending Australia's already-remarkable run of 26 years without a technical recession.
While the economy might not be firing on all cylinders, there is power in just enough sectors to keep things rolling with the synchronized upturn in the world economy a timely boon.
""Australia is set to ride the global growth wave,"" said Paul Bloxham, chief economist Australia at HSBC.
""We expect GDP growth to pick up from 2.4 percent in 2017 to 3.2 percent in 2018, as rising global demand is supporting demand for exports of energy commodities, high-quality food products, tourism and education.""
Commodity exports are expanding rapidly as past mining investment comes on stream, notably in liquefied natural gas where Australia is about to become the world's largest shipper.
State governments have massively ramped up spending on infrastructure, which is spilling over into private business investment and commercial property construction.
Crucially firms have rediscovered an appetite for labor creating just over 400,000 new jobs last year, equivalent to an increase of 4.8 million in U.S. payrolls.
That has fed through to consumer confidence and fueled a much-needed rebound in spending last quarter.
Yet, as in much of the developed world, all those jobs have not translated into more pay, with annual wage growth stuck near the slowest on record. That is an oppressive drag on incomes for households, who also happen to hold a record amount of debt.
The weakness in wages has in turn contributed to a long stretch of uncomfortably low inflation.
Core measures favored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have been running below the floor of its 2-3 percent target band for much of the last two years, the chief reason it has had to keep interest rates at a record low of 1.5 percent.
Analysts polled also see only a very gradual pick up in price pressures ahead.
Consumer price inflation is forecast to average 2.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next, though at least that means the RBA should be able to keep policy loose for as long as proves necessary.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 01:12PM ET</span>",Cold weather chills U.S. homebuilding; jobless claims at 45-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in December, recording its biggest drop in just over a year, likely as unseasonably cold weather at the end of the month disrupted the construction of single-family housing units.
The steep drop in groundbreaking activity probably will be temporary against the backdrop of a tightening labor market. Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a 45-year low last week. 
""Housing starts were held down by the cold winter weather but should bounce back quickly in coming months as the country warms up from this recent cold spell,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Housing starts decreased 8.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.192 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. November's sales pace was revised up to 1.299 million units from the previously reported 1.297 million units.
The percentage drop for housing starts in December was the largest since November 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts declining to a pace of 1.275 million units last month. Homebuilding increased 2.4 percent to 1.202 million units in 2017, the highest level since 2007.
Building permits edged down 0.1 percent to a rate of 1.302 million units in December, outpacing starts, which suggests a rebound in groundbreaking in the coming months. Building permits increased 4.7 percent to 1.263 million units in 2017, also the highest level since 2007. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher after the data, outperforming a weaker U.S. stock market. Shares of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) rose 0.4 percent and those of PulteGroup (N:PHM) gained 1 percent. But shares of D.R. Horton (N:DHI), the nation's largest homebuilder, fell 1.2 percent.
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies and prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower.
Despite December's drop in housing starts, economists continued to believe that investment in homebuilding contributed to gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. 
Last month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 11.8 percent to a rate of 836,000 units as construction fell in the South, the Northeast and Midwest regions. Homebuilding was unchanged in the West.
Single-family home permits advanced 1.8 percent in December to their highest level since August 2007, suggesting an acceleration in groundbreaking on that segment of the housing sector was likely. Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 1.4 percent to a rate of 356,000 units. 
Single-family home completions surged 4.3 percent to a five-month high. The number of single-family units under construction was the highest since June 2008, which should help ease an acute shortage of properties on the market that is pushing up prices. 
There were 794,000 single-family housing units completed in 2017, the most in nine years.
""The increase in completions signals some relief for the supply shortage,"" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American in Washington. 
CLAIMS FALL SHARPLY
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 41,000 to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended Jan. 13, the lowest level since February 1973. 
Economists had forecast claims falling to 250,000 in the latest week. Claims had risen over the previous four weeks, with analysts blaming difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around moving holidays and the cold weather. 
The Labor Department said claims for seven states and one territory were estimated last week. Government offices were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
Last week marked the 150th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,250 to 244,500. The claims data covered the survey week for January's nonfarm payrolls.
The four-week average of claims rose 8,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some moderation in the pace of job growth. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 in December after surging by 252,000 in November.
Job growth is slowing as the labor market nears full employment. There has been an increase in companies reporting difficulties finding qualified workers. There are about 5.9 million job openings in the country.

""Employers are increasingly facing a mismatch between their hiring needs and the availability of qualified candidates to fill those needs,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Housing starts decreased 8.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.192 million units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. November's sales pace was revised up to 1.299 million units from the previously reported 1.297 million units.
December's percentage drop was the largest since November 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts decreasing to a pace of 1.275 million units last month. 
Homebuilding increased 2.4 percent to 1.202 million units in 2017, the highest level since 2007. December's moderation in homebuilding is likely to be temporary amid strong demand for housing that is being driven by a robust labor market.
Builders, however, continue to struggle with labor and land shortages as well as more expensive lumber. A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders slipping from an 18-year high in January. Builders expected a dip in buyer traffic and sales over the next six months.
Last month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 11.8 percent to a rate of 836,000 units. Single-family home construction fell in the South, the Northeast and Midwest. It was unchanged in the West. 

Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment rose 1.4 percent to a rate of 356,000 units. Building permits edged down 0.1 percent to a rate of 1.302 million units in December. Building permits increased 4.7 percent to 1.263 million units in 2017, also the highest level since 2007.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",China's 2017 GDP growth accelerates for first time in seven years,"By Kevin Yao and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017, as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years, defying concerns that intensifying curbs on industry and credit would hurt expansion.
The official growth figures released on Thursday are welcome news for Beijing policymakers who are looking to cut debt and pollution in older industries without stunting growth in the world's second-largest economy.
China's gross domestic product grew 6.8 percent in the October to December period from a year earlier. That was better than the 6.7 percent growth forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and unchanged from the previous quarter.
The headline numbers and signs of property market resilience support economist views that fundamentals will remain intact in 2018, although some see headwinds from tighter regulations, U.S. trade protectionism and a softer consumer sector.
""China's growth is very healthy,"" said Iris Pang, a Hong Kong-based Greater China economist at ING.
""The risks that we worried about in 2017, for example overcapacity cuts having a negative impact on GDP, did not happen because new sectors are actually coming out to help production to grow.""
Growth for the 2017 full year picked up to 6.9 percent year-on-year, the first annual acceleration for the economy since 2010. The annual growth easily beat the government's 2017 target of around 6.5 percent and quickened from 6.7 percent in 2016, the weakest pace in 26 years.
Investment by private firms rose 6 percent in the Jan-Dec period, up from 5.7 percent growth in January to November, a sign that the private sector outlook may be improving.
TRADE-BASED RECOVERY
A synchronized uptick in the global economy over the past year, driven in part by a surge in demand for semiconductors and other technology products, has been a boon to China and much of trade-dependent Asia, with Chinese exports in 2017 growing at their quickest pace in four years.
With fixed asset-investment growth at the weakest pace since 1999, exports helped pick up the slack.
""Real growth of overall exports...more than fully (explained) the pick-up in GDP growth last year,"" Oxford Economics head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs wrote in a note. 
But there could be rising headwinds to further expansion of China's net exports this year.
China's excess production capacity has emerged as a major trade irritant for the world's leading economic powers, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering several unilateral tariff actions on steel, aluminum and China's intellectual property practices likely to draw disputes from WTO members. 
China's exports and imports growth slowed in December after surging in the previous month.
""Downside risks remain, in particular from more forceful U.S. trade restrictions on Chinese exports, given the further increase in the U.S.'s bilateral trade deficit with China last year,"" said Kuijs. 
MIXED SIGNALS
Economists say growth momentum in the economy is likely to weaken this year as firms face higher borrowing costs, the government tries to rein in credit and policymakers step up a war on pollution that has hurt the industrial sector in many parts of the country.
""The priority this year is to control risks, especially financial risks. This will, to some extent, affect financing of the real economy. I think growth will be 6.6 to 6.7 percent,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing.
Retail sales growth of 9.4 percent was the slowest rate since February 2006, down from 10.2 percent growth in November and badly missing forecasts. 
There were some positive signs in the household sector in 2017, however, with disposable income growth picking up to 7.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2016, and final consumption playing a bigger role in driving overall growth last year versus investment than in 2016. 
""The decline in December retail sales growth is mainly due to slowing auto sales last month. The data is a reflection of consumption of physical goods, but right now consumption growth is in services, which is not included in the data,"" said Zhang Yiping, an economist at China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen.
""I don’t think retail sales can reflect the trend in consumption any more.""
DOUBTS ABOUT DATA
Several recent public revelations by regional governments of fraudulent government data have again raised doubts about the quality of China's economic numbers.
Chinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking up numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance is often assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed.
The head of China's statistics bureau Ning Jizhe told reporters on Thursday that China will look into reports of irregularities in regional economic data, and will deal with any impropriety according to the law.
Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard believes the official numbers are hiding the true extent of some of the economy's soft spots. 
""We think tight monetary conditions and slowing credit growth will continue to weigh on the pace of economic expansion in coming quarters,"" Evans-Pritchard said in a note. 

""Indeed, we expect growth to average a mere 4.5 percent this year, though investors will probably need to look beyond the official GDP figures for evidence of this.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as expected, as it monitored the effects of its November hike and remained wary of triggering disruptive capital flows.
The Bank of Korea's Monetary Policy Board voted to keep the benchmark interest rate  at 1.50 percent at what was the second last rate-setting meeting for Governor Lee Ju-yeol before his term ends in March.
All 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters between Jan. 8 and 15 predicted the BOK would keep the seven-day repurchase rate unchanged on Thursday after raising it for the first time in six years in November, ending a five-year easing cycle amid a sustained export boom.
South Korean policymakers are grappling with an unusual surge in the won against the dollar and households saddled with debt after a property-buying spree, supporting analysts' views that monetary policy will remain accommodative in 2018. 
The Korean won has soared to its highest in more than three years since the board last met on Nov. 30, while consumer inflation in December remained below the bank's target of 2 percent. 
The won touched as high as 1058.8 on Jan. 8, its highest intraday trading level since October 2014.
""The won soaring through the new year period will keep policymakers on hold for now, along with the need to monitor policy changes abroad,"" said Lee Jae-hyung, a fixed-income analyst at Yuanta Securities.
The won  was muted after the BOK decision, trading at 1,069.1 per dollar as of 0101 GMT compared to its previous close of 1,069.3. The benchmark Kospi (KS11) was up 0.4 percent at 2,523.87, nearly unchanged from opening on Thursday. 
Growth in the third quarter showed the biggest jump in seven years, expanding 1.5 percent from a quarter earlier on exports driven by strong global demand for memory chips.
The finance ministry expects the economic recovery to continue this year, but sees the economy growing at a slightly slower pace than last year's pace of 3.2 percent as slowing investment weighs on the economy.
The bank is due to release new economic estimates at 1:30 p.m. (0430 GMT).
Kim Ji-man, a fixed-income analyst at HMC Investment & Securities, said a significant upward revision in the BOK's growth outlook for this year from the current 2.9 percent could provide further clues on its next move.
""July this year would probably be appropriate for the bank to raise interest rates again, as policymakers would be able to confirm if growth for the first half is on track for solid recovery by then,"" Kim said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China and Japan, the two biggest foreign U.S. creditors, reduced their holdings of U.S. government debt in November when the dollar weakened against the two countries' currencies, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Wednesday showed.
Their reduced position in Treasuries supported the notion that foreign central banks are cutting back their dollar exposure in their foreign exchange reserves.
""Reserve diversification has grabbed headlines recently with the underperformance of both the U.S. dollar and Treasuries consistent with expectations of central banks reducing allocation to USD (U.S. dollar),"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists Adarsh Sinha and Yang Chen wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund said the dollar's share of global currency reserves shrank in the third quarter of 2017 to 63.5 percent, its smallest since mid-2014.
China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries fell to $1.176 trillion in November, its lowest in four months. The largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt owned $1.189 trillion in October, according to the Treasury's latest capital flows data.
Japan, the second largest holder of Treasuries, scaled back its stake in U.S. government debt for a third straight month to $1.084 trillion. This was the lowest level since $1.083 trillion in June 2013.
Overall foreign official institutions sold $6.7 billion in Treasuries in November. They have been unloading their U.S. government debt holdings nearly every month going back to at least 2014.
Back in November, the Chinese yuan  gained 0.36 percent versus the greenback, while the Japanese yen  rose 0.97 percent against the dollar, Reuters data showed.
The dollar ended up 2017 with its worst annual performance since 2003 on expectations central banks besides the Federal Reserve are preparing to end the emergency policy measures they adopted to combat the 2008 global credit crisis and the recession that ensued.

While overseas central banks continued to roll back their Treasury exposure, private offshore investors have shown steady appetite for U.S. stocks and corporate bonds amid an improving global economy.
Net overseas purchase of domestic equities totaled $12.67 billion in November, marginally higher than $12.31 billion the month before. 
Total net purchase of corporate bonds grew to $28.7 billion, the most in at least January 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production increased more than expected in December as unseasonably cold weather at the end of the month boosted demand for heating, but manufacturing output barely rose, pointing to moderate growth in the industrial sector.
Strong demand for utilities reported by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday bolstered expectations of an acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter, prompting some economists to bump up their economic growth estimates for the October-December period.
""This is consistent with the solid growth story,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Fed said industrial output surged 0.9 percent last month also buoyed by robust gains in mining production, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production advancing 0.4 percent in December. It rose at an annual rate of 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2010. 
For all of 2017, industrial output rose 1.8 percent, the first and largest increase since 2014. In another report, the U.S. central bank said the economy continued to expand from late November through the end of 2017. 
In its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, the Fed said ""the outlook for 2018 remains optimistic for a majority of contacts across the country.""
The reports were seen supportive of an interest rate increase in March from the Fed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note hitting a nine-year high. The dollar briefly rose against a basket of currencies, but later surrendered gains.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
MODEST FACTORY OUTPUT GAIN
Manufacturing output, which accounts for more than 70 percent of industrial production, gained only 0.1 percent in December. Data for October and November was, however, revised to show factory output rising 1.5 percent and 0.3 percent respectively instead of the previously reported 1.4 percent and 0.2 percent.
Manufacturing output last month was held back by a 1.5 percent drop in the production of primary metals. Motor vehicle and parts production increased 2.0 percent. 
Manufacturing production rose at a 7.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2010. It increased 1.3 percent in 2017, the largest rise since 2012.
The industrial sector is being supported by a strengthening global economy and recent dollar weakness, which is helping to make U.S. exports more competitive relative to those of the nation's main trading partners. 
It is likely to be boosted by a $1.5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. A survey early this month showed an acceleration in factory activity in December, with a measure of new orders recording its best reading since January 2004.
""A positive fundamental backdrop of tax cuts, solid domestic and global demand, a weaker dollar, firmer energy prices and somewhat leaner inventories all translate into solid prospects for industrial activity in 2018,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Mining production increased 1.6 percent in December amid a rebound in oil and gas well drilling. Utilities production accelerated 5.6 percent last month after declining 3.1 percent in November.
Bitter cold gripped a large part of the country at the end of December. The surge in utilities demand added to strong December retail sales in supporting expectations of an acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter.
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised its fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.8 percent annualized rate.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) lifted its GDP growth forecast to a 3.1 percent pace from a 3.0 percent rate. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent rate in the July-September period.
The surge in industrial production pushed up capacity utilization, a measure of how fully industries are deploying their resources, to 77.9 percent. That was the highest since February 2015 and followed a 77.2 percent rate in November. 

Capacity utilization is 2 percentage points below its long-run average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through the end of the year, showed pricing pressures grew at a moderate pace despite ongoing tighter labor market conditions. This has confounded the Fed's expectations that tighter labor market conditions would spur a rebound inflation.
“The economy continued to expand from late November through the end of the year, with 11 Districts reporting modest to moderate gains ” according to the report, released Wednesday in Washington. “The outlook for 2018 remains optimistic for a majority of contacts across the country""
Despite the lack of pricing pressures reported across the Fed's regional districts, the most recent reading of the consumer price index showed US consumer prices posted their biggest gain in eleven-months raising 1.8% in the 12 months through December.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada raised interest rates on Wednesday, as expected, but said that while more rate hikes are probably warranted, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to maintain optimal growth and inflation.
The third rate increase in seven months took borrowing costs to their highest level since 2009, but the bank's cautious tone on the future of NAFTA trade pact accomplished the so-called dovish hike that many analysts had predicted.
""While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target,"" the bank said.
The future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to terminate, was the most significant downside risk cited by the bank in an otherwise bullish report on the outlook for Canada's economic growth.
The Canadian dollar weakened modestly after the hike as investors realized that markets may have gone too far in pricing in more or faster rate hikes than the bank is contemplating.
""It seems the Bank of Canada is leaning towards a more dovish stance and certainly playing up the concerns around NAFTA. That should pose some questions to all those rate hikes priced into the market,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.
The hike acknowledges that recent data has come in stronger than the bank had expected, inflation is close to its 2 percent target, and the economy is now operating at full potential with no output gap. 
The central bank raised its forecast for GDP growth and inflation in 2018, noting stronger-than-expected consumption and residential investment, and said business investment and exports are expected to contribute more to growth going forward. 
It also said labor market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated.
Still, while the bank's forecasts looked relatively robust, its cautious tone signaled policymakers will not rush their efforts to return rates to more normal levels after they were slashed to historic lows in the wake of the financial crisis.
The bank said that trade uncertainty is expected to cut investment by about 2 percent by the end of 2019, while U.S. tax reforms will trim another 0.5 percent as firms may decide to redirect spending from Canada to the United States to benefit from lower corporate taxes.

The central bank said underlying fundamentals are strong and would support more robust investment growth were it not for the heightened trade risks and increased incentive for businesses to move investment from Canada to the United States.
Canada is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico. With U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly threatening to pull out of the pact, concerns have risen ahead of the next round of talks later this month.
The trade uncertainty is expected to reduce the level of investment by about 2 percent by the end of 2019, the bank said in its Monetary Policy Report. That is an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to its October projection.
""Although their investment intentions indicate plans to boost spending, respondents to the Business Outlook Survey are increasingly concerned about the ongoing NAFTA negotiations and rising protectionism more generally,"" the central bank said, referring to its quarterly survey.
The updated projections were released as the central bank raised interest rates to 1.25 percent, saying that while more hikes are probably warranted, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to maintain optimal growth and inflation.
The bank also introduced into its projection the potential negative effects of recent U.S. tax reforms, estimating they will take another 0.5 percent off Canadian investment by the end of next year.
""Firms may decide to redirect some of their planned investment spending from Canada to the United States to benefit from the lower corporate taxes,"" the bank said.
Overall, the bank forecast business investment will contribute 0.4 percentage points to economic growth this year and 0.3 percentage points in 2019, unchanged from its October forecast. 
Exports were expected to be impacted by the tax and trade factors as well. Although the tax changes were seen benefiting the U.S. economy and therefore boosting the level of Canadian exports by about 1 percent by the end of 2019, that was tempered by an expected 0.7 percent drag from trade uncertainty over the same time frame.

""Canada's ability to benefit from an improving global outlook continues to be hindered by uncertainty around the status of trade arrangements,"" the bank said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese orders for machinery surged to their highest level in a decade in November, in a sign businesses may finally be responding to policymakers' efforts to get companies to spend their massive cash piles to spur economic growth.
The key measure of capital expenditure was issued just as Japan's top business lobby urged companies to raise wages by 3 percent in upcoming annual salary negotiations with unions, supporting the government's efforts to accelerate inflation.
The developments suggest premier Shinzo Abe is finally succeeding in nudging risk-shy firms to boost spending and help him stoke a virtuous cycle of business investment, consumer spending and growth in the world's third-largest economy.
They also come as welcome news for the central bank, which is set to paint an optimistic picture of the economy next week to signal its next policy move would be to dial back - not ramp up - its massive monetary stimulus.
""A lot of the growth in Japan is fairly cyclical, but I want to acknowledge some progress in structural reforms,"" said Christian de Guzman, a vice president of sovereign ratings at Moody's Investors Service.
""Japan has very favorable funding conditions. This refers not only to interest rates but also savings in the household and corporate sectors.""
Cabinet Office data out on Wednesday showed core orders for machinery, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 5.7 percent in November from the previous month, driven by non-manufacturers.
Core orders, which exclude ships and orders from electric power utilities, handily beat a 1.4 percent drop seen in a Reuters poll of analysts, following 5.0 percent growth in October, posting the fastest rise in four months.
Analysts expect capital spending to remain in a gradual uptrend, given hefty company profits, negative interest rates, the need for labor-saving technologies to counter labor shortages, and procurement for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
""The bigger picture is that firms are facing the most severe capacity shortages since the early 1990s,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
FRESH CHALLENGES
Japan's economy is in its best shape in years, led by strong global demand lifting exports and corporate earnings, although inflation remains subdued because of sluggish wage growth and weak consumer spending.
With corporate profits at record-high levels, Abe has resorted to carrot-and-stick tactics to spur investment and boost wages, offering tax breaks to those who comply.
Increasing signs of strength in the economy have brought fresh challenges for policymakers.
Investors pushed up global bond yields and the yen on expectations the Bank of Japan could follow the footsteps of other major banks and dial back stimulus earlier than expected.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to reassure markets at next week's rate review that the central bank has no imminent plans to whittle down its huge monetary support, though analysts doubt whether he will succeed in convincing markets.
The central bank has kept borrowing costs ultra-low not just for companies but for Japan's government which, after years of spending to spur growth, is saddled with the largest public debt of the major industrialized nations.
Any signs of a shift away from ultra-easy monetary policy would put more strain on Japan's dire fiscal state and force the government to step up efforts to get its fiscal house in order.
The Japanese government bond market got a jolt at the start of the year when the BOJ cut its bond market purchases slightly, sending 10-year yields to a 2-1/2-month high of 0.080 percent.
Moody's does not see any imminent threat as it does not expect the BOJ to tighten monetary policy soon, which would make servicing government debt more expensive.
""The recent rise in yields doesn't imply that Japan's funding conditions will worsen,"" de Guzman of Moody's told reporters at a briefing.
""Japan has some outstanding debt with rates of 1 or 2 percent. It can refinance that debt at around zero rates.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's current account surplus was the world's largest in 2017, the Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday, unveiling a record high reading likely to renew criticism of the economic and fiscal policies in Europe's largest economy.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have for years urged Germany to lift domestic demand and imports in order to reduce global economic imbalances and fuel global growth, including within the euro zone.
Ifo said the German current account surplus -- which measures the flow of goods, services and investments -- was the world's largest for the second year running in 2017 at $287 billion, followed by Japan with $203 billion.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Germany for doing too little to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, accusing Germany of ""very bad"" trade policies.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has pushed back, pointing to private consumption becoming the main driver of growth.
Merkel also pointed out that the German surplus is mainly a result of the interplay of supply and demand on global markets and that Berlin has only limited influence on other important factors such as the euro exchange rate and energy prices.
But Holger Bingmann, president of Germany's BGA trade association, told Reuters that the record surplus should prod the world's fourth largest economy to do more to encourage imports.
""It is important that we as Germany also commit ourselves to promote imports,"" Bingmann said, defending Germany's exporting prowess: ""Good products seem to always find a market.""
Ifo said China slipped to third place last year with a surplus of $135 billion, less than half Germany's.
The German current account surplus fell to 7.8 percent of total output in 2017 from 8.3 percent in the previous year.
""Traded goods are the main reason for the German surplus,"" said Ifo economist Christian Grimme. ""The main driver was high demand from the European Union and the United States.""

In the first 11 months of last year, Germany's trade surplus in goods was 249 billion euros ($304.85 billion) as exports continued to outstrip imports.

In a report, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 3.0% last month, in line with expectations compared to November’s 3.1% increase which had been the highest inflation since March 2012.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.4% in December, also in line with forecasts and compared to the 0.3% gain registered in the previous month.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.5% last month, below forecasts for a 2.6% and the 2.7% advance registered in November.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 4.1% on an annualized basis in December, compared to previous month’s 3.9% rise. Analysts had expected inflation to match November’s reading.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.8% in December, higher than the 0.2% rise seen a month earlier and the forecast for a 0.6% gain.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 4.2% in last month, higher than the 4.0% rise registered a month earlier.
Month-on-month, core RPI rose by 0.8% in December, compared to the 0.1% increase seen the previous month.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.1% in December, following a 5.4% increase a month earlier. November’s data was revised up from an initial 4.5% rise.
The ONS indicated that the downward effect came mainly from air fares, along with a fall in the prices of a range of recreational goods, particularly games and toys.
“The downward contributions were partially offset by an increase in tobacco prices, reflecting duty increases that came into effect following the Autumn Budget, along with an increase in petrol and diesel prices,” the ONS added.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3773 from around 1.3784 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8878 from 0.8872 earlier while GBP/JPY changed hands at 152.44, compared to 152.56 previously.

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, rose 4.1 percent from December 2016, while home prices were up 9.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the group's home price index.
Activity was up in close to 60 percent of all markets, including the Toronto area, with sales fully recovering from the slump last summer, CREA said.
Still, the market is braced for a possible slowdown in January, as new mortgage stress tests required by the regulator are expected to take some homebuyers out of the market.
""It will be interesting to see if monthly sales activity continues to rise despite tighter mortgage regulations that took effect on January 1st,"" CREA's Chief Economist Gregory Klump said in the report.
The housing market in Toronto, Canada's largest city, and nearby cities cooled dramatically in the summer after the province imposed new measures to curb speculation, including a foreign buyers tax, amid fears of a housing bubble.
Analysts are divided over whether the nation's long housing boom will crash or achieve a soft landing as a series of mortgage rule changes and rising interest rates weigh on demand. 
The CREA report showed the number of new listings rose 3.3 percent in December, while the inventory dipped to 4.5 months.
The national average price for homes sold in December rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier to just over C$496,500 ($399,565), continuing a deceleration in home price appreciation as the softening in Toronto took some steam out of price gains.

Gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent year on year in November, the economy ministry said, contrasting with analysts' consensus call for a 1.5 percent growth.
Russia's oil-dependent economy was on the mend in 2017 after two years of recession, triggered by a sharp drop in global commodity prices as well as sanctions imposed by Western countries against Moscow for its role in the Ukrainian crisis.
In November, GDP was dragged down by the industrial sector where output contracted 3.6 percent compared with a year ago.
The economy ministry said it blamed the weaker industrial output on the global agreement of major oil producers, including Russia, to limit crude production in order to prop up commodity prices.
The ministry also said the industrial output sank because of the warm weather, which pressured demand for natural gas on either domestic and foreign markets. 
November's contraction in GDP after a 1.0 percent growth in year-on-year terms in October prompted the economy ministry to revise GDP growth figures for the whole of 2017.
The ministry said on Monday the economy grew by 1.4-1.8 percent in 2017. Ahead of November's contraction, Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin pledged the economy would grow by at least 2.2 percent that year.
Now the ministry expects economic growth pace to pick up in 2018 to around 2 percent, with inflation to stay below the central bank's target of 4 percent if there are no weather shocks.
In January, inflation is seen staying at record lows between 2.3 and 2.5 percent, the economy ministry said.

Low inflation would give the central bank room for further rate cuts. The central bank said last month as it chopped the key rate to 7.75 percent from 8.25 percent it expected inflation to return back to the 4 percent target by the end of 2018.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's December trade deficit widened to its highest in more than three years as higher import bills for gold and crude oil weighed on rising exports, government data showed on Monday.
The trade deficit  widened to $14.88 billion last month from $13.83 billion in November, data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry showed.
The trade deficit has widened by about $36.4 billion in the first three quarters of the current financial year to $114.86 billion. That could put pressure on the current account deficit of Asia's third largest economy.
India, the world's third biggest oil consumer, shipped in crude and refined products worth $10.35 billion, about 35 percent more than a year ago, largely due to a spurt in global oil prices (LCOc1).
Gold imports by India, the world's second biggest consumer of the precious metal after China, surged 71.5 percent to $3.4 billion, the data showed.
The country's overseas gold purchases in December stood at 70 tonnes, up 40 percent from a year ago, provisional data from precious metals consultancy GFMS showed.
Overall imports during December rose by 21.12 percent to $41.91 billion.

Exports  during the month were up 12.36 percent to slightly more than $27 billion, mainly due to a 25.32 percent rise in engineering goods exports to $7.4 billion.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil expanded for a third straight month in November, the longest stretch of gains since 2014, suggesting strong momentum at the end of the year.
The central bank's economic activity index rose 0.49 percent from October after seasonal adjustments, in line with the median 0.50 percent forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The figures are the latest indication that Latin America's largest economy may have shifted up a gear at the end of 2017 after a much-awaited investments revival in the third quarter.
Brazil's gross domestic product likely grew around 1 percent last year, snapping a two-year period of contraction as slow inflation and record low interest rates propped up consumer spending.
Economists forecast 2.8 percent growth in 2018, according to a weekly central bank survey, which would be the fastest since 2013.

Non-oil domestic exports in December were expected to have climbed 8.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in the survey of 10 economists, cooling slightly from the 9.1 percent rise in November.
The continued on-year increases seen in exports in 2017 have been driven by healthy global demand and would have been exacerbated by the holiday season in December, analysts say. 
""We had a stellar year last year so I think the more interesting question to look forward to is if we will see a further slowdown in the first quarter of 2018,"" OCBC economist Selena Ling said.
Although external demand remains robust, headline numbers in the coming months are expected to show a less dramatic increase in part because of last year's high base.
""We will probably see some easing in terms of momentum, but probably not anything that's going to be slamming on the brakes for now,"" Ling told Reuters. 
The exports boom has benefited Singapore and other trade-dependent Asian economies, particularly for makers of electronics products and components such as semiconductors.
In a research note to its clients this month, Moody's said ""tech exports remain the bright spot"" for Singapore's exports. 
On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, however, exports were expected to have fallen 4.5 percent in December, the poll found, compared with an 8.7 percent rise in November. 

Singapore's economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter as factories lost steam, but a services sector recovery has bolstered expectations the central bank could tighten monetary policy as early as April.

The European statistics office Eurostat said the euro zone's surplus in goods trade rose in unadjusted terms to 26.3 billion euros in November, up from 18.9 billions in October. It was also higher than the 23.8 billion surplus recorded a year earlier.
The November trade expansion, which coincided with a new rise of the euro against the dollar, brought the bloc's surplus to its highest monthly level since March when it stood at 28.7 billion euros.
Adjusting to seasonal patterns, the bloc's trade surplus expanded to 22.5 billion euros in November from 19 billions a month earlier, Eurostat said.
The boost was caused by an increased demand for euro zone goods from the rest of the world, which more than offset the higher volume of imports into the bloc.
In unadjusted terms, euro zone exports grew to a volume of 197.5 billion euros in November from 187.8 billions a month earlier. In the same period, imports increased to 171.2 billions from 168.9 billion euros.
In November exports rose 7.7 percent on the year, while imports increased by 7.3 percent.
In the period between January and November, euro zone exports increased 7.5 percent, compared with the same period in the previous year. Imports were up by 10.1 percent.

Trade among the 19 euro zone countries also expanded in November to a volume of 165.5 billion euros, a 6.9 percent rise from a year earlier.

The PayNet Small Business Lending index rose to 116.9 from an upwardly revised 115.3 in October, making for the first increase since April 2017. However, the measure of borrowing by medium-sized firms declined to 201.1 from 217.3.
Lending to small companies in the construction sector rose to 155.5 from 151.4, while transportation rose to 96.3 from 93.7.
Retail companies also rose to 201.8 from 198.2, though the manufacturing sector continued to lag, with its index falling to 59.4 from 60.8.
Although lending activity to small firms was down 1 percent compared to a year ago, the month-over-month gain is a positive sign that such firms could help lead economic growth, said PayNet President Bill Phelan.
""The small businesses are the canary in the coal mine, the leading economic indicator,"" Phelan said.
Although the economy is expected to have moderated in the second half of 2017 after a blistering first half, fourth-quarter growth is still anticipated to be relatively robust.
The PayNet report showed companies' financial health continued to look strong in November, with the number of firms that were delinquent by 30 days or more declining to 0.86 percent from 0.88 percent. Those that were 90 days or more behind also fell to 0.25 percent from 0.28 percent.

Although the emissions test-cheating scandal of September 2015 has cost the German group billions of euros in fines and penalties, it does not seem to have caused major damage to the carmaker's popularity with consumers.
Deliveries rose 4.2 percent in 2017 to 6.23 million Volkswagen (VW) brand cars, the automaker said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show, helped by an expanding line-up of sport-utility vehicles including the all-new Atlas and Teramont models.
Sales in December rose 5.6 percent to a new record of 594,100 cars.
Higher deliveries at the mass-market brand, accounting for almost 60 percent of VW group sales, may have helped the Wolfsburg-based company beat Toyota (T:7203) for a second year in the global sales race. VW's premium divisions, Audi (DE:NSUG) and Porsche, had already posted record 2017 deliveries last week.
Toyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year. VW is due to announce 2017 deliveries for the group as a whole on Jan. 17.
In China, VW's largest market, accounting for about half the core brand's deliveries, sales rose 5.9 percent last year to 3.18 million cars. In the United States, they were up 5.2 percent to 339,700.
Deliveries fell 2.5 percent to 1.43 million in the higher-margin but diesel-heavy western European market as customers reacted to a backlash against diesel technology in the wake of VW's emissions trickery.
Sales of the VW brand, which is pushing a turnaround plan to revive profits, may continue to outpace rivals, according to industry forecaster IHS Markit.
Deliveries of VW passenger cars and light commercial vehicles could increase 14.6 percent to 7.75 million units by 2025 from 6.76 million last year, IHS data indicated.

That compares with gains of 11.6 percent to 9.65 million at Toyota and 3.7 percent to 5.84 million at Ford (N:F).

PALM BEACH, Florida (Reuters) - President Donald Trump was briefed on Saturday by U.S. trade envoy Robert Lighthizer on U.S. trade with China and talks on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, a White House spokeswoman said, as the administration considers several new tariff moves in coming weeks.
The meeting comes as Trump mulls whether to impose broad restrictions on steel and aluminum imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing's alleged theft of intellectual property.
Lighthizer also briefed Trump on China's economy and pending trade enforcement actions, as well as the NAFTA negotiations, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement from Florida, where Trump is staying at his Mar-a-Lago resort. She did not provide details.
Lighthizer currently is preparing for the next round of NAFTA talks in Montreal. Washington has taken a hard line in the negotiations, which appear stalled with just two rounds of left, saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico to keep the deal.
Canada this week welcomed Trump's suggestion that NAFTA talks could be extended beyond March when Mexico's presidential election campaign kicks into high gear.
Trump's opportunity to impose new tariffs or trade quotas follows a U.S. Commerce Department Section 232 investigation that looked into whether foreign steel imports are a threat to U.S. national security. The department submitted the long-awaited report to the White House on Thursday.
Next week, the results of a separate investigation of rising aluminum imports will go to the White House.
China's excess production capacity for both steel and aluminum has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.
Meanwhile, China reported on Friday that exports and imports growth slowed in December after surging in the previous month, adding to signs of ebbing economic momentum as the government extends a crackdown on financial risks and factory pollution.
A synchronized uptick in the global economy over the past year has been a boon to China and much of trade-dependent Asia, with Chinese exports in 2017 growing at their quickest pace in four years.

The sharp December imports slowdown, however, is raising concerns that the world’s second-biggest economy faces domestic-demand pressure as authorities turn off cheap credit and restrict speculative financing.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 11:57AM ET</span>","South Africa to target investment, graft under new ANC leader","By Ed Stoddard
EAST LONDON, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa wants to attract foreign investors to help it kick-start economic growth and will crack down on corruption, the new leader of the ruling African National Congress said on Saturday.
Cyril Ramaphosa, who narrowly won the race to succeed President Jacob Zuma as ANC leader last month, also used a speech to mark 106 years since the founding of Africa's oldest liberation movement to call for party unity after a bitter leadership contest.
South Africa's economy has slowed to a near-standstill over Zuma's two presidential terms, as allegations of influence-peddling in government and mismanagement of state-owned enterprises have dented consumer and business confidence.
But Ramaphosa's election win has injected a sense of optimism that the ANC, which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, could win back the trust of voters and investors disillusioned with Zuma's rule.
Ramaphosa, 65, a former trade union leader and one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, pledged during his campaign for ANC leader to address record unemployment and a sluggish economy.
""South Africa is open for investment,"" he told tens of thousands of cheering ANC members in a stadium in the Eastern Cape province on Saturday. Through foreign investment ""we can grow our economy, create jobs, end poverty,"" he said.
""We must have an economy that offers policy certainty and addresses areas that inhibit investment, growth as well as social inclusion.""
Ramaphosa reassured investors that the role, mandate and independence of the central bank would be maintained while plans for free higher education for the poor would be implemented gradually so as to safeguard public finances.
The ANC needs to follow the example of liberation hero Nelson Mandela to unite the country and combat the racial inequalities that persist to this day, he added.
Ramaphosa faces a difficult balancing act as he must accommodate the competing interests of rival ANC factions vying for control of the party. One faction backed his bid for ANC leader, while another favored Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former cabinet minister and ex-wife of Zuma.
ZUMA'S FUTURE
There has been widespread speculation that Ramaphosa and his allies are lobbying ANC members to oust Zuma as head of state in the coming weeks, but he made no mention of Zuma's future.
Zuma, 75, sat alongside Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to hear Ramaphosa speak and was booed on several occasions during Saturday's anniversary celebrations.
Zuma's second presidential term doesn't officially end until 2019 when national elections will be held, but he could be removed early through a motion of no confidence in parliament or at a meeting of the ANC's national executive committee.
Ramaphosa welcomed Zuma's recent announcement that there would be an inquiry into influence-peddling in government and said it was a top priority for those responsible to be prosecuted.
Zuma has denied allegations that he has allowed his friends to influence the appointment of ministers. Ramaphosa said that corruption in the private sector was also an important issue.
ANC member Vanita Kok, from the Khoisan royal house, said Ramaphosa's message struck a chord because ""corruption is rife"".
While markets have rallied since Ramaphosa's victory, some analysts are skeptical he will deliver on his bold promises.

Gwen Ngwenya, an economist at South Africa's Institute of Race Relations, said: ""Ramaphosa is hamstrung by the need to ensure unity, and this will result in confused policymaking.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices recorded their largest increase in 11 months in December on strong gains in the cost of rental accommodation and healthcare, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year.
The strengthening domestic demand was also underscored by other data on Friday showing retail sales rising at a solid clip in December. The reports probably will keep the Federal Reserve on course to increase interest rates in March. 
They raised the prospects of a more aggressive monetary policy tightening this year, especially against the backdrop of a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.
The U.S. central bank is forecasting three rate increases this year. It raised borrowing costs three times in 2017.
""The economy is doing quite well right now ... and well enough for the Fed to feel compelled to take steps to take the edge off before inflation truly becomes problematic,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
  The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent last month as prices for new and used cars and trucks and motor vehicle insurance increased. 
That was the biggest advance in the so-called core CPI since January 2017 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in November. The core CPI increased 1.8 percent in the 12 months through December, picking up from 1.7 percent in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core CPI rising 0.2 percent month-on-month and holding steady at 1.7 percent on an annual basis. Weak import and producer price data this week had raised concerns about the inflation outlook, although the two reports do not have a strong correlation with the CPI. 
Economists are hoping that a tightening labor market, rising commodity prices, a weak dollar and fiscal stimulus will lift inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target this year. 
The central bank's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, has missed its target since May 2012. 
The dollar briefly trimmed losses against a basket of currencies after the CPI data, but later slumped to a four-month low on expectations that the European Central Bank would wind down its bond buying program this year. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest-rate sensitive two-year note rising to its highest since September 2008. Stocks on Wall street were trading higher.
BROAD PRICE INCREASES
Supporting the rise in underlying inflation pressures last month, rents increased 0.4 percent. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence climbed 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in November. 
The cost of medical care increased 0.3 percent, with prices for prescription medication surging 1.0 percent after rising 0.6 percent in November. The cost of both hospital and doctor visits increased 0.3 percent. The higher healthcare costs led economists to expect the core PCE price index probably rose 0.2 percent in December after nudging up 0.1 percent in November.
The government will release the December core PCE price index data later this month. 
Cheaper gasoline prices, however, limited the increase in the overall CPI to 0.1 percent in December after a 0.4 percent rise in November. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in November.
Last month, gasoline prices fell 2.7 percent after rebounding 7.3 percent in November. Food prices rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged for two straight months.
Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.9 percent in November. Retail sales increased 5.4 percent from a year earlier.
Sales last month were lifted by a 1.2 percent jump in receipts at gardening and building material stores and a 0.2 percent rise for auto dealerships. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.4 percent surge in November. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have gained 0.8 percent in November. Last month's increase in retail sales and the sharp upward revision to November data bolstered economists' expectations of an acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace during that period.
""The upward revisions to November and October put consumer spending on a stronger upward trajectory than we thought,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Another report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased 0.4 percent in November after being unchanged in October.

As a result of Friday's data, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by five-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent rate.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices rose 0.1% in December from a month earlier, below forecasts for a 0.2% increase and a 0.4% gain in the previous month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.1% last month, matching expectations and easing from the 2.2% advance seen in November.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, above expectations for a 0.2% advance and compared to November’s 0.1% rise.
Furthermore, core CPI also increased to an annualized rate of 1.8% in December, beating expectations that it would repeat the prior month’s reading of a 1.7% rise.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prospects that business investment in Britain will strengthen this year have been dealt an early blow by three surveys, none of which signaled improvement.
The surveys of lenders and businesses may disappoint Bank of England officials who expect the recovering global economy will lead to a modest strengthening of internal investment in 2018, even as the country heads for its exit from the European Union.
BoE Governor Mark Carney may not be too surprised, however. He has already said growth in business investment has not been as strong as it would normally be during a global upswing, an example of the economy's reduced ""speed limit"" from Brexit.
The surveys in the past week reinforced that message. 
Thursday's BoE Credit Conditions Survey showed lenders reported a hefty decrease in capital investment as a driver of demand for business loans during the fourth quarter.
Aside from the period immediately after the 2016 decision by voters to leave the European Union, it marked the sharpest fall in this measure in nearly six years.
This BoE gauge echoed the results from a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) in large British companies, published on Monday. 
The CFOs' expectations for capital investment across the British corporate sector cooled during the fourth quarter, remaining well below pre-Brexit vote levels. 
And finally, the British Chambers of Commerce's Quarterly Economic Survey - the largest non-official survey of businesses - showed no pick-up in investment intentions across services or manufacturing companies.
Joanna Davies, an economist with Fathom Consulting, said the surveys gave weight to her view that investment is unlikely to compensate for a continued squeeze in consumer spending, with inflation set to fall only slowly from near six-year highs struck recently.
Nor are exports likely to provide a large boost to economic growth, despite the pound's sharp depreciation after the Brexit vote, she added.
""I can't help but feel that the expected offset from weak sterling and the global upturn that we're experiencing elsewhere is being over-egged,"" she said. Fathom is the only forecaster among more than 30 in a Reuters poll published last month to predict a recession this year. [ECILT/GB]
In November the BoE said it expected business investment to expand by 2.75 percent in 2018, compared with around 2.5 percent last year. Investment growth between 2010 to 2015 averaged almost 5 percent a year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility is more pessimistic than the BoE, predicting business investment growth of 2.3 percent this year, down from 2.5 percent in 2017.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai military government's plan to expand the industrial east drew more than $9 billion in pledges of private investment last year and nearly $7 billion more is expected this year, the head of the state investment agency said on Friday.
The Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) is a centrepiece of the junta's policy to boost growth in Thailand and targets investment into hi-tech industries, as it transitions from those reliant on cheap labor. Thailand's economic growth has fallen behind other Southeast Asian economies since the 2014 coup.
The EEC drew 297 billion baht ($9.3 billion) in promised investment in 2017, Duangjai Asawachintachit, secretary-general of the Board of Investment told reporters. This year, it expects 216 billion baht in planned investment - or nearly a third of the total 720 billion baht Thailand expects to receive.
The junta, which has promised an election this year, says the project will revitalise an area whose industries have been flagging with a total $43 billion in public and private investment in the first five years.
The goal is to make the east a center for hi-tech industries such as robotics and electric vehicles as well as a regional hub for aircraft maintenance.
""In the past we relied on labor intensive industries, but these are hollowing out now. Some have moved to our neighbors,"" Kanit Sangsubhan, the secretary-general of the Eastern Economic Corridor Office, told Reuters.
To support growth, the government has approved $17 billion worth of infrastructure projects - including an upgrade of the Vietnam War era U-Tapao International Airport and Thailand's largest deep sea port.
Improved road and rail links will connect it with nearby Bangkok as well as the rest of mainland Southeast Asia and with China, to link up with Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.

Kanit said that once parliament passes new legislation for the project, probably in the first quarter of this year, it will be a draw for new investors.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Cheaper services weigh on U.S. wholesale prices; jobless claims up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December amid declining costs for services, which could temper expectations that inflation will accelerate in 2018.
Other data on Thursday showed initial claims for unemployment benefits increasing for the fourth straight week to more than a three-month high. That probably does not signal weakness in the labor market as the number of Americans receiving jobless benefits is at levels last seen in 1973. 
Bitter cold and snow in parts of the country likely kept some workers at home, accounting for last week's jump in jobless claims.
Weak wholesale prices could stoke fears that the causes of weak inflation will become more persistent and prompt the Federal Reserve to be more cautious about raising interest rates this year. 
""Factories aren't producing as much inflation, which is sure to bedevil the doves at the Fed who are worried about too low inflation,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Today's data strike at the heart of the argument over whether Fed officials should let the economy run hot for a while longer with a shallower path of rate hikes.""
The U.S. central bank is forecasting three rate hikes for 2018. It raised rates three times last year. 
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1 percent last month. That was the first drop in the PPI since August 2016 and followed two straight monthly increases of 0.4 percent.
In the 12 months through December, the PPI rose 2.6 percent after accelerating 3.1 percent in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 0.2 percent last month and increasing 3.0 percent from a year ago. 
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent last month. The so-called core PPI increased 0.4 percent in November. It rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months through December after increasing 2.4 percent in November. 
The PPI data came on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing a sharp moderation in import prices in December. While the correlation between those two reports and the consumer price index is weak, they underscore the challenge for the Fed to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.
Economists are hoping that a tightening labor market and recent weakness in the dollar will boost price pressures this year. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, has undershot its target since May 2012. 
The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies on the wholesale inflation data and expectations that the European Central Bank was preparing to reduce its monetary stimulus program. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose broadly.
SOLID LABOR MARKET
The price of services fell 0.2 percent in December after nine straight monthly rises. The decline reflected a 10.7 percent drop in margins for automotive fuels and lubricants retailing.
Wholesale food prices recorded their biggest drop since May, while energy prices were unchanged. The cost of healthcare services increased 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in November. Those costs feed into the core PCE price index.
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended Jan. 6, the highest level since late September. Economists had forecast claims falling to 245,000 in the latest week. 
A large part of the country faced frigid temperatures and snow during the first week of 2018, likely making it hard for some people to report for work. Unadjusted claims for New York rose by 27,170 last week, more than half of the national total.
Claims have risen since mid-December, though the data tend to be volatile during year-end holidays.
""We advise against extrapolating unless the rise is sustained in coming weeks,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
Last week marked the 149th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 35,000 to 1.87 million in the week ended Dec. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.

The 0.1 percent increase from October was shy of economists' expectations for a 0.2 percent gain. The new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums.
Ottawa, the country's capital, led the way with a 0.5 percent increase in prices as builders cited improved market conditions.
In Toronto, prices stalled for the fifth time in six months. Compared to a year ago, prices were up 4.7 percent, down from the year-over-year peak of 9.9 percent in April 2017, when the provincial government announced a number measures to cool the market in the city and surrounding area. 
Toronto home sales tumbled in 2017 in the wake of the Ontario rules, though the pace of sales picked up near the end of the year ahead of tighter mortgage rules that came into force at the start of 2018.

Prices were also unchanged on the month in Vancouver, Canada's most expensive market. Overall, monthly prices were up in 12 metropolitan areas surveyed, while three were down and 12 were unchanged.

There were 468,000 jobs open in the third quarter, up 15.1 percent from the third quarter of 2016. The vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.6 percent.
A higher job vacancy rate often points to economic growth. Canada's labor market saw unexpectedly robust gains in 2017 and contributed to the Bank of Canada's decision to raise rates twice last year. 
Openings for permanent positions accounted for 80.2 percent of all vacancies in the third quarter, up from 78.5 percent the year before.

The number of job openings also rose in nine out of the 10 largest industrial sectors. Vacancies rose 50 percent in the transportation sector as there was more demand for vehicle and transit drivers, while openings in food services and accommodation were up 13.6 percent.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended Jan. 6, the highest level since late September, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims have now risen for four straight weeks.
The increase likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions as claims data tend to be volatile during year-end holidays. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 245,000 in the latest week. 
A large part of the country was hit by frigid temperatures and snow during the first week of 2018, likely making it hard for some people to report for work. Unadjusted claims for New York increased by 27,170 last week, more than half of the national total. 
The Labor Department said claims data for Maine were estimated. It also said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands months after they were battered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, while claims processing in Puerto Rico was still not back to normal. 
Last week marked the 149th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 9,000 to 250,750. 
The continuing low level of claims suggests a strong labor market. The pace of job growth is, however, expected to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs in December after surging by 252,000 in November.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 35,000 to 1.87 million in the week ended Dec. 30, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 5,500 to 1.91 million.

The Labor Department said that the producer price index fell 0.1% last month.
In the 12 months through December, the PPI rose 2.6%.
Economist had expected the PPI to increase by 0.2% last month and by 3.0% from a year earlier.
Core PP, a gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs also fell by 0.1% last month and rose by 2.3% on a year-over-year basis.
Economists had forecast the core PPI increasing by 0.2% last month and by 2.5% from a year earlier.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.
Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
The dollar remained lower against a basket of currencies on the data, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, down 0.4% at 91.74."

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending January 6 increased by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 from the previous week’s total of 250,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop to 246,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended December 30 dropped to 1.867 million from 1.902 million in the preceding week which was revised down from an initial reading of 1.914 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to increase to 1.915 million.
The four-week moving average was 250,750, a gain of 9,000 from the previous week's reading of 241,750.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
After the report, which was published simultaneously with the producer price index, EUR/USD was trading at 1.2032 from around 1.2015 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3506 from 1.3492 earlier, while USD/JPY changed hands at 111.41 compared to 111.36 previously.

Last month the ECB left the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40%, respectively.
It also confirmed that its asset purchase program would be cut in half to €30 billion ($35.8 billion) a month starting in January and would continue, until the end of September or beyond if necessary.
“The risks surrounding the outlook for activity were assessed to have remained broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near-term,” the document revealed.
To the contrary, ECB members considered that risks to the global recovery remained “tilted to the downside”.
""Geopolitical uncertainties, as well as uncertainty regarding the policy outlook in some major economies, continued to constitute downside risks,"" the minutes showed, although members felt that those risks had generally diminished.
However, members expressed confidence that the euro area economic recovery had moved into expansionary territory.
ECB policymakers remained cautious about inflation but noted that there were somewhat positive signs from stronger wage dynamics “across a number of countries”.
“Overall, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate, with recent developments – while more positive than previously expected – generally seen to vindicate the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its meeting in late October,” the document showed.
Nevertheless, members widely agreed that future communications would require a gradual evolution.
“The language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in the coming year,” the minutes explained.
After the publication, the euro gained strength across the board, hitting intraday highs. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1992 from around 1.1939 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8897 from 0.8866 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded mixed. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 inched up 0.07%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.04%, France’s CAC 40 edged forward 0.07%, while London’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.13%."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy expanded at its fastest in six years in 2017 as its public finances posted a record surplus, fuelling expectations of another strong showing in 2018 and sharpening a political debate about how the windfall should be managed. 
Growth reached 2.2 percent last year, the federal statistics office said on Thursday. That missed a Reuters poll forecast of 2.4 percent but was still the highest since 2011, with consumer spending, boosted by ultra-low borrowing costs and record high employment, providing the biggest impetus.
Exports, the traditional driver of Europe's largest economy, also contributed as demand for 'made in Germany' goods picked up globally and in a euro zone experiencing its broadest recovery in a decade.
""Now it is about making sure that the economic shine continues into the future,"" said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank. ""Investments are needed. The next government has a big burden. It is time to take action instead of resting on laurels.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel conservatives are hoping to form a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), but she said on Thursday - the final day of exploratory talks that could lead to formal negotiations - that there were still high hurdles to clear.
Part of the debate is focused on whether the next government should cut taxes to boost the upswing, which Merkel's CSU/CDU alliance favours and which it has the fiscal wiggle room to do, or raise them to tame the risk of a bubble, as some conservative economists recommend. 
The SPD has suggested raising taxes on high earners to fund higher welfare spending.
Separate federal statistics data made clear the leeway available to trim the fiscal burden and increase spending.
The public sector, which includes the federal government, regional states, municipalities and social funds, posted a record budget surplus of 38.4 billion euros in 2017 after 25.7 billion euros in the previous year, it said.
PRICE PRESSURES
The buoyant economy is also increasing price pressures, and inflation last year grew at its fastest rate in five years.
That will feed into a heated debate among rate-setters at the European Central Bank (ECB), who need to decide whether still subdued price pressures in the bloc as a whole are rising enough to justify unwinding its asset easy money policies.
A breakdown of the GDP data showed capital investments were the second-largest growth driver, contributing 0.6 percentage points. Exports contributed 0.2 percentage points.

The positive economic picture contrasts with the political deadlock in Berlin, where Merkel - weakened by a poor showing by her conservatives in a national election in September - is hoping to conclude coalition talks by the end of March to secure a fourth term in office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices recorded their smallest increase in five months in December and underlying imported price pressures were muted amid declining costs for food and consumer goods.
The slowdown in import price growth came despite a weak dollar, which could temper expectations that inflation will pick up this year and keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases.
""Fed officials are desperate for more inflation and will take it from any quarter,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Today's import price data will worry the Fed doves even more about too-low inflation."" 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday import prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after accelerating 0.8 percent in November. That was the smallest gain since July and was well below economists' expectations for a 0.5 percent increase.
In the 12 months through December, prices increased 3.0 percent, slowing from November's 3.3 percent jump. The dollar lost 7 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners last year. 
Producer and consumer price reports on Thursday and Friday could offer fresh clues on the near-term inflation outlook.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target since May 2012. The Fed raised interest rates three times in 2017 and has forecast three rate hikes this year.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested a report from Bloomberg News that Chinese officials have recommended the country slow down or halt its purchases of U.S. securities. China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to a 10-month high, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
Last month, prices for imported petroleum rose 2.0 percent after surging 8.1 percent in November. Import prices excluding petroleum fell 0.2 percent, reversing a 0.2 percent gain in November. Import prices excluding petroleum rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through December.
""Our expectation for the dollar to decline further, along with another year of decent global growth, should lead non-fuel import prices to press higher this year,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, with goods accounting for only a quarter of core CPI, the lift to more closely watched measures of consumer price inflation should be modest.""
WHOLESALE INVENTORIES REBOUND
Imported capital goods prices were unchanged in December while the cost of food declined 0.7 percent.
The price of goods imported from China fell 0.1 percent in December after advancing 0.3 percent the prior month. Prices for imports from China dropped 0.2 percent in 2017 and have not recorded a calendar-year increase since 2011.
The cost of goods imported from Canada and Mexico was unchanged in December after rising 2.3 percent and 0.1 percent respectively in November.
The Labor Department also reported that export prices slipped 0.1 percent in December, declining for the first time since June, as agricultural prices fell for a second straight month. Export prices rose 0.5 percent in November.
They increased 2.6 percent year-on-year after rising 3.1 percent in November.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rebounded 0.8 percent in November, instead of 0.7 percent as estimated last month. That followed a 0.4 percent drop in October. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - also rose 0.8 percent in November, suggesting inventories could be a small drag on GDP in the fourth quarter. 
Inventory investment contributed almost eight-tenths of a percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.8 percent rate after the wholesale inventory data.

Sales at wholesalers shot up 1.5 percent in November after increasing 0.8 percent in October. At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.24 months to clear shelves, the fewest since November 2014, down from 1.25 months in October.

Economic growth slowed in the first nine months of 2017 as higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit vote hurt consumers, although exporters have gained from the weaker pound and the stronger euro zone economy.
Germany reported rapid growth in industrial output on Tuesday and stronger exports and its economy is forecast to grow faster than Britain's in 2017 and this year.
British industrial output rose by a monthly 0.4 percent in November, compared with 0.2 percent in October, spurring an annual rise of 2.5 percent. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected to see output rise 0.3 percent on the month and 1.8 percent on the year.
Manufacturing, which makes up the bulk of the industrial sector, enjoyed an especially strong three months to November, with output 3.9 percent higher than a year before, its biggest rise since March 2011.
""There was strong and widespread growth across manufacturing with notable increases from renewable energy projects, boats, planes and cars for export,"" ONS statistician Ole Black said.
The ONS said construction output in the three months to November dropped by 2.0 percent compared with the previous three months, the biggest decline since August 2012. Private housebuilding provided the only positive news.
Figures for the services sector - which is around eight times the size of manufacturing and has been growing slowly - are due to be released on Jan. 26.
Britain's economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent in the three months to September.
The Bank of England said in November it expected a repeat of that performance in the last three months of the year, after it raised its key interest rate for the first time since 2007.

After hitting a record peak in the third quarter of 2013, a string of government cooling measures drove private residential home prices down for 15 consecutive quarters through to the second quarter of this year.
That downturn may be over if optimistic forecasts by analysts are anything to go by, with a strong pick up on the cards after home prices edged up just 1.0 percent for the whole of 2017. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) forecast residential prices to rise 5-10 percent in 2018, and named UOL Group Ltd (SI:UTOS) as its top pick for stocks among Singapore developers.
""Particularly supportive of sustained property price increases is the breadth of household income growth and strong household balance sheets today,"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a note on Wednesday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) forecast an increase of 8 percent this year and said the pace could be sustained even in 2019, as it expects rising home buyer demand to outweigh a tight supply of unsold inventory. It named City Developments (SI:CTDM) as its top pick in a research note on Monday. 
If the forecasts stack up, the city state's economy could get an extra fillip from the expected pick up in construction activity, though there was scant data on the specific impact on output.
Jefferies expects a rise of low-to-mid single digits in residential prices in 2018.

Real estate services firm Colliers on Wednesday said average home prices may rise by 17 percent over 2018-2021, supported by higher economic growth, falling physical completions and ongoing collective sale deals.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",China's factory inflation slowest in 13 months as war on pollution steps up,"By Stella Qiu and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer prices rose at their slowest pace in 13 months in December, as the government's war against winter smog dented factory demand for raw materials in a sign the world's second largest economy has started to slow.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 4.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the slowest growth since November 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. That was slightly faster than the 4.8 percent in a Reuters poll of analyst but much weaker than the 5.8 percent pace seen in November.
The data also showed consumer inflation accelerating less than expected and remaining well within the central bank's comfort zone.
Analysts say the year-on-year slowdown in producer price inflation was due in part to a high base last year with price gains in raw materials falling from their peaks. It also supports the view that a softening in the economy has started in the last few months.
""Looking ahead, we think that food prices aside, inflation will continue to drop back in the coming quarters as economic activity softens,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
The data shows producer price increases slowing for the second month in a row in December, which follows a modest recovery in prices seen in the third quarter of last year.
A government crackdown on smog in the heavily industrialized northern provinces this year has hit demand for raw materials and continued curbs on the housing market have weighed on property investment.
While pollution curbs have had a disinflationary effect on producer prices, the resulting supply disruptions have in some segments added upward pressure to prices.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.8 percent in December, beating November's 0.5 percent increase, due to temporary disruptions caused by the pollution curbs.
The production restrictions at factories have triggered fears of supply shortages, giving a major boost to iron ore and steel futures prices and helping to offset tepid demand during winter months as construction activities slow.
""We'll have to see whether those price gains will be passed onto consumers in 2018,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications. 
Raw material prices rose 8.1 percent in December year-on-year, slowing from the 9.7 percent increase in November, data from the statistics bureau showed.
China's industrial firms reported seven-month low earnings for November as demand and producer price gains eased, adding more pressure on companies saddled with debt.
In December, consumer inflation accelerated less than expected to 1.8 percent from a year earlier versus 1.7 percent in November. The consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to edge up to 1.9 percent.
The food price index declined 0.4 percent in December after falling 1.1 percent in November. Non-food prices rose 2.4 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in November.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent a month earlier.
For 2017, CPI rose 1.6 percent, well within Beijing's annual target of 3 percent, while PPI surged 6.3 percent, ending a falling streak over the past five years.
""It's unlikely that CPI this year will surpass the government's comfort zone of 3 percent. I expect the central bank will stay put, under no pressure of resorting to monetary policy to contain modest inflation,"" Bank of Communications' Liu said.

China's economy is expected to have posted growth of 6.8 percent in 2017, up slightly from the previous year, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","UK economy set for 'underwhelming' 2018, says British Chambers of Commerce","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks set for an underwhelming 2018, according to a major survey on Wednesday that showed businesses are in a subdued mood ahead of Brexit.
Companies continued to grapple with cost pressures in the last three months of 2017 and were reluctant to invest more, the British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) Quarterly Economic Survey showed. 
The services sector, which represents the lion's share of Britain's economy, continued to expand at a subdued pace, the BCC said. Manufacturers did better than services firms, but still reported a slowdown in both domestic and export sales.
Overall the survey suggested the economy grew modestly at the end of last year, after picking up slightly in the three months to September with quarterly growth of 0.4 percent - below a historic trend of nearer 0.6 percent. 
""The economy is set to continue on an underwhelming growth trajectory over the near term with uncertainty over the impact of Brexit coupled with high inflation and weak productivity likely to dampen overall economic activity,"" the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said.
Economists polled by Reuters generally think the world's sixth-largest economy will expand modestly during 2018, underperforming most of its peers but doing better than the gloomy predictions made around the time of the shock vote to quit the European Union in mid-2016.
The survey of 7,000 companies - the largest of its type - showed the proportion of services companies reporting recruitment difficulties rose to 71 percent, the highest since records started in 1989.
The BCC warned that this could prove to be the biggest drag on businesses in 2018, and urged its members to train more staff, rather than simply complain about staff shortages.
More than a third of services companies expected to raise prices over the next three months, the most since late 2008.
That will concern Bank of England officials, since the BCC's gauges link well with official measures of producer prices that are a guide to future inflation pressure, even if past reports of skills shortages have not brought faster wage growth.
Last month the BoE said inflation was likely to fall slowly in 2018. Consumer price inflation rose to its highest in nearly six years in November at 3.1 percent. 
The central bank also anticipates a further improvement in business investment in 2018. 
But the BCC survey showed no sign of a firm upswing in investment plans among either services or manufacturing companies, similar to a Deloitte survey of major company bosses out earlier this week.

Official data for industrial and construction output in November, as well as trade, are due at 0930 GMT.

Inflation stood at 6.77 percent in the year to December, the highest annual rate since the 12 months to May 2001, according to data published on Tuesday by the national statistics agency.
That was slightly higher than a Reuters poll of economists that expected inflation at year-end to accelerate to 6.75 percent from 6.63 percent in November.
Inflation surged after the liberalization of gasoline prices at the start of last year, though governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said on Sunday the rate should slow in January as that factor fades from the consumer price index.
The rise in inflation for Latin America's second-biggest economy ""will probably lead to further calls for Banxico to raise rates again,"" at its next policy meeting, Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at London-based Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
Banco de Mexico (Banxico) is next due to decide monetary policy on Feb. 8.
Minutes from the Dec. 14 meeting reinforced a more hawkish tone under new boss Diaz de Leon, with some board members saying further rate increases may be needed to contain price pressures.
The volatile peso, a likely deterioration of inflation expectations, and risks to the economy associated with the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as well as a presidential election in Mexico this year make a rate hike next month ""a significant probability,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos.
Yields on Mexican interest rate swaps  ticked higher after the inflation data as investors firmed bets on another 25 basis points interest rate hike in February. 
Ramos predicted a hike to 7.50 percent at the bank's February meeting, following the December one-quarter percentage point increase to 7.25 percent - unless the next inflation reading was positive or the next round of NAFTA negotiations have a peso-supporting outcome. 
Consumer prices  rose 0.59 percent in December, a six-year high for that month, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures.
The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.42 percent during the month .

Mexico's central bank targets inflation of 3 percent. Its board said recently it expects the rate to reach that goal slower than it had previously predicted.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings, layoffs fall to six-month lows in November","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell for a second straight month in November, with declines in the manufacturing and real estate sectors, supporting economist forecasts that job growth will slow in 2018.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday, also found that layoffs dropped to a six-month low, however, showing continued labor market strength.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell by 46,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.88 million, the lowest level since May. The job openings rate was 3.8 percent, a decline from October's 3.9 percent.
""The recent declines followed a sharp run up over the first three quarters of 2017,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""If sustained, this suggests a more moderate pace of hiring ahead.""
Hiring dropped 104,000 to 5.49 million in November, and the hiring rate dipped to 3.7 percent from 3.8 percent. Economists expect job growth this year to slow to well below the 2017 monthly average of 170,000 as the labor market hits full employment. 
The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and economists expect it to drop to 3.5 percent by the end of 2018. Non-farm payrolls rose 148,000 in December.
""Like the recent readings on payrolls and initial claims, we see some moderation in the labor market data off of strong levels,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York.
There were 378,000 job openings in manufacturing in November, down from 409,000 in October. The transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector saw a 60,000 drop in job openings. There was a 39,000 decline in job openings in the real estate and rental and leasing sector.
But job openings in the troubled retail sector increased 88,000 in November. The sector lost 67,000 jobs in 2017 as retailers, reeling from stiff competition from online sellers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), closed stores. 
The JOLTS report also showed layoffs decreasing 7,000 to 1.67 million in November. That was the lowest level since May and marked five straight months of declines. 
There was a slight drop in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, leaving the quits rate unchanged at 2.2 percent for a third straight month. The Federal Reserve looks at the quits rate as a measure of job market confidence.

""The low turnover rates indicate that there is less movement in the labor market than at other times when we've had very low unemployment,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""It is great for the labor market to be near full employment, but if workers are staying put, then there is little pressure for employers to raise wages.""

Analysts had expected the number of job openings to increase to 6.038 million in November from the previous month.
The report has garnered more attention despite the lag on the data, as outgoing Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has cited the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.
Additionally, the release noted that, over the month, hires and separations were little changed at 5.5 million and 5.2 million, respectively.
Within separations, the quits rate was unchanged at 2.2% and the layoffs and discharges rate was little changed 1.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1924 from around 1.1925 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.3512 compared to 1.3514 previously, while USD/JPY was at 112.69 from 112.76 earlier.

Even greater differences were seen in youth unemployment numbers, Germany leading with 6.6 percent and Greece having the highest number at 39.5 percent, followed by Spain at 37.9 percent and Italy at 32.7 percent.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Industrial production and exports from Germany rose more than expected in November, prompting the government to raise its estimate of growth for 2017 and signaling that its expansion would carry on this year.
Industrial output jumped 3.4 percent for the month, the biggest increase since September 2009, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Tuesday, overshooting a 1.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.
Seasonally adjusted exports for November rose 4.1 percent on the month and domestic demand pushed imports up 2.3 percent. Both figures beat Reuters forecasts, and they widened the trade surplus to 22.3 billion euros ($26.61 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October.
The figures and buoyant business sentiments suggest ""that the German economy ended 2017 with a bang after the third quarter's impressive 0.8 percent expansion,"" Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
Soon after the data, the government raised its 2017 growth forecast to 2.2 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent.
""The economy is stable,"" Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said. ""And we assume that it will continue at about the same level.""
A BRIGHT 2018
The economy has expanded every year for the past eight years, and it has continued to surge even though Chancellor Angela Merkel has failed to form a new coalition government after September's national election, creating a political deadlock. 
The rise in November's output confirmed economists' assumption that a 1.2 percent drop in October was caused by limited factors, namely two public holidays.
A breakdown of the output data showed the main drivers were capital and consumer goods spending as well as construction. 
The Statistics Office will publish on Thursday full-year gross domestic product figures for 2017, which are forecast to show 2.4 percent growth. Some analysts expect it to do better.

""German GDP looks set to have risen by slightly more than our above-consensus forecast of 2.5 percent in 2017 and we expect a similarly strong pace of growth this year,"" McKeown said.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Inflation-squeezed British shoppers cut back on almost everything other than food in the last three months of 2017, leading to the biggest fall in non-grocery spending since 2009, industry figures showed on Tuesday.
British inflation rose to its highest in nearly six years in November at 3.1 percent, largely as a result of the pound's fall after June 2016's Brexit vote, and many consumer-facing businesses have been coming under increased pressure.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents large chains, said overall spending in the last three months of 2017 rose by a sluggish 1.1 percent, compared with an average annual growth rate of 1.7 percent for 2017 as a whole.
""Growth in spending was in line with the average for the year. However, the divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Non-food sales fell by 1.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, the biggest drop since March 2009, while food sales grew by 4.2 percent, the biggest jump since June.
Visa said on Monday that a broader measure of consumer spending fell in December for the first time since 2012.
The BRC said clothing sales did better last month than a year earlier, helped by colder-than-normal weather, while jewelry and toys underperformed compared with the year before.
This partly mirrors trading statements from major retailers.  Next  (L:NXT), the country's biggest clothing store, and discount food retailer Aldi UK reported strong sales, but department store  Debenhams  (L:DEB) cut profit forecasts. 
British retail sales data has become harder to interpret in the past couple of years due to signs that some spending may be shifting earlier in the festive period to take advantage of Black Friday discounts in late November.
Britain's biggest credit card provider, Barclaycard (L:BARC), said consumer spending between Nov. 19 and Dec. 23 was 4.0 percent higher than a year earlier, the sharpest rise in eight months. This period covered Black Friday, and Barclaycard also includes spending at places like hotels, pubs and restaurants, which is growing much faster than retail spending.

By contrast, the BRC said retail spending in the Nov. 26-Dec. 30 period was up just 1.4 percent on a year earlier, and only rose by 0.6 percent when changes in shop floor space are adjusted for.

The Commission's economic sentiment indicator rose to 116.0 points in December from 114.6 in November and well above the 114.8 point expectation in a Reuters poll. 
It was the highest value of the indicator since October 2000. The record was the 119.0 set in May 2000.
Separately, the Commission's business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, reached the highest value since measurements began in 1985, hitting 1.66, up from 1.49 in November.
Sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro was buoyed by a rise in optimism across all sectors -- in industry, services, retail trade, construction as well as services.
But the upbeat mood, while pushing up producer price expectations among manufacturers, has failed to increase consumer inflation expectations which are key to boost inflation to the European Central Bank target of below, but close to 2 percent. Inflation eased to 1.4 percent last month from 1.5 percent in November.
The monthly Commission survey showed that consumers' inflation expectation for the next 12 months fell to a four-month low o f13.6 points in December from 16.0 in November.
The slow price growth, which comes despite the euro zone's strongest economic growth in a decade, may vindicate the ECB's decision to keep its monetary policy easy despite growing pressure from Germany and other richer euro zone countries.
The ECB has said it would continue buying bonds at least until September and keep low interest rates ""well past"" then to raise inflation to its two percent target even though policymakers from the Netherlands, Germany and other northern countries have voiced their worries about an overly easy policy while economic growth is strong.

Capital Economics said in a note that, while there might be upside risks to its already above-consensus forecast of 2.3 percent economic growth this year in the euro zone, this would probably not prompt the ECB to adopt its dovish stance.

Sentix's index for the euro zone, based on a survey of 929 investors, rose to 32.9 in January from 31.1 in December. That beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 31.5 and came after a hefty fall at the end of last year.
A subindex tracking the current situation hit its highest level since August 2007.
""The economy in all regions of the world is looking stable and positive and is showing moderate improvements,"" the Frankfurt-based research firm said, adding that this applied to regions including the euro zone, eastern Europe and Latin America.
""The upturn is therefore broad and synchronous. The likelihood of possible overheating is rising,"" Sentix added.
It said businesses did not seem to be bothered by the absence of a new coalition in Germany, Europe's largest economy, which has been managed by a caretaker government since a September election.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempts to form a three-way coalition last year failed but she began talks with the Social Democrats (SPD) on Sunday and said she was optimistic they could agree to form a coalition government.
The parties, which are likely to clash on immigration, tax, healthcare and Europe, expect to announce on Thursday whether they will open full-blown coalition talks.
An index tracking Germany increased to 40.1 in January from 39.1 the previous month.
Rather than focusing on the lack of a new government, investors are beginning to assess the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tax reforms, which is enhancing companies' profits and is likely to boost demand for capital goods, Sentix said.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a tax reform into law in December which slashes the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent for 35 percent. Sentix said that was pushing up U.S. economic expectations.

Notching up their 11th straight month of gains, reserves rose $20.2 billion in December to $3.14 trillion, the highest since September 2016 and the biggest monthly increase since July. That compares with an increase of $10 billion in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion. 
Capital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.
The yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation.
For the full year, China's FX reserves rose $129.5 billion from $3.011 trillion at the end of 2016. That's the first annual rise since 2014.
China's foreign exchange regulator said in a statement on its website that it would keep the nation's forex reserves and international balance of payments ""balanced and stable"" in 2018.
The country's reserves dropped by nearly $1 trillion from a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014 to $2.998 trillion in January 2017 as it sought to shore up the yuan and reduce potentially destabilizing capital outflows. But reserves have since climbed by $142 billion.
Despite the improved capital flow picture, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange has continued a clampdown on the movements of funds abroad. The regulator announced last month it would cap overseas withdrawals by people using domestic Chinese bank cards starting this year.
Some major global acquisitions by Chinese firms have also been put on ice by regulators, who fear they are really intended to disguise movements of capital offshore, though Beijing has maintained genuine investments will still be approved.
China's central bank reported net foreign exchange buying for the third consecutive month in November, marking a policy victory for the authorities after a long battle to stabilize the yuan, although analysts say capital flows are likely to remain volatile as the economy slows.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the yuan to depreciate slightly this year if the dollar firms.

The value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the People's Bank of China's website showed.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 02:56PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth cools as labor market nears full employment; wages up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pick-up in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 148,000 last month after a surge of 252,000 in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. Retail payrolls fell by 20,300 in December, the largest drop since March, despite reports of a strong holiday shopping season. 
The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 190,000 in December. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""We do not think that today's employment report will keep the Federal Reserve from tightening again at the March policy meeting, given other strong recent economic data,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Job growth surged in October and November after being held back in September by back-to-back hurricanes, which destroyed infrastructure and homes and temporarily dislocated some workers in Texas and Florida. 
Taking the sting out of the moderation in job gains, average hourly earnings rose 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, in December after a 0.1 percent gain in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent, from 2.4 percent in November.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell on the employment report while the dollar (DXY) rose marginally against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. 
Employment gains in December were below the monthly average of 204,000 over the past three months. Job growth is slowing as the labor market nears full employment, but could get a temporary boost from a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. 
The lift from the fiscal stimulus, which includes a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is likely to be modest as the stimulus is occurring with the economy operating almost at capacity. There are also concerns the economy could overheat.
NEAR FULL EMPLOYMENT
Data ranging from housing to manufacturing and consumer spending have suggested solid economic growth in the fourth quarter, despite a widening of the trade deficit in both October and November, which could subtract from gross domestic product.
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the trade gap widened 3.2 percent in November to $50.5 billion, the highest level since January 2012.
The deficit was boosted by record high imports, which offset the highest exports in three years. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
For all of 2017, the economy created 2.1 million jobs, below the 2.2 million added in 2016. It was the seventh year in a row that the economy generated more than 2 million jobs. 
Economists expect job growth this year to slow to well below the 2017 monthly average of 170,000 as the labor market hits full employment, which will likely boost wage growth as employers compete for workers. 
""Almost every person ready, able and willing to work now has a job,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPM Asset Management in New York. ""Meeting the labor demand of 2018 will require hiring those less willing, and enticing them into the labor market will probably require stronger wage growth.""
Economists are optimistic that annual wage growth will top 3.0 percent by the end of this year. The unemployment rate declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point last year. 
The jobless rate for African-Americans fell to a record low of 6.8 percent in December. 
Economists believe the overall unemployment rate could drop to 3.5 percent by the end of this year, which would be the lowest since the late 1960s. That could potentially unleash a faster pace of wage growth and translate into a much stronger increase in inflation than currently anticipated. 
That, according to economists, would force the Fed to push through four interest rate increases this year instead of the three it has penciled in. The U.S. central bank raised borrowing costs three times in 2017. 
Employment gains were largely broad-based in December. Construction payrolls increased by 30,000 jobs, the most since February, reflecting recent strong increases in homebuilding. Manufacturing employment increased by 25,000 jobs. 
Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and a weakening dollar. Employment in the utilities sector fell for a second straight month. 
General merchandise stores payrolls tumbled by 27,300 in December, with employment at clothing stores dropping by 3,800 jobs. For all of 2017, retail employment dropped by 67,000 jobs after rising by 203,000 in 2016. 
Further job losses are likely this year as major retailers, facing stiff competition from online sellers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), close stores.
Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) said on Thursday it was shuttering 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores.  Macys  Inc (N:M) also announced 11 store closures, which could leave 5,000 workers unemployed.

""Employment in retail trade is now the lowest it has been in almost 50 years as a percentage of total employment, and there is nothing to suggest that trend will reverse,"" said Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 11:19AM ET</span>",U.S. services sector on track for growth in 2018: ISM's Nieves,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. services industries are expected to expand in 2018, though perhaps not at a pace as fast as the 12-year high set in October, Anthony Nieves, chair of the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing business survey committee, said on Friday.
""You are still seeing growth,"" Nieves said on a conference call with reporters after ISM released its non-manufacturing activity data for December earlier. ""It may not be as strong as October.""
Earlier Friday, the ISM gauge on the vast U.S. services sector unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December to 55.9 from 57.4 in November. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a December reading of 57.6.
A reading above 50 suggests the services sector is expanding.
The ISM services index recorded a reading above 50 for 96 consecutive months, signaling the U.S. economy was growing at a 2.7 percent annualized pace.

830,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 10:15AM ET</span>", U.S. ISM Services PMI Falls More Than Expected in December,"Investing.com - Service sector activity in the U.S. fell more than expected in December, dampening optimism over the American economy, industry data showed on Friday.
In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) decreased to 55.9 in December from the prior month’s reading of 57.4.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to only 57.8 last month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The numbers show that the sector is growing at a slower rate, said Anthony Nieves, chair of the Institute for Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.
""There has been a second consecutive month of pullback in the rate of growth,"" he said. ""Overall, the majority of respondents’ comments indicate that they finished the year on a positive note. They also indicate optimism for business conditions and the economic outlook going forward.""
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index decreased to 57.3 last month, 4.1 points below November’s reading of 61/4 and also below the consensus forecast of 61.0.
The New Orders Index registered 54.3 in December, lower than the reading of 58.7 in the previous month.
The Employment Index rose to 56.3 last month from November’s reading of 55.3.
The Prices Index inched forward to 60.8 in December from the prior month’s reading of 60.7.
Following the report,the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was trading at 91.79 from 91.80 earlier.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets rose after the open. The S&P 500 rose six points or 0.35% while the Dow composite increased 62 points or 0.25% to 25,060.88 and tech heavy NASDAQ Composite was up 25 points or 0.36%."
831,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit rises to near six-year high on record imports,"Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased more than expected in November as imports of goods surged to a record high amid strong domestic demand, making it likely that trade will subtract from economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap widened 3.2 percent to $50.5 billion. That was the highest level since January 2012 and followed an upwardly revised $48.9 billion shortfall in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit increasing to $49.5 billion in November after a previously reported $48.7 billion deficit in the prior month.
Part of the rise in the trade deficit in November reflected price increases. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $66.7 billion from $65.6 billion in October. The so-called real trade deficit for October and November was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion.
That suggests trade will probably subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter. The chronic trade deficit has garnered the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth.
The government reported last month that trade contributed 0.36 percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes that a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.
Imports of goods jumped to a record high of $204.0 billion in November. Capital goods imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods rose to their highest level since March 2015. The strong growth in imports is being driven by robust consumer demand.
The country's import bill was also pushed up by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest since January 2015.

Imports from China were unchanged in November. Exports of goods increased 2.3 percent to $200.2 billion in November, the highest on record. There were strong increases in exports of industrial supplies, petroleum and capital goods.
Overall exports of goods are being supported by recent dollar depreciation and a strengthening global economy, which is helping to underpin the manufacturing sector.
Exports to China fell 1.9 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 0.6 percent to $35.4 billion in November.

The Statistics Canada report showed that the Canadian unemployment rate fell to 5.7% in December, its lowest rate since 2007, compared to 5.9% the month prior. Analysts had expected it to rise to 6.0%.
The Canadian economy created 78,600 jobs last month, compared to 79,500 jobs in November. Economists had expected the creation of 1,000 jobs.

833,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Job Creation Disappoints in December; Wage Inflation In Line,"Investing.com – The U.S monthly employment report showed that the economy created fewer jobs than expected in December, according to official data released on Friday.
Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 148,000 in December, compared to the creation of 252,000 posts a month earlier that was revised up from the initial gain of 228,000.
The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 190,000 jobs, and was lower than 250,000 that the ADP report indicated a earlier.
However, the jobless rate met expectations by holding steady at 4.1%
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.3% month-on-month in December, in line with forecasts and compared to the prior 0.1% increase which was revised down from an initial 0.2% advance.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.5% in December, that was in line with forecasts for it to remain stable with prior month’s reading.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer of the new job contracts than expected in December with a total of 146,000, compared to consensus expectations for 185,000. November’s number was revised to an increase of 239,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of the destruction of 221,000 jobs.
Government payrolls increased by 2,000 last month, compared to the 13,000 public jobs created in November, revised from an initial increase of 7,000 positions. December’s reading missed forecasts for the creation of 5,000 government posts.
The participation rate remained unchanged at 62.7% in December.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, increased to 8.1% from the November’s reading of 8.0%.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours held stable at 34.5 December, in line with expectations.
After the report, the dollar weakened, heading into negative territory against major rivals. Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index traded at 91.54, compared to 91.80 ahead of the report. EUR/USD traded at 1.2071, from 1.2045 before the publication, USD/JPY traded at 113.06, from 113.29 earlier, and GBP/USD was at 1.3577, compared to 1.3551 previously.
U.S. futures still pointed to a higher open on Wall Street. The blue-chip Dow futures gained 91 points, or 0.36%, S&P 500 futures rose 10 points, or 0.37% while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 33 points, or 0.50%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,321.10 a troy ounce, compared to $1,319.00 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $61.49 a barrel from $61.31 earlier."
834,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",UK productivity growth hits six-year high after weakest decade since 1820s,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic productivity perked up in the three months to the end of September, growing at its fastest rate in more than six years, in contrast to its historically weak performance over the previous decade.
Productivity in Britain has stagnated since the global financial crisis even more than in most other advanced economies, and has played a key role in squeezing Britons' living standards.
Over the past 10 years productivity growth was the weakest since modern records began and appears to be the slowest since the early 1820s, when Britain was emerging from the Napoleonic wars, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. 
During the third quarter of 2017, output per hour worked grew by 0.9 percent compared with the three months before, its first rise since late 2016 and the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2011, the ONS said.
However, the upturn reflected a fall in the number of people in work over the period rather than strong economic growth, which was a lackluster 0.4 percent.
Britain's economy slowed last year, despite strong global growth, as the plunge in the pound that followed its 2016 vote to leave the European Union triggered higher inflation that hurt consumer spending.
The uncertainty generated by Brexit has also weighed on businesses' willingness to invest.
UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK
Productivity dropped in the first half of 2017 as businesses hired staff faster than they increased output. Compared with a year before, third-quarter productivity was just 0.8 percent higher, less than half its pre-crisis growth rate.
Late last year Britain's government forecasters revised down their long-run productivity forecasts to around 1 percent a year, after previous expectations for it to pick up to nearer 2 percent were repeatedly disappointed.
A weaker productivity outlook also drove the BoE's decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, as it judged the economy would struggle to grow much faster than 1.5 percent a year without creating excessive inflation.
That said, Friday's data showed unit labor costs - a measure of how much it costs to produce a given amount of output, and a key driver of inflation - rose by the least since the second quarter of 2015, increasing 1.3 percent.
Howard Archer, an economist at forecasters EY ITEM Club, said productivity was likely to have recovered further in the final three months of 2017. Early indications suggest growth remained solid while the number of people in work fell.
But he was less positive about the longer term.
""A major risk is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK's economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity,"" he said.
Britain's government has launched repeated efforts to boost productivity, and says past weakness is partly due to strong job creation, which has pushed unemployment to its lowest in more than 40 years.

ONS data also show a drag from the declining North Sea oil and gas sector, and from heavy losses in financial services after the global crisis. Low investment and inconsistent management quality also weigh on productivity, economists say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to increase interest rates in March.
Other data on Thursday showed a third straight weekly rise in first-time applications for unemployment benefits, though that probably reflected volatility around the end-of-year holidays. 
The Labor Department said claims data for some states, including California, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Virginia, had been estimated. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
""Higher jobless claims are not signaling a slowdown in the economy, that's for sure,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The labor market looks strong and the outlook for 2018 is even better.""
The ADP Research Institute said private payrolls increased by 250,000 jobs in December, the biggest gain since March, and well above economists' expectations for a rise of 190,000. 
The ADP National Employment Report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.
The gains in employment were broad-based last month. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 9,000 and employment in the construction sector increased by 16,000. The service-providing industries added another 222,000 jobs last month.The ADP report was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 190,000 jobs in December after a gain of 228,000 in November.
The tightening labor market encouraged the Fed to raise interest rates three times last year despite inflation persistently undershooting the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.
Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 12-13 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials upbeat about the economy and labor market prospects. They viewed economic activity as ""rising at a solid rate,"" and the labor market as continuing to strengthen.[nW1N1LO001]
The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for 2018. Some economists, however, expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs four times this year, citing the impact of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed by the Republican-led Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.
LAYOFFS DECLINE
In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced 32,423 job cuts in December, a 7.4 percent decrease from November. That brought the total number of layoffs in 2017 to 418,770, the fewest since 1990. Employers announced 526,915 job cuts in 2016.
The dollar rose against the yen and trimmed losses versus the euro after the ADP report. Major stock indexes on Wall Street hit fresh record highs in early morning trading, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. 
In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 250,000 for the week ended Dec. 30. 
Last week marked the 148th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased by 3,500 to 241,750 last week.
""Seasonal adjustment is especially challenging around year-end,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ""Through the volatility, the data continue to signal strength in employment growth.""

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 37,000 to 1.91 million in the week ended Dec. 23. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose by 750 to 1.92 million.

Britain's economy saw lackluster growth for most of 2017 - especially compared to its faster-growing neighbors - and Thursday's BoE data suggest this pattern continued toward the end of the year.
The central bank said unsecured consumer lending in the three months to November grew at an annualized rate of 8.5 percent, down from 9.3 percent in the three months to October and its weakest since June 2015. 
The BoE has played down any suggestion of a debt bubble, though it has acknowledged pockets of risk and required banks to set aside more money against the risk of bad loans. 
In cash term, borrowing was up by 1.4 billion pounds in November alone, compared with economists' forecasts of a 1.5 billion pound rise in a Reuters poll.
Net mortgage approvals for house purchase were at the higher end of economists' forecasts at 65,139 in November compared with 64,887 in October.
Earlier on Thursday major mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices overall last year grew at their slowest pace since 2012 and fell in London for the first time since 2009.
The central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November, reversing a cut made in August 2016, and indicated that further increases were likely in the coming years to keep inflation under control.
Figures last week from industry group UK Finance showed mortgage approvals by major banks dropped to a 15-month low. 
Consumer credit growth has been slowing gradually since it peaked at nearly 11 percent in November 2016. 
With Britain's consumers being squeezed by slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, expectations for Christmas spending had been subdued.

However, major clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) reported stronger than expected Christmas sales on Wednesday and the Confederation of British Industry said sales growth had been solid in the early part of December.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's dominant services sector grew unexpectedly quickly last month and businesses are more upbeat about 2018 than they were for much of 2017, but Brexit is weighing on investment plans, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS service Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.2 in December, its second-highest reading since April, beating forecasts in a Reuters poll that it would remain at November's 53.8.
Along with surveys of construction and manufacturing published this week, the economy looks as if it grew 0.4 to 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2017, faster than in the previous quarter, IHS Markit said.
Official data for most of 2017 showed Britain lagging behind other countries with the weakest year-on-year growth since 2013 in the third quarter. Consumer spending took a hit from high inflation caused by the 2016 Brexit vote and slow wage growth.
However, British retailers - who are not included in the PMI - have so far reported solid sales over the Christmas period.
Major clothing chain  Next  (L:NXT) said on Wednesday that colder-than-usual weather had given an extra boost to demand.
Thursday's PMI data showed that services firms were upbeat about 2018. More than 40 percent expect stronger sales this year, and just 10 percent see a fall, the most optimistic split since May.
""However, as has been increasingly the case in recent months, the good news comes with a health warning about the sustainability of the upturn,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief economist.
The inflow of new orders slowed to its weakest since August 2016, partly due to worries about the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union in March 2019, IHS Markit said.
""Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signaled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment,"" Williamson said.
The survey showed companies hired people at the slowest rate since March 2017, while input costs rose at their fastest in three months.
""There were also reports that uncertainty about the path to Brexit continued to weigh on growth, particularly in terms of clients' willingness to commit to new projects,"" Markit said.

The survey was conducted from Dec. 5 to 19, so included responses both before and after Prime Minister Theresa May gained agreement from the EU to move Brexit talks on to discuss transitional arrangements and a longer-term trade deal.

Research group IHS Markit reported that its purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November, compared to forecast for a reading of 54.1.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Firms reported that new order growth eased to 16-month low amid concerns over Brexit, while the rate of job creation slipped to a nine-month low. Input costs rose at the fastest rate in three months, the report said.
""However, as has been increasingly the case in recent months, the good news comes with a health warning about the sustainability of the upturn,"" said Chris Williamson,chief economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signaled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment,"" he added.
The report came after similar surveys earlier in the week showed that growth in the UK manufacturing sector cooled last month from four-year highs struck in November, but remained solid.
Meanwhile, growth in the construction sector slowed last month for the first time since September.
Taking the three sector surveys together, Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly rate of around 0.4% to 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, survey compiler IHS Markit said."

The euro zone economy closed out the year with the strongest growth in nearly seven years, driven by accelerating services and manufacturing activity across all major economies, a survey showed on Thursday.
The news will put pressure on the European Central Bank to close out its aggressive stimulus this year, and coincides with the central bank's decision to halve its monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros starting this month.
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index - seen as a good overall growth indicator for the euro zone - rose to 58.1 in December from 57.5 in November and up slightly from the flash estimate of 58.0.
It is now at its highest since February 2011 and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""A stellar end to 2017 for the euro zone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
The average composite euro zone PMI reading for 2017, 56.4, was the best annual trend since 2006, Williamson noted -- just before the financial crisis.
The data suggested fourth-quarter economic growth of 0.8 percent, faster than many other developed-market economies and exceeding the median forecast of 0.6 percent in a Reuters poll last month.
Based on forward-looking indicators within the PMI release, the momentum is set to continue. The composite new orders index climbed to 58.0 last month - its highest since July 2007 - from 57.3. That demand pushed companies to add staff; hiring growth matched a 17-year record high set in November.
Euro zone unemployment peaked at 12.1 percent in the first half of 2013. It has now declined to 8.8 percent.
The services PMI, which is part of the composite, soared to its highest in more than six years, 56.6, up from 56.2 in November. That followed a report on Tuesday showing the manufacturing PMI climbed to its highest in more than two decades of survey data.
But price pressure eased, a disappointing development for the ECB, which has been struggling to boost inflation. The rate of increases in input costs and what business charge consumers slowed for the first time in five months. Still, inflationary pressures remain at levels not seen in over six years.
""Based on past experience, the extent to which demand appears to be outstripping supply for many goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures could continue to build in the coming months,"" noted Williamson.
""A big question for 2018 will therefore be whether relatively high unemployment and spare capacity in many

countries will continue to hold down pay growth and keep a ceiling on consumer price inflation.""

Markit's final services index rose to 55.8 from 54.3 in November, helped by a sharper increase in new business in all sections of the sector.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 58.9 from 57.3 in November to reach an 80-month high. The flash composite reading was 58.7.
Markit's final PMI for manufacturing showed on Tuesday that factory growth jumped to an all-time high of 63.3 in December from 62.5 in November.
""2017 was a year to remember for the German economy, and it's encouraging to see that it ended on a high for the service sector as well as manufacturing,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.

""The upturn in growth in the more locally focused service sector in December provides evidence of stronger domestic demand helping accelerate the pace of economic expansion,"" he said, adding that the survey pointed to growth of at least 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD UAE Purchasing Managers' Index, which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 57.7 last month from 57.0 in November. Above 50 indicates expansion and below shows a contraction.
Output growth fell sharply last month to 60.7 from 64.3 but remained strong by historical standards, while growth in new orders rose sharply to a 35-month high of 64.8 from 60.1.
Employment continued to grow at the same moderate pace.
""The UAE's non-oil sector expanded sharply in the last two months of the year, largely due to a strong rise in output and new orders,"" said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.
""It is likely that the introduction of VAT in January has spurred activity and purchasing in the fourth quarter of 2017,
which is in line with our expectations. Nevertheless, employment and wage growth have been relatively muted, not just in December but for 2017 as a whole.""

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index edged down to 57.3 last month from a two-year high of 57.5 in November. A level above 50 means business is expanding.
Budget data released by the government in mid-December showed that after more than two years of austerity, state spending jumped in the fourth quarter of 2017 as authorities sought to strengthen weak economic growth.
Spending in the fourth quarter was about 354 billion riyals ($94 billion), by far the largest amount in any quarter of 2017 and accounting for 38 percent of all state spending for the entire year. Much of the government money eventually flowed into the private sector, boosting activity.
""The December PMI survey continued to show a strong rate of expansion in December, and the data suggests that non-oil growth accelerated in the final quarter of 2017, as well as for the year as a whole compared to 2016,"" said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.
""Nevertheless, we expect headline GDP growth to be close to zero in 2017 as substantial oil production cuts will offset the expansion in the non-oil sectors of the economy. We are more optimistic about growth prospects in 2018, however.” 
Output growth slowed to 62.8 in December from 64.3 in November, while growth in new orders eased to 63.2. Employment growth sped up slightly to 50.9, however.

The median forecast from 10 economists surveyed was for exports in November to expand 13.9 percent from a year ago, down from the 18.9 percent growth in October.
Individual estimates ranged between 9.2 percent and 17.2 percent.
Malaysia has enjoyed double-digit growth in exports over the past 11 months, peaking at 32.5 percent in May 2017.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",China's services sector growth at more than three year-high in December: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector activity expanded at its fastest pace in over three years in December on solid growth in new business, with the outlook improving to a six-month high, a private sector survey showed on Thursday.
The upbeat findings broadly echo those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector last week that showed activity accelerated at a faster rate in December than the previous month, reinforcing the view that an expected slowdown in the broader economy would be gradual.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in December, from 51.9 in November and the highest reading since August 2014. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth, and a reading below signals contraction on a monthly basis.
New business increased at the fastest pace since May 2015, with survey respondents reporting sales supported by strong underlying client demand and new projects.
China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance economic expansion from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.
The services sector accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
The survey also showed input price inflation for services firms in China in December matched March's reading at 53.8, higher at 51.7 in November.
Companies were able to pass through higher input costs to clients, though at a slightly slower pace than in November. 
A similar private sector survey of manufacturers on Tuesday also suggested input costs remained high, fueled by China's government's tougher pollution measures in a battle against thick winter smog.
That report showed the manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace in four months as firms cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders. 
Driven by strong readings in both the services and manufacturing sectors, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI rose to 53.0 in December, compared to 51.6 in November and the highest in a year.
""Expansions in total new orders and new export business supported optimism among manufacturers and service providers towards the business outlook for next year,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report. 
""Although China's economic growth remains under downward pressure, it is still resilient. However, special attention should be paid to whether future policies will become tighter than expected."" 
The world's second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of 2017, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Final Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 54.0 in December, slightly below the preliminary reading of 54.2 but still above a final reading of 53.6 in November.
Even after the slight downward revision, the index was at the highest since February 2014. The index also remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 16th straight month.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector concluded Q4 with the highest PMI reading since February 2014,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Output growth accelerated for a fifth month in succession, while new business opportunities, both domestic and foreign, rose sharply.""
The final index for new orders was 56.2, below the flash reading of 56.6 but above a final 54.7 in the previous month.
The final output price index was 51.0, which is less than the flash reading of 51.4 and below a final 51.3 in November.
One of the government's first tasks in the new year is to secure parliamentary approval of the national budget for fiscal 2018 starting in April.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",China December factory growth quickens to four-month high but confidence subdued: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday. 
The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world's second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists' expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.
The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts have expected some softening in China's manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world's second-largest economy.
That view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace. 
But Caixin's findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.
Total new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.
The Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.
While the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China's exporters in the next few months.
PRICE PRESSURES
However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.
Companies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises. 
China's vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fueled demand and prices for building materials.
But government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade. 
Beijing's war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.
Some steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share. 
Despite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided. 
“Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
""However, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.”
Analysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports. 

Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

“Most participants reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
The Federal Reserve appeared to be optimistic on the future outlook for economic growth, noting that recent data suggested that economic activity had been rising at a ""solid rate"" and that the labor market had continued to strengthen while transitory factors that weighed on inflation in 2017 is expected to subside.
""Real economic activity appeared to be growing at a solid pace, buttressed by gains in consumer and business spending, supportive financial conditions, and an improving global economy,"" the Fed said in the minutes. ""Core PCE prices were forecast to rise faster in 2018, reflecting the expected waning of transitory factors that held down those prices in 2017.""
The central bank also cited the possibility of a steeper path of rate hikes should fiscal stimulus boost output beyond its maximum sustainable level.
""Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions,"" the minutes stated."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.
The economy's robust fundamentals were also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing construction spending rising to a record high in November amid broad gains in both private and public outlays. Given the bullish growth outlook, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in March after increasing borrowing costs three times last year.
""Strong manufacturing and construction data confirm the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders at the turn of the year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The Fed remains solidly on track to lift rates again in March and two more times this year, with possible upside risk if growth doesn't simmer down.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 59.7 last month, the second-highest reading in six years, from 58.2 in November. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
The survey's new orders sub-index shot up 5.4 points to 69.4, the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturers also reported an increase in export orders. While a measure of factory employment fell 2.7 points last months it remained at lofty levels consistent with an expansion in manufacturing payrolls.
Factories also reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey's prices index jumping by 3.5 points. Rising raw material prices bolster the view that inflation will pick up in 2018. 
Manufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from a $1.5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month. The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. 
Business spending surged in anticipation of the corporate tax cuts. Recent weakness in the dollar and a strengthening global economy are expected to buoy exports of U.S.-made goods, which would underpin manufacturing. 
""It is more than just domestic developments that are lifting animal spirits,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""A number of the published industry comments focused on a pick-up in demand from overseas.""
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes hit record highs and prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
BULLISH OUTLOOK
The ISM survey showed manufacturers upbeat about the economic outlook. Machinery producers reported strong international sales and computer and electronic products manufacturers said they were ""seeing a ramp-up with companies releasing early 2018 spend now.""
Food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers, however, struck a more cautious note saying that while the economy and business were strong, signals of ""headwinds in 2018 are persistent.""
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8 percent to an all-time high of $1.257 trillion in November. It advanced 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
The manufacturing and construction reports added to data ranging from the labor market to housing and consumer spending in sketching a robust picture of the U.S. economy. 
Following Wednesday's data, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to an annualized rate of 3.2 percent. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter.
In November, spending on private residential projects soared 1.0 percent to the highest level since February 2007 after rising 0.3 percent in October. The increase was in line with a recent jump in homebuilding and supported expectations that housing would boost economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag on GDP since the April-June period.
Spending on nonresidential structures rebounded 0.9 percent in November after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. Overall, spending on private construction projects climbed 1.0 percent in November to a record high. That followed a 0.3 percent increase in October.
Outlays on public construction projects rose 0.2 percent in November after jumping 3.5 percent in October. Economists, however, expect modest gains in public spending in the months ahead.

""Many state budgets are being squeezed by weaker-than-expected revenues, and face other budgetary pressures related to things like health care,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Also, the impact of the new tax law on state and local budgets is not yet clear.""

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of manufacturing activity increased to 59.7 last month from November’s reading of 58.2.
Analysts had forecast the index to drop to 58.1.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
Furthermore, the ISM indicated that the survey suggested that the overall economy had grown for the 103rd consecutive month.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's retail sales rose for the ninth month in November in their best growth since February 2015 on strong consumer demand and improved tourism, in particular from mainland China.
November retail sales grew 7.5 percent from a year earlier to HK$38.7 billion ($4.95 billion) in value terms, government data showed on Wednesday. Retail sales rose 3.9 percent in October.
In volume terms, sales rose 6.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with 3.6 percent growth in October.
""The near-term outlook for retail sales remains positive, as consumer sentiment is buttressed by the favourable employment and income situation, and as inbound tourism continues to recover,"" the government said in a statement.
Tourist arrivals rose 7.0 percent in November, the highest percentage growth since March, with mainland visitors up 8.6 percent, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Mainland visitors accounted for 74 percent of the total. 
For the first 11 months of 2017, total visitor arrivals rose 3.1 percent. 
Hong Kong's retail sales are continuing to recover after shrinking for the third consecutive year in 2016 and by the most in nearly two decades, hurt by the city's economic downturn and fewer tourists from China.
With its economy closely tied to its giant northern neighbour, Hong Kong has gained from buoyant trading and manufacturing activities linked to China's economic activity.
The still-solid momentum puts the former British colony firmly on track to achieve the government's revised full-year estimate of 3.7 percent growth for 2017 as buoyant stock and property markets help spur consumer spending.
""As the local jobless rate remains low and asset market continues to grow, the wealth effect will continue to lend support to retail consumption,"" said Thomas Shik, acting chief economist of Hang Seng Bank. 
Shik estimates 2 percent growth in Hong Kong's retail sales for the whole of 2017 and 4 percent growth in 2018.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts rose 7.9 percent in value terms in November, marking their fifth consecutive month of growth. That compared with a revised 8.5 percent jump in October. 
Hong Kong's retailers and mall operators have been reporting stronger sales on improved consumption and tourism. 
Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016) said retail sales at its eight major shopping malls in the city on New Year's Eve amounted to HK$76.75 million, up 10 percent from the same period a year ago, with foot traffic growing 12 percent. 
For the first 11 months of 2017, Hong Kong's retail sales increased 1.8 percent in value terms year-on-year and 1.7 percent in volume terms.

856,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>",UK Construction PMI Eases More Than Expected in December,"Investing.com - UK construction sector activity eased slightly in December, missing forecasts and dampening optimism over the British economy, industry data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, market research firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their UK construction purchasing managers' index dropped to a seasonally adjusted 52.2 last month from November’s reading of 53.1.
Economists had expected the index to drop to only 52.8 in December.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that housing continued to be the best performing area of activity and new orders rose at the fastest pace since May.
The research group also indicated that the sharp rate of input price inflation continued in December.
“Construction firms indicated that longer-term business confidence is still relatively subdued, largely reflecting concerns about the domestic economic outlook,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
He explained that only 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipated a reduction.
“As a result, the balance of UK construction companies expecting growth in the year ahead remains among the weakest recorded by the survey since mid-2013,” Moore concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3586 compared to 1.3592 ahead of the release, EUR/GBP was at 0.8859 compared to 0.8857 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 152.60 compared to 152.65 previously.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday in line with European government yields after comments from a European Central Bank official who said the central bank's massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.
Benoit Coeure, the ECB board member who oversees its market operations, told Caixin Global, a Chinese financial magazine that he sees ""a reasonable chance"" the 2.55 trillion euros stimulus program will not be extended again when it expires in September.
""European bonds are weaker because of comments from Coeure,"" said Karl Haeling, vice president at Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg in New York. ""You have a stronger stock market."" 
Investors piled back into stocks from bonds at the start of 2018 after Wall Street scored its strongest performance in four years in 2017, buttressed by steady economic growth, solid corporate earnings and the most dramatic overhaul of the federal tax code in 30 years.
U.S. government bonds <.BCUSATSY> produced a 2.3 percent annual return last year, as low inflation offset three rate increases from the Federal Reserve, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC). This compared with a 19.5 percent yearly gain for the S&P 500 (SPX).
At 10:50 a.m. (1550 GMT), the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) was up 4 basis points at 2.452 percent following a 2 basis-point dip last year.
Its German counterpart rose nearly 3 basis point to 0.454 percent after touching a two-month peak earlier Tuesday.
In the bond market selloff, the margin between shorter and longer-dated Treasury yields grew after last week's flattening. The five-to-30-year part of the yield curve  steepened to almost 55 basis points from 51 basis points earlier on Tuesday which was its flattest level in a decade.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), rose to to 55.1 in December, from the prior reading of 55.0. It was the highest reading since March 2015. 
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Economists had estimated that it would remain flat at 55.0.
Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said businesses were expecting to be busier in the early months of 2018, while optimism about the coming year was at its highest in two years. 
“The upbeat mood is underscored by an increased appetite to hire new staff, with the survey indicating that factory payroll numbers are rising at a rate not seen for over three years,"" he said. “Indicators of backlogs of work and input buying likewise suggest production will continue to grow at a solid pace as we move into 2018. However, the strengthening of demand for raw materials has led to supply chain delays, which have in turn been increasingly linked to higher prices as a sellers’ market develops.""
After the report, the US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 91.65 compared to 91.64 before the report.

The Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.7 in December from 54.4 the previous month. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector. 
The measure of output rose to 54.1 from 53.7, while new orders increased to 54.6 from 53.9. Companies said the increased demand was partly due to spending in the energy sector, which is recovering from the oil price crash more than two years ago.
New orders for exports also saw modest growth, rising to 50.6 from 49.4, with manufacturers pointing to improving global economic conditions.
Meanwhile, backlogs of work continued to grow, with the index at a nearly three-and-a-half-year high of 52.4 from November's 51.8. 
Manufacturers were somewhat upbeat about the year ahead with 36 percent of those surveyed expecting output volumes to rise in 2018, compared to 7 percent who anticipate a decline.

861,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 04:36AM ET</span>","UK Manufacturing Growth Slows, Remains Solid in December","Investing.com - Activity in the UK manufacturing sector slowed slightly in the last month of the year, but continued to expand at a solid pace, according to survey data released on Tuesday.
Research group IHS Markit said that its UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 56.3 in December from 58.2 in November, which was a 51-month high.
Economists had forecast a reading of 58.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Although December saw rates of expansion in output, new orders and employment slow from November’s highs, growth in all three remained solid and well above long-run trends, the report said.
“UK manufacturing ended 2017 on a positive footing. Although growth of output and new orders moderated during December, rates of expansion remained comfortably above long-term trend rates,” said Rob Dobson, director at survey compiler Markit.
“The sector has therefore broadly maintained its solid boost to broader economic expansion in the fourth quarter.”"
862,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",German factory growth hits record high in December: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German factories shifted into overdrive in December as strong foreign demand propelled growth in activity to a record high and capacity constraints led to the biggest delivery delays in more than 20 years, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a quarter of the economy, jumped to an all-time high of 63.3 from 62.5 in the previous month.
The final figure, unchanged from the initial flash reading, was far above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction, as Europe's largest economy ended 2017 on an unusually strong footing.
""Twenty-seventeen was a record-breaking year for the German manufacturing sector,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
Smith said the PMI not only posted the highest reading ever recorded since the survey began in 1996, but its current 37-month sequence of improving business conditions also beat the previous record set in the runup to the financial crisis.
""The goods-producing economy carries strong momentum into 2018, with new order growth at its highest for almost eight years and rising backlogs of work pointing to the need for further expansion in capacity,"" Smith added.
The PMI showed steep increases in output, new orders and exports. The level of new contracts received from abroad - mainly from Asia, the United States and Europe - rose at the fastest rate in the history of the survey.
Higher prices for raw materials such as steel and other metals pushed up input costs in December, and this in turn led to another push up in prices charged by manufacturers, the data showed.

""A lingering concern is that supply-side constraints pose a risk to the sector's ability to kick on,"" Smith said, adding that huge delivery delays would inevitably be borne out by sustained upward pressure on input costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.
The bloc's economy outpaced its peers last year, and the European Central Bank plans to scale back its stimulus program from this month.
IHS Markit's December final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading and above November's 60.1. That was the highest since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 62.2 from November's 61.0 - its highest in over 17 years and has only been above that once in the survey's history.
""The euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Forward-looking indicators bode well for the new year: new orders rose at a near-record pace, while purchasing growth hit a new peak as firms readied themselves for higher production.
Meanwhile, job creation was maintained at November's record pace.""
Despite factories raising prices again last month, albeit at a slightly weaker rate than in November, an index measuring new orders nudged up to 61.5 from 61.4, a level not seen since around the start of the century.
Inflation was 1.5 percent in November, below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling, but the central bank announced in October it will halve its monthly asset purchases to 30 billion euros from January.

A majority of economists in a Reuters poll last year said they thought the ECB should shut the door on the program in September, but they were split on whether it actually would.

Tuesday's data firms up views that business in Asia's third-largest economy continues to recover but also highlights risks that rising price pressures will keep the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from slashing interest rates further.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 54.7 in December from November's 52.6, marking its fifth straight month above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction.
""India's goods-producing economy advanced on its recovery path, with operating conditions improving at the strongest pace since December 2012,"" said Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit.
""Strong business performance was underpinned by the fastest expansions in output and new orders since December 2012 and October 2016, respectively. Anecdotal evidence pointed to stronger market demand from home and international markets.""
The country's manufacturing sector witnessed higher payroll figures in December while the rate of job creation rose to its highest since August 2012.
The latest survey showed the new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, also rose to 56.8 in December, the highest since October 2016. 
Foreign demand also expanded at its quickest pace since June.
""Challenges remain as the economy adjusts to recent shocks, but the overall upturn was robust compared to the trend observed for the survey history. This outlook was shared by the manufacturing community as sentiment picked-up to the strongest in three months amid expected improvements in market conditions over the next 12 months,"" Dodhia added.
At the same time, stronger demand allowed firms to raise prices at the fastest pace in 10 months to make up for rising input costs, suggesting overall inflation could remain above the central bank's medium-term target of 4.0 percent in the coming month.
India's retail inflation in November breached the central bank's medium-term target of 4 percent, which could put pressure on it to raise policy rates in the coming months.

Minutes from the RBI's December meeting show bank members are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's factories ended a strong 2017 on a mixed note, with activity at multi-year highs in Taiwan and India and surprisingly picking up in China, but contracting in some places in a sign regional interest rate hikes likely will be gradual.
A trend of synchronised global growth that became apparent over the course of last year looked set to continue, with activity surveys in the euro zone and the United States later in the day expected to post strong readings.
""Robust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,"" said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.
In China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced economists' expectations for a dip to 50.6. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Tuesday's survey, which pushed Asian shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market.
Analysts say the difference stems from the fact that the Caixin/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports.
A CHINA SLOWDOWN?
China is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world's second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October's key Communist Party congress.
Beijing is expected to target 2018 growth at around 6.5 percent.
""We believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cooldown of the property market,"" BofA Merrill Lynch economists said.
China's slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is seen hiking 2-3 times in 2018.
There will likely be ""only a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,"" HSBC analysts said in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade.
In November, the Bank of Korea raised interest rates for the first time in more than six years, becoming the first major Asian central bank to hike since 2014. Malaysia and the Philippines could hike early this year, then Australia and New Zealand later on.
RIDING A TECH BOOM
On Sunday, South Korea's central bank chief said monetary policy should remain accommodative as inflationary pressures remained weak. Factory activity, which has been riding a global tech boom, contracted in December, dropping from a 4-1/2 year high in November, the Nikkei/Markit survey showed.
Another major tech producer, Taiwan, saw manufacturing activity hitting its highest since April 2011 at 56.6 last month, according to a December survey.
Singapore on Tuesday posted slower economic growth in the fourth quarter than the third as manufacturing shrank 11.5 percent following an eye-popping 38 percent jump in the previous three months. 
However, full-year growth was still the fastest in three years at 3.5 percent, raising the possibility that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) could tighten its exchange rate-based monetary policy this year.
""Given robust GDP growth and inflation upside risk, we think MAS will shift and tighten to a 'mild appreciation bias' at the April meeting,"" Maybank Kim Eng economist Chua Hak Bin said.
PMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday. 
The Nikkei/Markit survey for India's December factory activity showed it expanded at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firms up views that interest rates in Asia's third-largest economy have probably bottomed.

December factory activity accelerated in Vietnam, but shrank marginally in Malaysia and Indonesia.

The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world's second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists' expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.
The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts have expected some softening in China's manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world's second-largest economy.
That view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.
But Caixin's findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.
Total new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.
The Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.
While the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China's exporters in the next few months.
PRICE PRESSURES
However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.
Companies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.
China's vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fueled demand and prices for building materials.
But government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.
Beijing's war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.
Some steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.
Despite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.
“Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
""However, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.”
Analysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.

Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

Property consultant CoreLogic said its index of home prices for the combined capital cities dipped 0.4 percent in December from November.
Annual growth in prices slowed to 4.3 percent, from 5.2 percent in November and 10.5 percent in the middle of 2017.
Prices in Sydney slipped 0.9 percent in December and pulled annual growth down to just 3.1 percent, a far cry from the peak of 17 percent seen early in the year. Sydney dwelling values are still up 71 percent on the cyclical low hit in February 2012.
Melbourne fared somewhat better, thanks in part to rapid population growth, with prices easing 0.2 percent in December to be 8.9 percent higher for the year.
Home prices outside the major cities edged up 0.2 percent in December to be 3.8 percent higher on the year.
A slowdown has been much desired by the country's bank watchdog which tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans, leading banks to raise rates on some mortgage products.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has also been concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks.
The inexorable rise of prices in the major cities had put homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers and had become a political hot potato.
Yet the boom has also been a boon for household wealth with the government statistician estimating the housing stock was worth a cool A$6.8 trillion ($5.3 trillion) at the end of the third quarter - four times the size of annual gross domestic product.

The explosion in wealth had helped offset weakness in wages, so any lasting downturn in home prices could now act as a drag on consumer confidence and spending.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed slightly in December as a punishing crackdown on air pollution and a cooling property market start to weigh on the world's second-largest economy. 
The data support the view that the economy is beginning to gradually lose steam after growing by a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, but the findings did not appear to suggest a risk of sharper slowdown at this point. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Sunday dipped to 51.6 in December, down from 51.8 in November and in line with forecasts from economists in a Reuters poll.
But the overall reading still appeared relatively solid, and marked the 18th straight month that the sector has expanded. The 50-point level divides growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The figures showed that China's full-year 2017 economic growth would be at about 6.9 percent and around 6.5 percent for 2018, according to the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, which compiles the data. Both predictions would be slightly stronger than those in a Reuters poll.
""Overall, 2017's economic performance continues to be steady and good, establishing a generally good foundation for 2018,"" the federation said.
""Recent PMI surveys show companies are confident for economic development in the new year, with production and operating activity expectation indices showing significant improvement.""
ON A ROLL
Boosted by hefty government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturing and industrial firms have been a major driver behind solid economic growth this year, with their strong appetite for raw materials boosting global commodity prices.
However, a slowdown has started to take hold in the last few months due to a wide-ranging combination of government measures, from a crackdown on smog in heavily industrialized northern provinces to continued curbs on the housing market which are weighing on property investment.
Chinese steelmakers in 28 cities have been ordered to curb output between mid-November and mid-March, while a campaign to promote cleaner energy by converting coal to natural gas has also hampered manufacturing activity in some cities, leading to shortages and sending prices spiking.
Still, there are signs that steel mills, smelters and plants in parts of the country with fewer restrictions have ramped up production to win more market share, largely offsetting the ""rustbelt"" declines on a nation-wide basis.
A PMI sub-reading for production fell to 54 from 54.3 in November, but was bang in line with the average over the last six months.
Total new orders also dipped in December, to 53.4 from 53.6, but export orders grew at the fastest pace in six months, pointing to sustained strength in global demand heading into the new year and helping boost business optimism to the highest since September.
Chinese manufacturers continued to face stiff pressure from rising costs, however. A sub-index for input prices rose to 62.2 from 59.8 in November, while output price gains also picked up, which could pressure profit margins on companies further down the supply chain.
TAPPING THE BRAKES
Slowly rising borrowing costs due to a government crackdown on riskier lending practices are also expected to drag more prominently on economic activity in 2018.
The central bank nudged up interbank rates earlier this month for the fourth time this year, though policymakers are keen not to tap the brakes too sharply and risk a sharper economic slowdown.
Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as in 2017, even as they continue efforts to defuse the risks from a rapid build-up of debt.
In a further sign of resilience, growth in China's services sector, which was already robust, kicked up another notch in December, a sister survey showed. 
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a three-month high of 55 from 54.8 in November.
And a reading on the construction sector rose to 63.9 from 61.4 in November, which was surprising given slowing property investment and the seasonal decline in building activity usually seen in colder months.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.

China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.

On Thursday, MNI Indicators and ISM-Chicago said their jointly developed Chicago Purchase Management Index rose to 67.6 in December, the highest since March 2011.
The Marquette University and Milwaukee ISM survey's component on new orders, a proxy on future activity, increased to 88.33 from 66.46 last month, while its production gauge improved to 72.65 from 57.94.

Not all the components improved in December. The survey's employment index fell to 58.67 from 61.73, while its six-month outlook gauge slipped to 71.43 from 73.33.

The long-stagnant Italian economy has been picking up since the end of last year and the recovery is looking increasingly solid, supported by job growth and buoyant business sentiment.
Third-quarter GDP growth clocked in at 0.4 percent, ISTAT said earlier this month, adding that even if there is no growth in the fourth quarter, full-year growth will come in at 1.4 percent.

The government forecasts expansion of 1.5 percent for 2017, which would be the strongest rate since 2010, but lag other European Union countries.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 12:23AM ET</span>",China December factory growth seen slowing only slightly despite smog war,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's sprawling manufacturing sector likely slowed only slightly in December despite tough pollution measures that have forced some factories to curb production and a cooling housing market, a Reuters poll showed. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on Sunday is expected to dip marginally to 51.6 for December from an unexpectedly solid 51.8 in November, according to a median forecast of 30 economists polled by Reuters.
While the reading is seen softening, it would still suggest the 18th straight month of expansion for China's manufacturers, which are posting their strongest profits in years thanks to a building boom and resurgent export demand. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
However, a slowdown has started to take hold in the sector in the last few months due to a wide-ranging combination of government measures, from the crackdown on smog in heavily industrialized northern provinces to continued curbs on the housing market which are weighing on property investment.
Chinese steelmakers in 28 cities have been ordered to curb output between mid-November and mid-March, while a campaign to promote cleaner energy by converting coal to natural gas has also hampered manufacturing activity in some cities, leading to shortages and sending prices spiking.
Still, there are signs that steel mills, smelters and plants in parts of the country with fewer restrictions have ramped up production to win more market share, largely offsetting the ""rustbelt"" declines on a nation-wide basis. 
While the war on smog is creating a lot of noise around China's true industrial activity, underlying demand is clearly starting to show some signs of fatigue as massive government infrastructure spending begins to taper off and cities look set to keep tough housing curbs in place to keep a lid on soaring prices.
Higher borrowing costs are also expected to drag more forcefully on factory activity in 2018 as Beijing continues to focus on reducing high corporate debt levels and defusing risks in the financial system.
The central bank nudged up interbank rates earlier this month for the fourth time this year, though policymakers are keen not to tap the brakes too sharply and risk a sharper economic slowdown.
Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.
A similar growth target was set for 2017, but Beijing is expected to easily meet or beat that given strong 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year. 
Economists expect the findings of a private survey on China's factory activity on Tuesday will also show activity in December expanded at slightly slower but still solid pace. 
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will be 50.6 in December versus 50.8 the previous month.
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from the year-long state-led construction boom as large, government-owned ""smokestack"" industries.
The official PMI survey will be published on Dec. 31, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector.
The private Caixin PMI will be published on Jan. 2, with the Caixin services PMI to be released on Jan. 4.

With new Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon at the helm for the first time since the departure of Agustin Carstens last month, the Banco de Mexico board raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent, the highest in nearly nine years.
The minutes of the Dec. 14 meeting reinforced the bank's more hawkish tone under its new boss, with all members of the four-person board agreeing their main task will be to contain inflation in the medium and long term.
""Some (board members) argued that given the current environment, the current monetary policy stance is not congruent with a trajectory for inflation converging to the 3.0 percent goal toward the end of next year,"" the minutes said.
There have already been signs some board members believe the bank may have to go further to beat back inflation, which reached 6.69 percent in early December. One argued for a 50 basis-point rate hike in the monetary policy meeting.
""They signaled the inflation outlook has deteriorated and it is likely they will need to raise interest rates again, perhaps as soon as the next meeting, which is scheduled for Feb. 8,"" said Gabriela Siller, an economist at Banco BASE. 
A majority of board members believe reaching the 3 percent inflation target will take longer than anticipated, the minutes showed. The majority said inflation will be close to target rate by the end of next year and hover around 3 percent in 2019.
A majority of board members thought the balance of risks to growth was still tilted downwards, while all of them thought the balance of risks for inflation had deteriorated.

A majority of board members also noted the peso currency could depreciate if talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are unfavorable. U.S. monetary and fiscal policy changes, as well as concerns over Mexico's 2018 presidential election, could also weigh, while a favorable NAFTA renegotiation could lift the peso, a majority said. The peso  this month slipped to an almost 10-month low against the dollar on worries about inflation and other concerns, including the potential threat to investment in Mexico from U.S. corporate tax cuts.

U.S. workers filed 245,000 initial claims for state unemployment benefits during the week that ended Dec. 23, according to seasonally adjusted figures published by the Labor Department on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevized.
Since mid-October, claims have been confined to a range of 223,000 to 252,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging down to 240,000 in the latest week. Last week marked the 147th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The labor market is widely seen as near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Labor market tightness and a strengthening economy encouraged the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates earlier this month for a third time this year. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes for 2018.
The economy added 228,000 jobs in November, well above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The Labor Department said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria battered the islands. The processing of claims in Puerto Rico was still not back to normal. 
Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, which is seen as a measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,750 to 237,750.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 7,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended Dec. 16. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,250 to 1.92 million.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall to 240,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 237,750, up 1,750 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 05:31AM ET</span>","Japan's factories, retailers rev up as some central bankers call for debate on rates","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's best run of growth in a decade looks set to stretch into 2018, with data on Thursday showing most factories and consumers stepping up a gear, giving policymakers more reasons to discuss an end to crisis-era stimulus.
Industrial production marked its first back-to-back months of increases this year, with a 0.6 rise in November following a 0.5 percent gain in October, the government said. Factories are churning out memory chips for smart phones and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to fill orders from Asia and North America.
Japan's long-cautious consumers are also spending more on electronics, cars and fuel, numbers showed. Retail sales in November increased 2.2 percent from a year earlier, better than the 1.2 percent predicted by economists.
""Consumer spending is doing well, supported by rising stock markets,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. ""The Bank of Japan's policy focus is on interest rates, so it is only natural to question its purchases of risk assets.""
Manufacturers project output will jump 3.4 percent in December but then drop 4.5 percent in January, suggesting some moderation.
The numbers add to a string of data showing Japan's economy is in its best shape in more than a decade. The jobless rate is at a 24-year low, exports have risen every month this year, business investment is up for four straight quarters and GDP has expanded every quarter for nearly two years.
Japan's stock market, meanwhile, has rallied more than 20 percent this year to reach 26-year highs, which has also boosted consumer sentiment.
The surprisingly strong growth in recent months prompted some BOJ board members to raise the prospect of reducing the central bank's massive stimulus, a summary of opinions from last week's meeting showed on Thursday.
Such policies were aimed at jolting Japan out of deflation but some BOJ board members are encouraging debate about raising rates or lowering purchases of exchange-traded funds.
If the outlook for prices and the economy improves, the BOJ will need to consider whether ""adjustments in the level of interest rates will be necessary,"" one board member said.
Another board member said the BOJ should examine the policy effects and the possible side effects of ETF purchases from ""every angle"" because of rising stock prices and earnings.
The BOJ buys long-term government debt to keep 10-year yields around zero and also buys ETFs, which are traded on the stock market, increasing its holdings by around 6 trillion yen ($53 billion) a year.
The summary of opinions does not identify individual speakers, and it is unclear whether a majority of the BOJ's nine-person board shares these views. 
But it is clear that the economy's strength has spurred debate about when and how to end the central bank's aggressive monetary easing, which includes buying massive amounts of government bonds, stocks and other assets to keep interest rates low and flood the market with money to spur inflation.
POLICY CHALLENGES
Inflation, however, remains stubbornly low, with the core consumer price index up 0.9 percent in November, data this week showed, far from the BOJ's target of 2 percent.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last week that as long as consumer prices remain distant from the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target he does not want to raise rates.
When the BOJ first launched its ETF purchases in 2013, it argued such buying of unconventional assets would lower risk premiums and help the economy overcome deflation.
But some traders argue that the BOJ's ETF purchases artificially push up the prices of underlying shares, and that strong stock market gains this year mean these purchases are no longer warranted.
""The economy is doing well, but that doesn't make the BOJ's job any easier,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities. ""I personally think the BOJ should stop buying ETFs, but if they did now, stocks would fall, the yen would rise, and that would actually worsen the economic outlook.""

878,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 02:00PM ET</span>",Factbox - Wall Street in 2018: the biggest risks for stocks,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's rally could have another leg up next year thanks to a sweeping tax cut and economic momentum, but investors are counting the risks that could abruptly end the party.
The S&P 500 (SPX) is up about 20 percent with less than a week to go of 2017, and many strategists expect the bull run that began in 2009 to extend into next year, albeit with smaller gains. Optimism is high following sweeping tax cuts passed by Congress last week that are expected to give an added boost to corporate profits next year. 
But strategists and investors highlight these risks for the year ahead:
FED GETS TOO AGGRESSIVE
The pace of interest rate hikes, particularly after stronger economic data, could derail the market, say some. The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than two years in the third quarter.
Wall Street's top banks expect the Fed to raise U.S. interest rates three times in 2018, matching the number of rate hikes this year and the central bank's own outlook.
""That will be a risk for the market,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""You're going to risk inverting the yield curve at that point and provide a reasonable competition to equities."" 
INFLATION ACCELERATES
Some strategists fear inflation will accelerate too quickly as economic growth picks up, creating margin pressure and putting pressure on the Fed to bump up rates faster than investors expect.
""Inflation could be a global game-changer for stock and credit markets,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts said in their 2018 outlook this month, adding that wage inflation was potentially the most important factor for the stock market.
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
Investors will pay close attention to next year's midterm elections. Democrats are hoping to reclaim seats in Congress, now controlled by Republicans. 
""If the Republicans lose the House or Senate, or both, then that would probably be a big negative for the market,"" said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at  Prudential  (LON:PRU) International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. ""The market would begin to worry that... the Trump agenda will be stopped in its tracks."" 
GEOPOLITICAL PROBLEMS GET WORSE
Rising tensions between the United States and North Korea rattled markets around the world in 2017, but Wall Street was able to shake off those worries. Next year, these and other geopolitical concerns are likely to come up again, strategists said.
""Tensions abound, remaining elevated with North Korea and rising in the Middle East,"" Keith Lerner, chief market strategist and managing director, portfolio and market strategist, SunTrust Advisory Services, Inc, in Atlanta, Georgia, wrote in his 2018 outlook note.
Also, ""the political pendulum is swinging toward populism and nationalism across the globe.""
Next year is expected to include key elections in Italy, Mexico and Brazil, among others.
VALUATIONS KEEP RISING, ALONG WITH SENTIMENT
While strategists expect U.S. earnings to get an added jolt of adrenaline next year because of the tax cuts, some worry it might not be enough to justify stretched valuations.
The S&P 500 is trading at about 18.5 times forward earnings, the highest since 2002, Thomson Reuters data shows.
Investor sentiment could raise some concerns, according to a Dec. 15 note from Citigroup's Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Tobias Levkovich.
Citi's panic/euphoria model is signaling a greater than 60 percent probability of a down market by this time next year, ""which is akin to waving a yellow flag of caution,"" he wrote. 
CRYPTOCURRENCY RUN REVERSES FAST
The world's biggest and best known digital currency, bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), has been on a tear, and could be a wild card for 2018. 

""Bitcoin is on a momentum run, and momentum plays go until they don't anymore,"" said Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, adding that investors would ask: ""'If Bitcoin can go down a multiple tens of percent, why can't my stocks as well?'""

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index rose to a reading of 109.5, up 0.2 percent from October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales falling 0.4 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
The housing sector has regained some momentum recently after treading water for much of the year because of a lack of inventory which has driven up prices, and both labor and land shortages.
The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than two years in the third quarter, powered by robust business spending, while the jobless rate in November held at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.

Pending sales rose 0.8 percent in November from the same month of 2016, the first 12-month gain since June. Contracts rose 2.5 percent in the South from a year earlier. Sales also increased in the Northeast and Midwest while they fell 2.3 percent in the West.

The reading on the index itself increased to 109.5 from the prior 109.3. That was its highest reading since June.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at an annualized rate of 0.8% in November.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun indicated that contract signings mustered a small gain in November and were up annually for the first time since June.
Yun suggested that the housing market had strengthened thanks to solid job creation and a strong economy.
“However, new buyers coming into the market are finding out quickly that their options are limited and competition is robust,” he noted.
“Realtors say many would-be buyers from earlier this year, stifled by tight supply and higher prices, are still trying to buy a home,” he explained.
One of the biggest questions heading into 2018, according to Yun, is if the depressed levels of available supply can improve enough to slow price growth and make buying a home more affordable

“Consumer confidence retreated in December after reaching a 17-year high in November,” Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
“The decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,” she added.
However, Franco noted that consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved moderately and that, despite the decline in confidence, consumers’ expectations ""remained at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”

The main factor holding firms back in Europe's biggest economy is a shortage of skilled labor, the IW economic institute in Cologne said.
Its poll showed that 26 of 48 industry associations were more upbeat than they were at the end of 2016 and more than two- thirds expected firms in their sector to produce more next year than this.
""Despite the protectionist policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and prospect of Brexit, investment in Germany rose this year and will strengthen further in 2018,"" said IW in a statement. 
Only two sectors were pessimistic - the food industry, which is worried about tougher competition and higher costs, and sections of the cooperative banking sector which are suffering from low interest rates and margins.
The IW said 24 of the 47 industry associations which gave investment estimates, expect higher spending levels from their member companies.
The main factor holding back firms is a shortage of skilled labor, a long-standing concern in Germany. 
""The production prospects in the German economy could be better if more skilled workers were available,"" said IW Director Michael Huether. 
Most economists expect the German economy to grow for the ninth consecutive year in 2018. Earlier this month, the Ifo institute forecast 2.6 percent growth for next year, following an expected expansion of 2.3 percent for this year.

A separate survey of 820 mostly family-owned businesses, showed that 69 percent expected improvements in their operating business next year, up from 59 percent a year ago.

Key Takeaways
A lingering shortage of previously owned homes is keeping housing prices elevated. That’s allowed homeowners to recover the equity lost during the housing collapse and recession a decade ago. Sales, meanwhile, are strengthening as the labor market remains robust and borrowing costs stay close to historically low levels.
For those looking to buy for the first time, conditions are less favorable. Growth in property values is outpacing wage gains and limiting affordability, representing a headwind for the market.
Economist Views
“Home prices continue their climb supported by low inventories and increasing sales,” David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P index committee, said in a statement. But that climb may be interrupted by the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates next year, he said. “Since home prices are rising faster than wages, salaries, and inflation, some areas could see potential homebuyers compelled to look at renting.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea exports likely rose for a 14th straight month in December, wrapping up the year with an upbeat tone as global demand for memory chips and petroleum goods from Asia's third biggest exporter continued. 
In a Reuters poll, 10 economists saw exports expanding 10.3 percent from a year earlier, picking up some pace after November's 9.5 percent gain.
""Overseas sales will continue to speed up this month on strong global demand on memory chips, petroleum goods and ships,"" said Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment.
He said exports ""are likely to maintain current robust growth in 2018, though some downside risks remain"" such as possible revision of Seoul's free trade pact with the United States and appreciation of South Korean won.
South Korea's exports from Dec. 1 to Dec. 20 soared 16.4 percent from a year earlier, while imports jumped 19.5 percent over the same period, preliminary data from the government showed. 
The poll's median forecast for imports was a rise of 12.1 percent in December, a shade less than the annual increase of 12.7 percent rise a month earlier.
Tuesday's poll also showed economists expect South Korea's industrial production rose 1.2 percent in November from a month earlier, rebounding sharply from October's decline of 1.1 percent.
""October's weak industrial production was mainly due to fewer number of working days as the nation celebrated Chuseok holiday, which means November's reading will definitely show a rebound,"" said Kwon Ah-min, an economist at Dongbu Securities.
In the poll, the annual inflation rate for December was seen at 1.5 percent, slightly up from 1.3 percent the previous month.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2017 11:13PM ET</span>",Japan's household spending jumps but BOJ seen keeping stimulus,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's households spent more than expected in November while consumer inflation ticked up and the jobless rate hit a fresh 24-year low, offering the central bank some hope an economic recovery will drive up inflation to its 2 percent target.
But the increase in prices was due mostly to a boost from rising fuel costs that is seen fading in 2018, keeping the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain its huge monetary support even as other central banks seek an end to crisis-mode policies.
Minutes of the BOJ's October rate review showed that while most central bank policymakers saw no need to ramp up stimulus, they agreed on the need to sustain ""powerful"" monetary easing for the time being.
""There's a chance inflation may gradually accelerate toward the fiscal year beginning in April,"" as a tightening job market pressures companies to raise wages, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But inflation remains distant from the BOJ's 2 percent target, so the central bank will probably maintain its current policy framework.""
Spending was driven by broadbased gains, with households loosening the purse strings for items such as refrigerators, washing machines, and sporting goods and services such as eating-out and travel.
Data also showed wage earners' disposable income rose 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier, suggesting that higher incomes have encouraged consumers to open their wallets.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil goods but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.9 percent in November from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, marking the 11th straight month of gains.
The pace of price growth was just ahead of October's 0.8 percent and a median market forecast of the same rate.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were up 0.8 percent in December from a year earlier, faster than market forecasts for 0.7 percent growth.
JOB MARKET TIGHTENS FURTHER
Separate data released on Tuesday showed prospects for a sustained recovery were picking up. The unemployment rate hit a fresh 24-year low of 2.7 percent in November and job availability rose to a nearly 44-year high.
Household spending rose 1.7 percent in November from a year earlier, far exceeding forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase.
The slew of upbeat data may offer relief to BOJ policymakers, who are increasingly worried about the demerits of ultra-easy policy but wary of choking off a budding economic recovery by dialing back stimulus too quickly.
At the October rate review, several BOJ policymakers voiced concern of taking ""extreme steps"" just to hit their price goal, countering calls by board newcomer Goushi Kataoka that additional easing measures were necessary.
Most members felt that maintaining current policy was sufficient, though conceding it may take some time before firms more actively raise prices and wages, the minutes showed.
Japan's economy grew an annualized 2.5 percent in July-September to mark a seventh straight quarter of growth thanks to robust exports and capital expenditure.
But the inflation rate remains distant from the BOJ's target, as firms remain wary of scaring away cost-sensitive consumers with price hikes.

The BOJ kept monetary policy steady in October and a subsequent meeting in December, reassuring markets it will lag well behind overseas peers in ending its ultra-loose monetary settings.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","India to leapfrog UK and France in 2018, Britain's Cebr predicts","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - India looks set to leapfrog Britain and France next year to become the world's fifth-largest economy in dollar terms, a report showed on Tuesday.
The Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) consultancy's 2018 World Economic League Table painted an upbeat view of the global economy, boosted by cheap energy and technology prices.
India's ascent is part of a trend that will see Asian economies increasingly dominate the top 10 largest economies over the next 15 years.
""Despite temporary setbacks ... India's economy has still caught up with that of France and the UK and in 2018 will have overtaken them both to become the world's fifth largest economy in dollar terms,"" said Douglas McWilliams, Cebr deputy chairman.
McWilliams said India's growth had been slowed by restrictions on high-value banknotes and a new sales tax, a view shared by economists polled by Reuters.
China is likely to overtake the United States as the world's No.1 economy in 2032, Cebr said.
""Because the impact of President Trump on trade has been less severe than expected, the USA will retain its global crown a year longer than we anticipated in the last report,"" the report said.
While Britain looks set to lag behind France over the next couple of years, Cebr predicted that Brexit's effects on Britain's economy will be less than feared, allowing it to overtake France again in 2020.
Russia was vulnerable to low oil prices and too reliant on the energy sector, and looked likely to fall to 17th place among the world's largest economies by 2032, from 11th now.

A Reuters poll of economists in late October suggested global economic growth in 2018 looks likely to quicken slightly to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent this year - with risks to that forecast lying on the upside.

The budget, totaling 221.7 billion denars ($4.28 billion) and adopted late on Friday, allocated spending equivalent to about 400 million euros ($474.28 million) for capital investment, while average annual inflation was expected to be 1.7 percent. Revenues were forecast at 193.5 billion denars.
The main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party boycotted the budget vote in protest at the arrest of a former interior minister, several lawmakers and political activists on charges related to violence in parliament in April, which pushed the nation into a political crisis.
Macedonia's central bank revised its economic growth forecast for 2017 down to 0.5 percent from 2.5 percent, citing a poor economic performance in the first half of the year because of political instability.
Macedonia's two-year crisis over a wiretapping scandal that toppled the government of nationalist Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, ended in June with the appointment of a pro-Western government of the Social Democrat Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Finance Minister Dragan Tevdovski told parliament that the government planned to finance the deficit through a combination of domestic and foreign loans. 
""The borrowing abroad may be done through a Eurobond or favorable foreign loans,"" Tevdovski said.
The economy of the landlocked Balkan country grew by 2.4 percent in 2016 but national output contracted 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2017, the first decline since 2012. 
Macedonia, which won independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991, has made little progress towards membership of the European Union and the NATO alliance due to a name dispute with Greece.

The total is up 15.9 percent from October's $334.89 million but far lower than $613.2 million a year ago, according to data released by China's General Administration of Customs.
While the data shows a monthly pickup, China's trade with North Korea has been slowing since the latest United Nations penalties came into force on Sept. 5, banning Pyongyang from selling coal, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood abroad.
The world's second-largest economy bought goods worth $100.18 million from North Korea in the last month, up from $90.75 million in October but lower compared to $262.2 million a year ago, data shows.
October was the lowest on Chinese government records going back to January 2014.
Exports totaled $287.84 million in November up from $244.2 million in October. 
Trade between the two countries has slowed this year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February. But the pace of the drop has quickened as the most recent curbs hurt Pyongyang's ability to sell some critical commodities to one of its chief trading partners.
The U.N. estimated the latest ban, imposed after its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, would slash North Korea's $3-billion annual export revenue by a third.
On Friday, the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea for its Nov. 29 intercontinental ballistic missile test aimed at limiting its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil as well as its earnings from workers abroad.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's budget deficit was just 0.1 percent of gross domestic product in the 12 months ending in September, putting the country on course to beat its full-year target and reduce its debt burden.
The third quarter year-on-year figure compared with 1.3 percent three months earlier and indicated a July-September surplus of 2.6 percent.
The National Statistics Institute said on Friday that in the first nine months of the year the deficit fell to 0.3 percent of GDP from 2.8 percent in the same period of 2016.
Portugal exited an international bailout program in 2014 with many European officials holding the country up as a success story in reforming its economy.
The official full-year deficit target is 1.4 percent - which would make it a new record low in over four decades of the country's democratic history, but Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Thursday the budget gap should narrow even more from last year's 2 percent and end the year below 1.3 percent.
The European Union demands deficits at or below 3 percent.
Finance Minister Mario Centeno told reporters the deficit reduction ""shows that the sustainability of public accounts is now a reality"" in Portugal and will allow for the biggest cut in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 19 years - to around 126 percent in 2017 from last year's around 130 percent.
This is still a huge debt; the EU wants it at or heading down towards 60 percent.
The latest deficit estimate does not include any impact from the recapitalization of state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos by the state, worth around 4 billion euros, or 2.1 percent of GDP.
The government has said it expects Brussels to disregard the recapitalization in this year's deficit and INE is involved in a dialogue with Eurostat regarding the impact of this complex operation on national accounts.
The INE said that in the 12 months to September, revenues rose 2.7 percent while spending edged 0.1 percent lower from June levels.
""In the setting of higher growth than initially projected we see revenues following the same trend as the economy,"" Centeno said.

The Socialist government expects economic growth to accelerate to 2.6 percent this year after 1.5 percent in 2016. Its initial forecast in the 2017 budget had put this year's expansion at just 1.5 percent.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>",Singapore authorities' housing market warning may fall on deaf ears,"By Masayuki Kitano and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's authorities are concerned the island-state's property market could be setting itself up for a fall. 
A series of aggressive land deals by developers, against the backdrop of rising apartment sales and the first quarterly rise in private home prices for four years, was enough to prompt a recent warning from the nation's central bank to lenders, homebuyers and real estate firms. 
There should be vigilance about risks ""including the impact of rising interest rates, geopolitical developments, and excessive exuberance in the property market,"" Ong Chong Tee, a deputy managing director of the central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said at the end of November. 
Persuading people to be more cautious could be a tough sell. 
Local and foreign investors have waited years for signs that prices are bottoming out, and developers want to make sure they have a pipeline of projects in the land-starved state.
Real estate investors' animal spirits have certainly been reviving. 
Singapore is looking relatively cheap compared with some other major property markets in the region – where prices have been surging almost without a pause in recent years. For example, housing prices, as of the third quarter, had risen 38 percent in Hong Kong and 54 percent in Sydney from four years earlier. 
KNOCK DOWN
The property companies have been paying record sums to buy government land and existing apartment blocks, which they plan to knock down and re-build with developments that have more units.
A November report by consultancy Cushman & Wakefield estimated developers paid a 22-percent average premium for the top five residential sites in 2017 over comparable sites in the past. 
Authorities say recent sales could add 20,000 new private housing units, which will more than double the number of unsold units in the pipeline within the next 1-2 years.
But developers are hungry for land because their unsold inventory is close to record lows, nearly half the level in 2013, official data shows. And any physical oversupply is still some time away as apartments take four to five years to build. 
The authorities' fear is that buying fervor will run ahead of an anticipated increase in housing supply, which could create an imbalance and lead to price declines with resulting losses for those involved.
The Singapore government followed up last week by restricting the amount of land it will sell in the first half of next year to about the same level it made available in the second half of this year, versus some expectations for a hike. While this risks helping to drive land prices up further it will at least reduce the chances of overbuilding.
""The government is concerned about the manner and speed with which land prices are rising,"" said Desmond Sim, research head for Singapore and Southeast Asia at real estate services firm CBRE. ""The government wants to keep Singapore property affordable for Singaporeans."" 
PUBLIC RESENTMENT
For now it is all jawboning, but analysts say the government and the central bank could intervene if the warnings go unheeded and if they see market instability.
Potential measures could include more stringent terms for buyers, curbing bank lending to developers or guidelines that may limit the units in a development.
""There have been calls for relaxation of measures, but it could be the other way around now - tightening,"" said Alice Tan, head of research at real estate services firm Knight Frank Singapore.
The real estate market's prospects have often been key to investor confidence in Singapore, home to some of the world's most expensive property. Singapore real estate is considered a safe haven for Asia's super-rich, who helped push private home prices up more than 60 percent from 2009 to a record high in 2013.
Public resentment over rising housing prices and immigration, which was seen contributing to a higher cost of living, were highlighted in the 2011 election, which the ruling party won with its lowest ever share of the vote.
Since then, the government slowed the growth of foreign workers and introduced more property cooling measures, such as additional stamp duties and tougher mortgage conditions.
Over 15 successive quarters, prices dropped 11.6 percent, though they did finally start rising again in the third quarter of this year, with a gain of 0.7 percent recorded.
FEAR OF MISSING OUT
The developers and home buyers are certainly optimistic.
City Developments Ltd (SI:CTDM) and Keppel Corp's (SI:KPLM) real estate unit, both of which bought sites this year, told Reuters separately that they would continue to look for potential opportunities to buy land in Singapore.
""The underlying demand from owner occupiers will still be there and this will contribute to a healthy market,"" City Developments' CEO-designate Sherman Kwek said.
The optimism can also be found among potential home buyers. First-time buyer Rahi Shah, 30, has waited on the sidelines since 2014 when he perceived prices were ""way too high.""
He bought a three-bedroom condominium in August for over S$1 million ($750,000). ""I got it at the right time; prices were the lowest I had seen.""
Private home transactions have risen 32 percent to 21,375 in the first 11 months of 2017 from 16,137 for all of last year, according to real estate consultancy Colliers' analysis of official data as of Nov. 28.
Others, like IT sector employee Bernard Ng, are being driven into the market because of the fear of missing out on a good deal. ""If you don't buy now, it will be even more expensive next time,"" said Ng.

LONDON (Reuters) - Confidence among British businesses has picked up to its highest level since July as firms expect a busier 2018, though optimism remains well below its level before last year's Brexit vote, a survey by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed on Friday.
Lloyds' business barometer rose to +28 in December from +24 in November, compared with a pre-referendum average of +44.
Official data due at 0930 GMT is expected to confirm that British annual economic growth held at 1.5 percent in the three months to September, compared with an average of more than 2 percent before the referendum to leave the European Union.
""The results point to the economy continuing to expand in the fourth quarter at a similar pace to recent quarters,"" Lloyds economist Hann-Ju Ho said.
""However, larger companies reported the weakest business prospects as well as the biggest concerns about the impact of Brexit,"" he said.
Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May this month secured agreement from other EU countries to move talks on to trade and transitional arrangements, after progress on other issues.
But the EU is likely to restrict British access to its markets after any transition, unless May reverses her decision to put limits on migration from the bloc. Reducing migration was a key reason why many Britons voted to leave the EU.
Earlier this week IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said British economic growth was likely to slow further next year as businesses held off from investment in the run-up to Brexit and consumers suffered from high inflation.
A separate survey by market research firm YouGov and economics consultancy Cebr showed a partial recovery in consumer sentiment after it sank in November to its lowest since just after the Brexit vote.
December's monthly gain was the biggest since the start of the year and was driven by home-owners' greater optimism about house prices - a view at odds with most economists and property valuers, who see prices broadly flat next year.
Consumers' assessment of their personal financial situation was still the bleakest since January 2014.
The YouGov/Cebr survey was based on responses from 6,000 people over the past month. The Lloyds data came from 300 firms with annual sales of more than 1 million pounds ($1.34 million) questioned between Nov. 27 and Dec. 11. 
Britain's deal to advance to a second phase of divorce talks was clinched on Dec. 8.

The data, along with a better-than-expected 1.5 percent jump in October retail sales, sent the Canadian dollar higher against the greenback and raised expectations the Bank of Canada could increase rates as early as January after taking two hikes this year. 
""These reports do increase the odds of more aggressive tightening from the Bank of Canada in 2018,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Bets in the markets of an increase in January rose to 52.8 percent from 37.9 percent ahead of the data, while a March hike was nearly fully priced in. 
Governor Stephen Poloz said last week the central bank is increasingly confident the economy will need less stimulus over time.
Consumer prices were up in seven of the eight main consumer price categories, led by a 5.9 percent annual increase in the transportation component as gasoline prices accelerated.
Food prices were up 1.6 percent as consumers paid more for meat and fresh vegetables. 
A 3.3 percent increase in motor vehicle sales lifted retail sales. Vehicle sales have been robust this year, putting 2017 on track to hit 2 million for the first time.
Retail sales volumes were also strong, up 1.4 percent, prompting economists at CIBC to lift their forecast for Friday's October growth data to 0.3 percent. Economists polled by Reuters expect a 0.2 percent increase.
Separate data from payrolls processor ADP showed companies added 59,200 workers to their payrolls in November on gains in education and health care. 
The new report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, is derived from payrolls data of about 40,000 companies.

The more closely watched Statistics Canada report, which is based on a survey of about 56,000 households, earlier this month showed 79,500 jobs were created in November.

Manufacturing output probably rose 9.0 percent in November from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts, slowing from October's 14.6 percent expansion. 
That would be the slowest year-on-year increase since May, when industrial production grew 4.6 percent.
On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, manufacturing output is seen edging up 0.7 percent, which would be the same as the growth pace recorded in October.
The November performance of industrial output could affect economists' expectations for Singapore's advance estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product, due to be released in January.

In the third quarter, the city-state's economy grew 5.2 percent from a year earlier, the quickest pace in nearly four years, thanks to a boom in manufacturing that some analysts say will encourage tighter monetary policy in 2018.

Based on data released over the final quarter, the report could prove good news for the parties preparing to start talks on forming a new coalition government in January, suggesting there may be fiscal space to deliver on some of the pricier social policy demands set by the Social Democrats (SPD).
""The favorable economic conditions and all the latest monthly indicators suggest that the economic upswing will continue in coming months,"" the ministry said. ""In the mid-term, it should slacken and return to the potential growth path.""
A survey by the Munich-based Ifo institute on Tuesday said economic uncertainty over a record delay in forming a government was beginning to cloud the outlook for businesses as they contemplated making further investments.
Although the institute's business climate index came in below a Reuters consensus forecast, economists said the economic buoyancy was set to continue.
The buoyant economy yielded rising tax returns, the finance ministry said, with income tax revenues going up 5.6 percent over the previous year and turnover tax take up 6.3 percent.
The positive news came as Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives gear up for tricky talks in January on forming a government with the Social Democrats (SPD). 
Solid government revenues could help the SPD overcome nervousness about risking further voter disenchantment if they enter a renewed ""grand coalition"" with Merkel. 

The party's restive membership hopes to set a distinctive, and potentially expensive, social democratic stamp on any government program in wide areas of labor, health and education policy.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 03:34PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales hit 11-year high, supply still tight","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in November, hitting their highest level in nearly 11 years, the latest indication that housing was regaining momentum after almost stalling this year.
The report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors also added to data ranging from the labor market to retail sales that have suggested the economy was ending 2017 on a strong note.
""The greater home sales will stoke the fires for stronger economic growth next year as consumers spend more to furnish their new homes with new appliances and furniture and all the decorations and trimmings,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist MUFG in New York.
Existing home sales surged 5.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.81 million units last month amid continued recovery in areas in the South ravaged by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and solid gains in other parts of the country. 
That was the highest level since December 2006 and marked the third straight monthly rise. Economists had forecast home sales rising only 0.9 percent to a 5.52 million-unit rate in November. 
Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales. They rose 3.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in November. Sales in the South, which accounts for almost half of the existing homes sales market, increased 8.3 percent last month. Sales rose 6.7 percent in the Northeast and jumped 8.4 percent in the Midwest. 
They, however, fell 2.3 percent in the West, which has seen an acceleration in house price increases. While the housing market is expected to continue growing next year, there are concerns that a Republican overhaul of the U.S. tax code could hurt sales at the high end of the market. 
The biggest overhaul of the tax system in more than 30 years, which could be signed into law by President Donald Trump soon, will cap the deduction for mortgage interest at $750,000 in home loan value for residences bought from Jan. 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2025.
The cap would revert to $1 million in loan value after Dec. 31, 2025.
""We expect further increases in sales in 2018, although tax reform is likely to modestly reduce demand at the high end as well as to lower prices for high-priced homes,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus Ohio.
The report came on the heels of data this week showing homebuilder confidence vaulting to a near 18-1/2-year high in December and single-family homebuilding and permits rising in November to levels last seen in the third quarter of 2007.
Housing is expected to contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, outperforming a broadly flat stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE 
Despite the recent gains, home resales remain constrained by a chronic shortage of houses at the lower end of the market, which is keeping prices elevated and sidelining some first-time buyers, who accounted for 29 percent of transactions last month.
Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market. 
The number of previously owned homes on the market dropped 9.7 percent to 1.67 million units in November from a year ago, the second lowest reading since 1999. Housing inventory has dropped for 30 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
At November's sales pace, it would take a record low 3.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.9 months in October. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
With supply tightening, the median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $248,000 in November. That was the 69th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.9 percent since the 2007/09 recession ended.
The government reported on Tuesday that groundbreaking on single-family homes, which account for the largest share of the housing market, jumped 5.3 percent in November to the highest level since September 2007. Housing completions continued to lag at a rate of 1.116 million units.

Realtors estimate that the housing starts and completions rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

The industry data showed that home resales increased by 5.6% in November to a seasonally adjusted 5.81 million units from 5.50 million units in the previous month which was revised up from 5.48 million.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.9% rise to 5.54 million units in November.
After last month’s increase, sales are 3.8% higher than a year ago and are at their strongest pace since December 2006 (6.42 million).
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
In the report, NAR noted that existing home sales had surged for a third straight month, reaching their fasts pace in almost 11 years and that all major regions except for the West saw a significant hike in sales activity last month.
“Faster economic growth in recent quarters, the booming stock market and continuous job gains are fueling substantial demand for buying a home as 2017 comes to an end,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun explained in the release.
The report also showed that median existing-home price for all housing types in November was $248,000, up 5.8% from the same month in 2016 ($234,400). November's price increase marks the 69th straight month of year-over-year gains.
“Price appreciation is too fast in a lot of markets right now,” Yun commented, adding that “the increase in homebuilder optimism must translate to significantly more new construction in 2018 to help ease these acute inventory shortages.”

914,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>","Column: Student tax breaks survive the tax bill, make the most of them","By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are going to college, getting extra training for a job, or paying off student loans, there are myriad tax breaks worth thousands of dollars to people burdened by college costs. 
Although many were threatened in early versions of the tax bills crafted by the Senate and House and Representatives, students can breathe a sigh of relief that the benefits all remain. Tax experts suggest using these strategies before the end of December to get every penny possible:
* Student loan interest deduction
About 12.4 million borrowers make use of this deduction. You can deduct up to $2,500 in interest per year, which can result in tax savings that for some top $600. 
The deduction depends on how much you have paid in a single tax year toward your student loans and also depends on your income.
If your loan payments made so far for 2017 do not qualify for the $2,500 maximum deduction and you are still paying off student loans, consider paying more before the end of the year to boost the deduction, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of www.Cappex.com. You can find out how much interest you have paid so far this year from the student loan servicer that collects your monthly payments.
To take the full $2,500 deduction, an individual cannot have a modified adjusted gross income over $65,000, and for couples $135,000. For individuals with incomes up to $80,000 and for married couples earning up to $165,000, smaller deductions apply.
Paying extra by Dec. 31 would be particularly wise if your income next year is likely to put you over the income cutoff, said Gil Charney, director of tax and policy analysis for The Tax Institute at H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). 
* College credits
Both the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit provide tax breaks to help pay for education, but apply to different stages. 
For undergrads, the American Opportunity Credit is worth up to $2,500 per year, but can be used only for the first four years of college. Students must attend at least half-time. 
If you have not paid enough tuition and fees to qualify for the full credit this year and have been billed for the first quarter or semester in 2018, consider paying the bill now to maximize the 2017 credit, Charney said. The credit covers 100 percent of the first $2,000 in tuition and fees paid in a year; then 25 percent of the next $2,000.
Remember, there are income limits. You can't get the full credit with modified adjusted gross income over $80,000; $160,000 for couples.
If your income will exceed the limit in 2018 but qualifies in 2017, this would be the year to capture as much as possible.
The same strategy applies to the Lifetime Learning Credit, which is valuable to part-time students, graduate students or workers trying to enhance job opportunities with an extra course or training.
The Lifetime Learning Credit is worth $2,000, or 20 percent of the first $10,000 spent in a year. So consider paying ahead for 2018 education, especially if you are near an income cutoff: over $56,000 in modified adjusted gross income for individuals, or $112,000 for couples for the maximum credit. 
Keep in mind that if two spouses are going to school they cannot both claim the $2,000; it is a maximum per household. The American Opportunity Credit is kinder because it applies per student. Parents with three children in college at the same time could claim the credit for each child and do it annually for the four years a child is in an undergraduate program.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 03:10AM ET</span>",Neglected Swedish crown set to win some love at last,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The Swedish crown's struggle as one of the whipping boys of European currencies may be nearly over.
Despite a reasonably bright economy and red-hot property market, Sweden's Riksbank has fought furiously against crown strength in recent years and there is intensifying speculation it may be about to relent when it meets this week.
In the Riksbank's battle against dangerous overvaluation of the crown during a period of extraordinarily loose monetary policy at the European Central Bank, Sweden's official interest rates have been slashed to the second lowest in the world.
The Riksbank's main policy rate stands at a minus half a percentage point, more deeply negative than the ECB's at minus 40 basis points and Japan's at minus 10 basis points. Only Switzerland, at minus 75 basis points, is more negative.
Even though the contrast between these sub-zero rates and the economy's brisk growth prospects and red-hot property market attracted some funds towards the crown earlier this year, its weakness persisted and forced many to cut and run.
But with market positioning much more lighter and Sweden's central bank likely to follow its Norwegian and European counterparts in gradually unwinding years of unconventional policy stimulus, there is renewed optimism about the unit.
John Taylor, a fixed income portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in London who purchased the Swedish crown against the euro around the 10 kroner per euro, said the odds are increasing for the Riksbank to start rolling back its unconventional policies this week.
""The economy is doing well and the Riksbank officials have become less comfortable with the currency’s weakness in recent days, suggesting that they might follow the Norges Bank in signaling a quicker path for interest rate normalization."" 
A majority of analysts in a Reuters poll published last week see the Riksbank signaling an end to the current quantitative easing program and keeping interest rates steady at a policy decision on Wednesday. 
Norway's central bank, which also has its main policy rate at minus 50 basis points, surprised markets last week when it suggested that it will start raising interest rates as early as next year, compared to market expectations of late 2019, sending its currency higher against its major rivals.
LIGHT POSITIONS
The crown's near 7 percent decline against the euro (EURSEK=D3) over the last three months has pushed investors out of their long positions. They had added bets in the first half of the year.
""Market positioning is very light as long positions have become steadily unwound in recent weeks thanks to the euro's move higher against the kroner,"" said Michael Sneyd, global head of FX strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London.
Derivative markets are also indicative about the light positioning in the foreign exchange markets with one-month risk reversal, an indicator of how much crown calls are purchased relative to puts, falling substantially from a one-year high hit earlier this year. 
To be sure, some investors such as Alastair Smith, partner at Harmonic Capital Partners, a hedge fund in London, said the quality of the inflows into Swedish equity markets showed that long-term investors still remained wary of the currency. 
""We don't think the Swedish currency is out of the woods yet judging by the quality of the capital flows that has gone into the local equity markets,"" Smith said.
But bond markets have proved to be a different story.
Investors have been drawn to Sweden's covered bonds which boast of a ""AAA"" rating, backed by mortgages, and offer a juicier yield pickup than its counterparts in the government bond markets.
Moreover, unconventional monetary policies pursued by the Riksbank in recent months have meant that maturities up to 10-year segments are heavily owned by the central bank with scarcer yields than available elsewhere.
""We like the Swedish covered bonds market as that offers a juicier yield pickup of about 50-70 basis points compared to the government bonds space,"" Bernstein's Taylor said.

DOMESTIC FACTORS
In Sweden's case, domestic factors have clouded the currency's outlook, particularly housing prices that have doubled in the last decade and made some investors wary of a sharp downturn that might hurt the broader financial system.
While regulators have forced banks to hold bigger buffers to mitigate the risks, one macro strategist at a hedge fund in London said the housing price situation was ""the major factor for unwinding long Swedish crown bets.""
The crown has fallen nearly 4 percent so far this year against the euro (EURSEK=), outstripping the 3.4 percent decline of the British pound against the euro (EURGBP=). 
Growing annual pension fund-related outflows have also played a part in weakening the crown to more than 10 crowns per euro, its lowest since November 2016 last week. 
This year, annual outflows to overseas investments from Swedish pension funds will total 26 billion Swedish crowns ($3.07 billion) in December, the most in nearly two decades, according to Karl Steiner, chief quantitative FX strategist at Stockholm-based SEB.
Steiner said the crown may have likely peaked around the 10 per euro level and may head to 9.20 in the coming weeks if the Riksbank doesn't strike a dovish stance next week. ""We are quite constructive about the currency's outlook,"" he said. (For a graphic on Sweden Bond Yields click http://reut.rs/2kyhmV4)

In July, a Singapore court jailed Yeo for 4-1/2 years for money laundering and cheating in a case linked to investigations into the siphoning of billions of dollars from Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it has issued a permanent prohibition order against Yeo, effective Monday, and a three-year ban for former chief executive of financial advisory firm NRA Capital, Kevin Scully.
""NRA had been appointed to perform the valuation of PetroSaudi Oil Services Limited (PSOSL),"" MAS said in a press release. 
""Mr Scully had failed to ensure that NRA’s valuation of PSOSL was carried out with sufficient care, judgment and objectivity,"" the central bank added.
MAS has now issued prohibition orders against eight people involved in 1MDB-related breaches, following two bans announced last month.
Once a pet project of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chaired its advisory board, 1MDB is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing.

Singapore's central bank had said in May that it had ended its two-year review of banks with 1MDB-linked transactions.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 08:10PM ET</span>","World Bank raises China 2017 growth forecast, maintains 2018 outlook","BEIJING (Reuters) - The World Bank on Tuesday raised its forecast for China's economic growth in 2017 to 6.8 percent from 6.7 percent it projected in October, as personal consumption and foreign trade supported growth.
But the Washington-based lender kept its forecast for China's 2018 and 2019 GDP growth unchanged at 6.4 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, due to less accommodative monetary policy and the government's effort to rein in credit and control leverage. 
The key downside risks to the forecast are the still rising leverage of the non-financial sector and uncertainty around housing prices. 
""Despite the recent slowdown, credit continues to grow considerably faster than GDP. Outstanding bank loans reached 150 percent of GDP in November 2017, up from 103 percent at the end of 2007,"" the World Bank said in its China Economic Update. 
China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent over the first nine months of the year, but Beijing's campaign to reduce risks in the financial sector has pushed up borrowing costs, raising concerns GDP growth could take a hit next year. 
But strong growth so far this year has given policymakers an opportunity to accelerate deleveraging, which is ""likely to come at the cost of slower GDP growth in the near term but will improve China's long-term economic prospects,"" the World Bank report said. 

External risks to China's economy include the potential for more restrictive trade policies in advanced economies, and geopolitical tensions, the report said.

Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that growth in global industrial production was likely to have increased further in October. The pick-up had been broadly based geographically. Survey measures suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sectors of Australia's largest trading partners had continued to improve; conditions in the services sectors of the major advanced economies had remained favourable. The strength of industrial production in the high-income economies of east Asia had been associated with very strong growth in exports of electronics, specifically of semiconductors. The strength of demand in electronics-related industries had supported business investment and GDP growth in the region, particularly in South Korea.
GDP growth in the major advanced economies had been above potential, supported by accommodative monetary policies. Members noted that recent growth outcomes for the euro area had been stronger than expected. Growth in business investment had picked up in the major advanced economies over the prior year and further solid growth was anticipated over coming quarters. Consumption growth had remained above average, supported by robust growth in employment.
Conditions in labour markets in a number of major advanced economies had continued to tighten. Employment-to-population ratios had increased and unemployment rates had declined to low levels in Japan, Germany and the United States, among other advanced economies. Members noted that this implied there was limited spare capacity in these economies, based on conventional measures of full employment. However, wage growth had picked up only slightly. While observing that there were typically lags between labour markets tightening and wage pressures emerging, members noted that the wage data might suggest these economies had more spare capacity than implied by conventional measures. More generally, members noted that the nature of work was evolving, driven partly by technological change, and that not everyone was benefiting equally from the recent strength in labour demand. Low wage outcomes had contributed to core inflation in the major advanced economies remaining low, even though producer price inflation had been noticeably higher.
In China, GDP growth had been stronger than expected over the first three quarters of 2017, but more recently growth looked to have eased. This was particularly true of residential construction activity in cities where the authorities had implemented policies to address buoyant housing market conditions. The output of some sectors producing inputs for the construction sector, such as glass and steel products, had fallen in preceding months. Production shutdowns designed to deal with environmental concerns had also affected crude steel production. In combination, these factors had led to some levelling off of Chinese bulk commodity imports, including from Australia. Despite this, spot prices for iron ore had increased over the previous month and Chinese producer price inflation had remained elevated, partly reflecting stronger commodity prices. Although consumer price inflation in China had edged higher, it remained below the authorities' objective of 3 per cent in 2017.
Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the wage price index continued to suggest that wage growth had been stable at a low rate. The outcome for the September quarter had been slightly lower than expected, despite the 3.3 per cent increase in award and minimum wages in the quarter, as previously determined by the Fair Work Commission. (The award system directly covers around one-quarter of the workforce.) Wage growth in the health and education sectors remained above the national average and a number of sectors had seen an increase in year-ended wage growth compared with a year prior. This had occurred at the same time as spare capacity appeared to have declined and more firms had been reporting difficulty finding suitable labour. The forecast was still for wage growth to increase gradually over the next year or so.
Labour market conditions had remained positive and had been stronger than expected over the previous year. Employment had increased a little in October and growth over the previous year had been well above average. Full-time employment had risen sharply and was growing at around its fastest pace in a decade. The participation rate was notably higher than a year earlier, particularly for women and older workers, who had been staying in the labour force for longer. The unemployment rate had edged lower to be 5.4 per cent in October, which was its lowest level since 2013, and unemployment rates had been on a downward trend in most states. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggested employment growth would be somewhat above average over the next few quarters.
Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting and that recent data suggested GDP growth over the year to the September quarter was likely to have picked up to around the economy's potential growth rate.
Information on components of household consumption indicated that growth in aggregate household consumption had moderated in the September quarter; growth in retail sales volumes and motor vehicle sales to households had been subdued. The growth in the value of retail sales in October was consistent with reports from the Bank's liaison suggesting that moderate growth in consumption had continued into the December quarter.
Dwelling investment was expected to have fallen marginally in the September quarter. Dwelling investment had fallen over the preceding year in Queensland and Western Australia, but had remained at a high level in New South Wales and Victoria. Residential building approvals had picked up in preceding months, but remained below the levels of a few years earlier. Together with data on the pipeline of work yet to be done, this suggested that dwelling investment would remain at a high level for the following year or so, but that it was not likely to add materially to GDP growth.
Conditions had eased in the established housing market, most noticeably in Sydney, where housing prices had declined in prior months and auction clearance rates had fallen. Housing price growth had also eased in Melbourne, but remained relatively strong, supported by high population growth. Housing prices in Perth and Brisbane had been little changed in preceding months.
Members observed that business conditions in the non-mining sector had been above average for most industries over the preceding year or so and that non-mining profits had been increasing. Non-mining business investment looked to have risen further in the September quarter and the prospects for continued growth were positive: investment intentions had been revised higher, particularly for the business services sector; survey measures of capacity utilisation had remained well above average; and private non-residential building approvals had remained strong. Mining investment looked to have been little changed in the September quarter, although declines were still anticipated over the next few quarters.
Growth in public investment had picked up over the preceding few years, driven by infrastructure investment. Further growth was expected over the following couple of years, based on projections in state and federal budgets. Members considered macroeconomic modelling of a scenario under which public investment was higher than forecast for the following three years. The demand effects of this scenario included the direct contribution to GDP growth of higher public investment, as well as the multiplier effects through higher profits earned by private sector firms and the higher incomes earned by workers on these projects. Members noted the possibility of ‘crowding out’ of other forms of demand, but did not consider this a major risk given that the economy was currently operating with a degree of spare capacity and inflation was low. Indeed, a sustained pick-up in spending on public infrastructure could even ‘crowd in’ additional investment by the private sector firms undertaking those projects on the public sector's behalf. Members also noted that the higher level of infrastructure investment could boost productivity in the economy.
Members noted that conditions in financial markets generally had been little changed over the previous month, with volatility having remained at a low level throughout 2017. Financial conditions generally remained very accommodative, despite the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus in some economies over 2017. However, there had been a noticeable tightening in financial market conditions in China over the year, including in response to regulatory measures.
Market pricing suggested that market participants expected the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to increase the federal funds rate at its December meeting, consistent with the median of FOMC members' projections. However, market pricing continued to suggest a more modest increase in the federal funds rate over 2018 than implied by the median FOMC projection. Members noted that previously announced changes to the composition of the FOMC had not affected market analysts' expectations regarding the stance of US monetary policy. Regulations – particularly on smaller financial institutions – were under review, although members noted that core reforms relevant to capital, liquidity, stress testing and resolution planning were likely to be preserved.
Members observed that the yield on long-term US government bonds had been little changed over preceding months, whereas the yield on shorter-term US government bonds had increased. This in part reflected expectations for an increase in the federal funds rate and the US Treasury shifting its issuance towards securities at shorter maturities. Long-term government bond yields in other major financial markets had also generally remained little changed at low levels.
Members noted that while yields on Australian 10-year government bonds had been little changed, their spread to US Treasury bond yields had declined to a low level over preceding months.
Financing conditions remained favourable for corporations across major markets. Although spreads of high-yield corporate bonds to government bonds had increased a little in November, they remained at very low levels. Also, equity valuations remained high, having risen over 2017, although there had been small declines in some markets over November.
There had been little change in most major exchange rates over November. The US dollar had appreciated a little since early September on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting increased prospects for both future increases in the federal funds rate and US fiscal stimulus. Members noted that while the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 5 per cent in trade-weighted terms over this period, it had moved within a relatively narrow range over the previous two and a half years and was a little higher than the level of early 2016.
In China, a broad range of policy actions had contributed to a tightening in financial market conditions since late 2016 and a reduction in leverage within the financial system. Recent regulatory announcements had been directed towards managing risks in the shadow banking sector. Members noted that Chinese equity valuations had risen strongly over 2017, but had fallen somewhat in November after the authorities had signalled their concern that some stocks were overvalued.
In Australia, housing credit growth had eased a little over the second half of 2017, as growth in lending to owner-occupiers had slowed somewhat and growth in lending to investors had stabilised at a lower level than in the first half of the year. The easing in housing credit growth had been accounted for by the major banks, which had been more affected by the need to restrain interest-only lending to comply with the supervisory measures announced earlier in the year. Growth in housing lending by non-authorised deposit-taking institutions (non-ADIs) had picked up, although these institutions' share of overall housing lending remained small. Members noted that these lenders charged higher interest rates on average than ADIs, which is likely to reflect both the borrower risk profile and higher funding costs of non-ADIs.
Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities, which are an important source of funding for non-ADIs, had been strong in 2017 and pricing of these securities had declined a little. Major banks' funding costs had declined a little over 2017 and long-term debt funding had grown relatively strongly in the second half of the year.
Members observed that the Australian equity market (on an accumulation basis) had risen in line with global markets over the previous couple of years and that volatility had remained low over the prior year. Australian share prices had been little changed over the preceding month, although banks' share prices had declined, partly in response to lower-than-expected profit increases.
Financial market prices continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the following year or so.
Members concluded their review of developments in financial markets with a detailed discussion of Australian businesses' access to finance. They noted that external finance had become available on increasingly favourable terms for large businesses over recent years, with foreign banks having added to competition for large business lending. Nevertheless, business borrowing had grown only moderately, reflecting subdued mergers and acquisitions activity, with investment having been funded largely from internal sources of funds. In contrast, many small businesses continued to find it challenging to obtain finance, particularly in their start-up or expansion phases. Members noted that this was likely to reflect the riskier nature of such lending, but also the less competitive market for small business lending. Participants on the Bank's Small Business Finance Advisory Panel, convened annually, had confirmed the challenges of accessing bank lending. Members observed that equity funding was often more appropriate for the risk profile of start-up businesses, but that there are relatively few avenues for such financing in Australia compared with some other markets. Members were encouraged by the potential for innovations to improve access to finance for small businesses and the willingness of regulators to facilitate these developments, including in the areas of comprehensive credit reporting, open banking and alternative funding platforms.
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global economy had improved over 2017 and that the outlook had also been upgraded. This improvement had been supported by expansionary financial conditions, notwithstanding some withdrawal of monetary stimulus in a number of economies. In the major advanced economies, labour market conditions had continued to tighten, but wage growth and core inflation had remained low. Members recognised that this combination of strength in economic activity and low inflation was a central issue in the global economy. It was possible that this combination could continue for a while yet, but it was also possible that inflation could pick up by more than expected as spare capacity diminished.
Although the global growth outlook had improved, commodity prices and Australia's terms of trade were expected to decline in the period ahead, but to remain at relatively high levels. The Australian dollar had continued to fluctuate within its range of the preceding two and a half years. An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in domestic economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
Members noted that the low level of interest rates had been supporting the Australian economy. Recent data suggested that GDP growth had been around its trend rate over the year to the September quarter. Output growth was still expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period. Business conditions were positive and capacity utilisation had remained high. The outlook for non-mining business investment had improved further and the pick-up in public infrastructure investment was also supporting overall growth. However, growth in consumption was expected to have slowed in the September quarter and the outlook for household consumption continued to be a significant risk, given that household incomes were growing slowly and debt levels were high.
Growth in employment, particularly full-time employment, had increased and the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low. Although wage growth had been a little lower than expected in the September quarter, it appeared to have stabilised at a low rate. Leading indicators of labour demand had been broadly consistent with continuing strength in the labour market. In these circumstances, spare capacity in the labour market was expected to be absorbed gradually and wage growth was expected to pick up over time.
Housing market conditions had generally eased, especially in Sydney. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. To address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority had introduced a number of supervisory measures earlier in the year and credit standards had been tightened to lower the risk profile of borrowers. Growth in household credit had slowed somewhat, but members agreed that household balance sheets still warranted careful monitoring.
Over the prior year or so, the unemployment rate had fallen and inflation had moved closer to target. Members noted that this had occurred at the same time as risks in household balance sheets had lessened. Recent data had increased confidence that there would be further progress on these fronts over the following year. How far and when stronger conditions in the economy and labour market might feed through into higher wage growth and inflation remained important considerations shaping the outlook. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."
926,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",UK factories enjoy another three-decade high for orders: CBI,"LONDON (Reuters) - British factories matched a three-decade high for orders this month, a survey showed, adding to signs that manufacturers are riding high even as Britain's Brexit-bound economy remains slow.
Factories have benefited from an economic recovery elsewhere in Europe and beyond, and from the fall in the value of the pound after last year's referendum decision to leave the European Union.
The Confederation of British Industry said on Monday its industrial order book balance remained at +17 in December, its joint highest level since August 1988. 
The survey's gauge of export orders edged down to +16 from +20 in November which was its highest level since 1995. 
Manufacturing accounts for only 10 percent of Britain's economy. 
But the Bank of England hopes exports can soften the hit to overall growth from lower spending by consumers at home who have been pinched by a rise in inflation caused by sterling's fall.
Data published last week showed retail sales in the three months to November recorded the slowest growth in more than four years, despite a bounce last month linked to Black Friday sales promotions.
Howard Archer, an economist with EY Item Club, a forecasting organization, said as well as helping exporters, the weaker pound appeared to have encouraged some firms to switch to domestic sources for supplies.
Samuel Tombs, an economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the CBI survey suggested many factories were now running at full capacity. 
""The risk, then, is that the UK economy fails to capitalize fully on the recovery in global trade and remains the Group of Seven's laggard next year,"" he said.
Despite the recent strength in orders, the CBI's gauge of factory output expectations for the next three months remained at +13, its lowest since October 2016, while manufacturers expected their prices would rise at the fastest rate since June.

The survey of 371 manufacturers was conducted between Nov. 22 and Dec. 12.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 12:14AM ET</span>","Japan exports boom, but inflation not following script in blow to Bank of Japan exit plan","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese exports accelerated sharply in November, yet again pointing to growing momentum in the world's third-biggest economy. There was just one catch: inflation remained stubbornly low and well off the central bank's 2 percent target.
The combination of steady growth and benign consumer prices mean the Bank of Japan will lag other major central banks in exiting crisis-era monetary stimulus, with analysts widely expecting BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to keep the liquidity tap wide open at a meeting later this week.
""Inflation expectation is in a gradual recovery trend, but a gap between firm economic indicators and weak price indexes remains wide open,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
Indeed, a BOJ survey on Monday showed companies' inflation expectations heightened only a touch in December from three months ago, despite a tight labor market and business confidence at over a decade high.
The persistently low inflation - with core prices running at an annual pace of 0.8 percent - was also hard to square off with the robust performance of Japan Inc., which has benefited from booming exports thanks to upbeat global demand. [nL3N1NZ241
Separate data from the Ministry of Finance showed exports grew 16.2 percent in the year to November, beating a 14.6 percent gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll and accelerating from the prior month's 14.0 percent increase, led by a stellar sales to China and Asia.
Economists expect brisk Asia-bound shipments of electronics and solid capital investment in advanced economies will underpin Japan's export performance in coming months.
""The global economic outlook by IMF and OECD suggests the world economy will remain resilient for the time being, which will provide favourable export conditions,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
That upbeat outlook was highlighted in the BOJ's tankan survey on business sentiment last week, which showed big manufacturers' optimism hit an 11-year high.
All of this has helped Japan's economy score its second-longest run of postwar growth. That marked a feather in the cap of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe whose 'Abenomics' stimulus policies have put the nation on the cusp of vanquishing nearly two decades of deflation.
INFLATION, ANYONE? 
Many economists, however, are skeptical that consumer price gains will keep up with growth in overall economic activity. 
And earlier this month, Kuroda signaled the BOJ may edge away from its crisis-mode stimulus, saying keeping it for too long could undermine regional banks' health.
""The BOJ will likely be forced into cutting its price projections once again in its quarterly outlook report in January. That will highlight a distance to an exit from the BOJ's monetary stimulus,"" said Barclays' Nagai.
The BOJ quarterly ""tankan"" survey on corporate inflation expectations survey showed companies expect consumer prices to rise 0.8 percent a year from now, slightly ahead of their projection for a 0.7 percent increase three months ago.
The marginal nudge up in expectations underscored why inflation is still well off the BOJ's target, with firms expecting consumer prices to rise an annual 1.1 percent three years from now and 1.1 percent five years ahead, unchanged from three months ago, the survey showed. 
On the external front, the news continued to look up for Japan, offering hope that a much-anticipated virtual circle of private sector-led growth will boost consumption and prices. 
The value of exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 25.1 percent year-on-year in November to 1.38 trillion yen ($12.24 billion), the highest monthly amount on record, led by equipment to manufacture liquid crystal displays (LCD).
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's exports, grew 20.4 percent in the year to November to 3.89 trillion yen, the record amount.
Exports to the United States rose 13.0 percent in the year to November, led by cars and excavators, following a 7.1 percent gain in the previous month.
""The upshot is that net exports should have provided another boost to GDP growth in the current quarter,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S. state, local tax revenue growth slows in second quarter","By Robin Respaut
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. state and local government tax revenues increased 1.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, more slowly than the 2.2 percent average for the previous four quarters, the Rockefeller Institute of Government said in a report released on Friday.
The deceleration stemmed largely from reductions in state personal income tax revenue and probably helped prevent a record 11 states from filing timely budgets for fiscal year 2018.
Overall, revenue increased from sales taxes and rose substantially from corporate income taxes. 
The Rockefeller Institute's preliminary data for the third quarter indicates stronger growth in personal income taxes at 4.7 percent and a modest rise in sales tax revenue at 2.7 percent. 
The Rockefeller Institute cautioned that the growth in corporate income tax revenue in the second quarter might have stemmed from changes to filing deadlines. As a result, persistent declines in that revenue could reappear in the future.
States fared better than local governments in the second quarter, with tax revenue up 2.7 percent, compared with weak 1 percent average growth in the prior four quarters. Those governments benefited from higher revenue from sales and corporate income taxes. 
Local tax revenue grew by 1.7 percent, more slowly than the 3.6 percent average quarterly increase during the prior year. Those governments collected less in sales taxes and faced slower growth in property taxes, their largest single source of revenue.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 09:30AM ET</span>","Irish GDP skewed again, but 'real' growth very strong","By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Statistical distortions catapulted Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) index to apparent annual growth of 10.5 percent in the third quarter, but underlying data nevertheless showed the real economy performing very strongly.
The relevance of using GDP as an accurate measure in Europe's fastest growing economy was called into question last year when 2015 growth figures were adjusted up to 26 percent after a massive revision to the stock of capital assets related to Ireland's large multinational sector.
This time net exports were flattered greatly by an absence of large imports of intellectual property and aircraft leasing activity, which have skewed data in the past. That pushed GDP up 4.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, ensuring the series remains ""an analyst's nightmare"", Davy Stockbrokers wrote in a note.
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) said that even if there was no growth in the final quarter, the final figure for 2017 would still come in close to 7 percent. China's economy is forecast to grow by 6.5 percent this year.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said GDP was likely to beat official forecasts for growth of 5.1 percent this year.
""Notwithstanding the well-known limitations with GDP, it is clear that the recovery continues to outperform expectations and while this is to be welcomed, it creates its own challenges,"" Donohoe said in a statement.
""In particular, if the economy continues to grow in excess of its potential, capacity constraints will begin to emerge. In these circumstances, it is essential that budgetary policy does not contribute to overheating. This is one of the defining economic challenges facing the Government.""
Irish GDP growth is almost certain to be the best in Europe for the fourth successive year, and a host of more consistent data economists prefer - from tumbling unemployment to robust retail sales - have been very strong in that period.
The statistics office has begun to phase in a new measure - ""Modified Gross National Income"", or ""GNI*"" - which strips out the effects of multinational firms re-domiciling, relocating or depreciating their capital assets.
A quarterly published sub-index of the new series - modified final domestic demand, which removes some of those globalized activities - rose by 2.4 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 5 percent on the year.
Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at the CSO, pointed to that as a figure that gives a more accurate picture of actual activity in the economy.
""Ireland continues to be a hyper-globalized economy but the core observation we can make is that the Irish consumer is in a sweet spot and they now have the confidence to spend,"" said Fergal O'Brien, chief economist at Irish business lobby IBEC.
""Solid wage growth, no inflation and very strong employment growth has created really strong momentum in the economy while construction is recovering and there are no major flashing lights in relation to Brexit impacts in the trading position.""

Overall industrial output rose 0.2 percent following an upwardly revised 1.2 percent gain in October. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output rising 0.3 percent last month. The U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector is comprised of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. 
Output in the mining sector registered a 2 percent gain as oil and gas extraction ""returned to normal levels"" after the impact of Hurricane Nate in October, the Fed said.
The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 12 percent of the nation's economy, rose 0.2 percent last month following an upwardly revised 1.4 percent gain in October. 
Output in the utilities sector, however, fell 1.9 percent on weak output among electricity providers. 

The percentage of industrial capacity in use rose slightly to 77.1 percent in November from an unrevised 77.0 percent in October. The November figure was 2.8 percentage points below the long-run average from 1972 to 2016.

The fall reflected how households felt about their personal finances over the past 12 months and a loss of confidence in the outlook for the economy since the referendum decision to take Britain out of the European Union, the BoE said.
""Households' expectations of income and spending have both increased since last year, which likely reflects the rise in cost of living following the depreciation of sterling,"" the BoE said as it published the survey by polling firm NMG Consulting.
Britain's inflation rate has jumped to 3.1 percent, pushed up largely by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, while wages have grown more weakly.
The BoE raised rates for the first time in more than 10 years last month, pushing up Bank Rate to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent. At the time, it said it expected little impact on British households from the change.
Friday's survey showed a slight deterioration in the balance sheets of British households over the past year although the share of households which spend more than 40 percent of their income on mortgage debt remained low, the BoE said.
The survey also suggested only one in 40 households in Britain with a mortgage was likely to spend less or work more hours in response to the BoE's decision to raise rates.
The share of households with mortgages likely to take action to offset higher borrowing costs would rise from 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent if the BoE raised rates by a further 25 basis points, according to the survey.

The online survey of 6,018 households was conducted between Sept. 6 and 26 and was considered by the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee before it voted to raise rates on Nov. 2.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 02:07AM ET</span>",Big Japanese manufacturers' mood hits 11-year high: tankan,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business confidence improved for a fifth straight quarter in the three months to December to hit an 11-year high, a central bank survey showed, a sign the economy is gathering momentum from robust exports and booming corporate profits.
But big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen in the next three months, highlighting their reluctance to embrace the improved operating environment via increases in wages and investment.
Nudging cash-rich firms into spending more on wages has been a priority for premier Shinzo Abe's efforts to vanquish the deflation that has plagued Japan for nearly two decades.
As part of those efforts, Abe's ruling coalition approved a plan on Thursday to slash the corporate tax rate - but only for companies that increase spending - a move that could brighten business sentiment in coming months.
The closely watched ""tankan"" survey also showed capacity constraints and staff shortages were increasing price pressures, which would help the Bank of Japan achieve its elusive 2 percent target but could squeeze corporate margins ahead.
Still, many analysts doubt wages will rise much and therefore expect any interest rate hikes to be some time away.
""The tankan results support the BOJ's bullish economic view backed by global economic recovery,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""But prices remain weak and far below the BOJ's price target. There's no way it can move to tighten policy anytime soon,"" he said.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 25 in December, the tankan showed on Friday, up from plus 22 in September and slightly higher than a median market forecast for plus 24.
It matched the high reached in December 2006, when a booming economy allowed the BOJ to end a previous spell of quantitative easing and zero interest rates.
An index measuring big non-manufacturers' sentiment was unchanged from September at plus 23, matching forecasts.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure for the current fiscal year to March 2018 by 7.4 percent, roughly in line with forecasts, the tankan showed.
PRICE PRESSURE BUILDING
The tankan showed that conditions for price and wage gains were gradually falling into place.
An index measuring employment conditions showed firms were faced with the most severe staff shortages since 1992, while their capacity to meet demand was at its tightest since 1991.
An index gauging output prices hit a nine-year high for big manufacturers, a sign that more large companies were in a position to raise prices - reflecting strong demand.
But analysts doubt whether the outlook for consumer prices will change much.
""Even looking at these figures, it doesn't provide enough energy for the BOJ to change its policy, such as, for example, changing its yield curve target or negative rates,"" said Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
The tankan will be among key data the BOJ will scrutinize at its next rate review on Dec. 20-21.
Japan's economy expanded an annualized 2.5 percent in the July-September period to mark a seventh straight quarter of expansion, supporting the central bank's recent signals that it could move away from crisis-era monetary policy.

But many analysts expect core consumer inflation, now at 0.8 percent, to slow next year unless firms pay heed to Abe's calls to hike wages by 3 percent.

936,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>",Canada home sales rise; household debt hits record,"By Andrea Hopkins and David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Resales of Canadian homes rose in November for the fourth straight month, the Canadian Real Estate Association said on Thursday, but it lowered its forecast for 2018 sales and prices because it expects stricter mortgage rules to dampen demand.
Separate data showed new home prices edged up by 0.1 percent in October, while Canadian household debt as a share of income hit a record high in the third quarter. This reinforced concerns that Canadians have taken on too much debt to get into the booming housing market.
Taken together, the three reports paint a picture of highly indebted households and a still-robust housing market that is expected to cool in 2018 as more tightening of mortgage rules takes effect.
Household debt rose to a record 171.1 percent in the third quarter and is expected to increase further this quarter as homebuyers try to complete deals before January, when a new banking stress test will make it harder to take on big mortgages.
But the ratio could flatten out in 2018 if the rule changes restrain homebuying and the debt that comes with it, Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note.
Sales of existing homes rose 3.9 percent in November from October nationwide and jumped 16 percent in the Toronto area, Canada's largest market, the real estate association said. But it cautioned that the looming stress tests might have pulled activity forward.
Sales were up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, while home prices gained 9.3 percent on the year, continuing a steady deceleration as the cumulative effect of tighter mortgage rules and a foreign buyers tax in Toronto and Vancouver reduced demand.
The association forecast a 5.3 percent drop in sales activity in 2018. Three months ago, it had expected a 2.3 percent decline. 
The national average price is expected to fall 1.4 percent to C$503,100 ($391,865) in 2018 after a 4.2 percent rise in 2017. In October, the group had forecast a milder 0.6 percent decline.

The separate Statistics Canada report on new home prices, which make up a far smaller segment of the housing market, showed modest increases of 0.1 percent for Toronto and 0.3 percent for Vancouver. They had been the nation's hottest markets.

937,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 10:31AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Pare Losses After Storage Data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures initially pared losses in North American trade on Thursday, after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. declined more than expected last week.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 8, while analysts had forecast a decline of 60 billion.
After the release, natural gas for delivery in January on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 1.1 cents, or about 0.41%, to trade at $2.704 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT).
Futures had been declining by 2.4 cents, or 0.88%, at $2.691 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a build of 2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 201 billion from a year earlier and was 27 bcf below the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.626 trillion cubic feet, 5.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 0.7% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.
Natural gas has been under pressure recently amid forecasts for less heating demand through late December. Earlier on Thursday, it marked its lowest price level of the year, $2.655, since February 28 when it hit $2.653. 
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption."

Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent as reported last month. They dipped 0.1 percent in September.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to to 53.0 in December, from the prior reading of 54.5.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
By sectors, the research group said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) unexpectedly decreased to 52.4 in December, from the prior month’s reading of 54.5.
Analysts had expected the reading to rise to 54.6.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
To the contrary, IHS Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.0 in December from the prior month’s final reading of 53.9.
Economists had estimated that it would rise to just 54.2.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the data was a “mixed bag of news”.
“While manufacturing is ending 2017 with the wind it its sails, the service sector is struggling in the doldrums by comparison,” he said.
According to his calculations, the readings suggested GDP growth of about 2% in the fourth quarter.
“With services representing a far greater portion of the economy than manufacturing, the overall picture is therefore one of the manufacturing sector’s exuberance being overshadowed by the gloomier service sector,” Williamson explained.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1799 from around 1.1807 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was unchanged at 1.3410, while USD/JPY also remained at 112.66.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 93.61 compared to 93.59 before the report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in November as the holiday shopping season got off to a brisk start, pointing to sustained strength in the economy that could pave the way for further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes next year.
The economic outlook was also bolstered by other data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropping to near a 44-1/2-year low last week.
The Fed offered a rosy assessment of the economy in its latest policy statement on Wednesday, describing activity as ""rising at a solid rate."" The U.S. central bank raised borrowing costs for a third time this year and forecast three rate increases for 2018.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, with households buying a range of goods even as they cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. Data for October was revised to show sales gaining 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent increase. 
Retail sales accelerated 5.8 percent on an annual basis. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing only 0.3 percent in November. 
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies after the release of the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher.
Last month, sales at gardening and building material stores jumped 1.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in October. That helped to offset a 0.2 percent drop in receipts at auto dealerships. 
Retail sales were also lifted by a 2.8 percent gain in sales at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month after climbing 0.4 percent in October. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING
Last month's increase in core retail sales suggested a strong pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by steady wage gains as the labor market tightens.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 for the week ended Dec. 9. That was the lowest reading since mid-October when claims dropped to 223,000, a level not seen since March 1973.
Last week marked the 145th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters on Wednesday that the central bank expected the ""labor market to remain strong, with sustained job creation, ample opportunities for workers, and rising wages."" The economy added 228,000 jobs in November. 
Consumer spending increased at a 2.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, contributing to the economy's 3.3 percent growth pace during that period. 
Spending could get a lift from the Trump administration's plan to lower income taxes. But with the bulk of the tax relief expected to go to high-income households, economists caution that the boost might be limited. 
Last month, sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 2.1 percent. Receipts at clothing stores rose 0.7 percent in November. Retailers, including Macy's Inc, (N:M) reported strong sales for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving and the traditional start of the holiday retail season. 

Sales at online retailers soared 2.5 percent last month. Receipts at restaurants and bars gained 0.7 percent and sales at sporting goods and hobby stores shot up 0.9 percent.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 09:24AM ET</span>",ECB hikes growth forecasts but keeps easy money pledge,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised growth and inflation forecasts for the euro area on Thursday but stuck to its pledge to provide stimulus for as long as needed, predicting inflation would remain below target into 2020.
The ECB kept its key rates on hold and also held rigidly to its script on its intentions for next year - despite pressure from some policymakers to acknowledge explicitly the strength of the euro zone recovery and more closely follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's tightening trend.
The euro rose to a day high of $1.186 after the bank raised its growth forecasts from this year through to 2019. Inflation, however, was predicted at just 1.7 percent in 2020 - short of its official target of close to 2 percent - despite a modest upgrade of price expectations.
""All in all the revision of the macroeconomic projections is going in the right direction,"" ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference, noting that subdued wage growth suggested an ""ample"" degree of stimulus was still required.
In a nuanced message, he nonetheless added that he was more confident than two months ago that the inflation target could be reached and said he saw no negative effect from the U.S. Fed's tightening, with its latest rate hike announced on Wednesday.
Six weeks after agreeing to halve asset buys from January, the ECB reiterated its commitment to continue bond purchases at least until the end of September, and to keep reinvesting cash from maturing debt until much later to support a rebound in growth and inflation.
Having faced five years of anemic inflation, the ECB has deployed its entire policy arsenal, cutting rates into negative territory, giving banks cheap loans and hoovering up bonds with an unprecedented 2.55 trillion euros ($3 trillion) of purchases.
Its work has paid off as the euro zone recovery is now well into its fifth year thanks to nine million new jobs, letting policymakers curb stimulus from next year and raising the prospect that the lavish bond buys it started in early 2015 could finally end.
But the economic run is stronger than most have expected. 
Indeed, the euro zone purchasing managers' index rose to a seven-year high this month, data on Thursday showed, while Germany's Ifo institute unveiled surprisingly bullish forecast for the euro zone's biggest economy.
This rapid expansion is fuelling arguments among more conservative policymakers that the ECB is moving too slowly and should be more decisive in signaling the end quantitative easing to preserve its remaining firepower after the crisis tested its limits. 
Shifting the ECB's message on stimulus may have been made easier by a benign market reaction to the Federal Reserve's third, well-telegraphed interest rate hike this year late on Wednesday. [MKTS/GLOB]
This was a sign that investors were confident enough in the state of the global economy not to fear a continued, albeit very gradual, increase in the cost of borrowing dollars - the currency that underpins much of world trade.
Policy hawks in Frankfurt want Draghi to keep preparing markets for an end to asset buys sometime next year, arguing for changes in the bank's message to set up a formal decision by mid-year on ending the bond purchase scheme.
But Draghi said there was no discussion either of a formal end date for the asset purchases or cutting the direct link between inflation and bond purchases, something advocated by several influential policymakers in recent months.
They argued that the ECB should instead connect its overall policy stance to inflation, de facto cutting the emphasis on quantitative easing (QE) and making it easier to end it. 
Some policymakers argue that the ECB should increase the proportion of private sector purchases by keeping those volumes steady when sovereign purchases are cut from January. 

Such a shift could also take some pressure off sovereign buys as the ECB is nearing its self-imposed purchase limits in several countries.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 07:59AM ET</span>",Bank of England: disorderly Brexit risk reduced by EU talks progress,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Last week's breakthrough in Brexit talks has reduced the risk of a disorderly British departure from the European Union and may boost economic confidence, the Bank of England said on Thursday after it left interest rates unchanged.
BoE policymakers voted unanimously to keep rates at 0.5 percent, as expected, a month after raising them for the first time in more than a decade as inflation approached its highest level in nearly six years.
Sterling fell against the dollar  and 10-year British government bond yields (GB10YT=RR) touched a three-month low, however, as markets got no sense that the BoE would speed up its rate hike plans. 
Domestic data suggested the economy might be slowing slightly into the end of the year, and Brexit remained a big uncertainty going forward, the central bank said.
But it drew positive conclusions from finance minister Philip Hammond's annual budget in November - which it said would boost growth slightly over the next few years - as well as from developments in Brexit talks. 
Prime Minister Theresa May secured agreement from the European Commission last week that Britain had made sufficient progress in preliminary talks to move on to negotiating a transition agreement and a longer-term trade deal.
""This would reduce the likelihood of a disorderly exit, and was likely to support household and corporate confidence,"" the BoE said, adding that it would consider progress on Brexit more closely when it updates its forecasts in February.
May is in Brussels on Thursday to get EU national governments to sign off on last week's deal.
BoE Governor Mark Carney has previously faced criticism from Brexit supporters for focusing on the risks of leaving the EU.
GRADUAL RATE RISES
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee stuck to its view from last month that interest rates were only likely to need to rise gradually.
""The committee remained of the view that, were the economy to follow the path expected in the November Inflation Report, further modest increases in Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years,"" the BoE said.
The BoE decision comes the day after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a third time this year, and shortly before the European Central Bank was due to make a statement on monetary policy.
""We expect that the MPC will raise interest rates again next year but there were no hints today as to when that will occur. We think August 2018 is the most likely date for the next hike,"" said Rhys Herbert, a senior economist at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected a 9-0 vote in favor of leaving policy unchanged from the Monetary Policy Committee after last month's rate rise. The BoE said this marked the start of a very gradual tightening cycle as the economy comes close to running at full capacity.
Inflation hit its highest level in nearly six years in November at 3.1 percent, and the jobless rate remains at the lowest since 1975, even though the outlook for growth is soft.
Last month the BoE said it expected the economy to grow by 1.6 percent next year, unchanged from what it expects for 2017 and somewhat faster than the government and most economists polled by Reuters expect.
Both financial markets and economists mostly expect the BoE to wait nearly a year before raising interest rates again.
Figures overnight pointed to the weakest housing market since 2013 but retail sales data earlier on Thursday were unexpectedly strong, as shoppers pounced on Black Friday bargains.
The BoE said inflation was now near its peak and reiterated its view that above-target price growth was almost all due to sterling's fall after June 2016's Brexit vote. It expects inflation to fall slowly next year.
Wage growth - which many BoE policymakers view as a good guide to medium-term inflation pressures - remains slow, with regular pay in the three months to October up just 2.3 percent on a year earlier. 

However, the BoE said this was in line with expectations, unlike in previous years when it had disappointed, and that slack in the economy was being steadily eroded.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank nudged money market interest rates upward on Thursday just hours after the Federal Reserve raised the U.S. benchmark, as Beijing seeks to prevent destabilizing capital outflows without hurting economic growth.
Economists were surprised by the move but said at just five basis points, the increases were small and more symbolic than substantive.
The People's Bank of China called it a ""normal market reaction"" to the Fed that would keep interest rate expectations reasonable and help with the deleveraging campaign.
China's major stock indexes declined modestly after the news, with infrastructure, IT and financial shares down.
The PBOC increased rates on reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, used for open market operations by 5 basis points for the 7-day and 28-day tenors.
It also said in a statement it increased rates on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) also by 5 basis points.
Thursday's move was the first time the Chinese central bank has raised rates since March, but market interest rates have risen on their own during the interim as the government pursues a range of policies to lower leverage and debt in the economy.
Chen Ji, an analyst at Bank of Communications, said the rate increase was unexpected but too small to have much meaningful impact, and represented only a response to the Fed's rate hike.
""(It) doesn't really impact borrowing costs, and fluctuations of this level are very normal in the interbank market,"" he said, adding that he thought China's economy was not robust enough to handle a benchmark rate increase.
Ken Cheung, senior Asian forex strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd in Hong Kong, also said the rise was surprising, and characterized the five basis point magnitude as ""mild"".
""This suggests that the PBOC's intention to balance the risk of over-tightening amid the deleveraging process,"" Cheung wrote in a note.
Benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates have remained unchanged since October 2015, but the PBOC has increasingly relied on market rates to guide the economy.
""The move also aims to shrink the gap between short-term and long-term rates to curb (financial institutions) from using short-term loans to invest long-term debt by overly adding leverage,"" Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
Nie added that a ""too aggressive"" rate hike would have ""too much"" impact to real economy.
For details of the rates that were raised on Thursday, click on:
The PBOC has moved to a tightening bias this year following six benchmark interest rate cuts in 2014-2015 as the economy stabilizes and the focus turns toward credit risk.
In a statement accompanying the rate increases, the PBOC said on Thursday the upward adjustment reflected supply and demand in the market, and was a ""normal market reaction"" to Fed's rate increase.
It said the adjustment would help shape ""reasonable"" interest rate expectations.
At the same time, the rate hike would help prevent financial institutions from over-leveraging while helping control the overall macro leverage ratio.

As market rates have risen this year, the differential with official rates has widened. On Thursday, the volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo  traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.8412 percent.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 06:49AM ET</span>","China raises market rates to fend off financial risks, growth cools","By Kevin Yao and Winni Zhou
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank on Thursday nudged up money market rates as authorities sought to defuse financial risks without imperilling the economy, a balancing act that they have managed successfully so far this year as activity remained broadly steady. 
The world's second-biggest economy has started to cool in recent months amid a government crackdown on high-risk lending and polluting factories, and the move by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) - coming hours after an anticipated U.S. Federal Reverse rate hike - signaled that Beijing will keep policy tighter next year.
A flurry of data on the day highlighted the economic impact of government efforts to wean China off its years-long addiction to debt, with industrial output, investment and property market all backing evidence of a moderation in momentum.
Analysts said the PBOC rate hikes, widely seen as a backdoor approach that avoids the need to raise benchmark policy rates, will not impede activity though they signaled a commitment by authorities to continue curbing leverage. 
""It's more a symbolic move which helps stabilize market expectations after the Fed rate hike,"" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing. 
He noted that the gap between 10-year U.S. and Chinese bond yields has widened to 160 basis points so the 5 bps rise will not put any pressure on the yuan, which slumped in 2016 before recovering this year after authorities slapped a range of capital control measures.
""They want to narrow the gap between operating interest rates and market interest rates for financial institutions, otherwise it could give financial institutions the wrong impression and lead to arbitrage and an increase in leverage."" 
The PBOC increased rates on reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, used for open market operations by 5 basis points for the 7-day and 28-day tenors. It increased rates on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) also by 5 basis points.
Also on Thursday, the PBOC raised interest rates on its standing lending facility (SLF) short-term loans by 5 basis points, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A trader at an asset management firm in Shanghai said that the yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds (CN10YT=RR) fell 2-3 basis points after the PBOC's announcement, as some had expected a bigger move. However, he expects the broader trend of higher yields will continue amid the ongoing campaign to reduce financial risk.
It was the first rate increase by the Chinese central bank since March, but market interest rates have risen on their own in the interim as the government pursued a range of policies to lower debt in the economy.
That has dragged on activity, a fact underscored by Thursday's National Bureau of Statistics data releases which showed industrial output was up 6.1 percent in November year-on-year, versus forecasts for an increase of 6.0 percent, but below the 6.2 percent gain in October. 
China's fixed-asset investment growth also slowed to 7.2 percent in the January-November period, from the 7.3 percent expansion in the January-October months. 
Along with the rest of trade-dependent Asia, China's economy gained a lift this year from an exports boom, while a government-led infrastructure spending spree and a resilient property market drove growth in the Asian giant to a surprisingly strong 6.9 percent in the nine months of the year. 
SLOWDOWN
Growth has been cooling in recently, however, hurt by higher borrowing costs while tighter rules on polluting factories have crimped production. 
As northern China officially entered the heating season in mid-November, the government has also stepped up efforts to address winter smog, ordering many steel mills, smelters and factories to curtail or halt production. 
The curbs saw China's daily crude steel output slide in November to the lowest in nine months
""Economic operations are generally steady and economic growth is more resilient... so this provides a good time window for stepping up structural reforms, including pollution controls,"" statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong told reporters following a regular press conference on Thursday. 
The construction boom has driven up demand for everything from cement to steel and lifted prices of commodities. A red-hot property market has also been a major growth driver of China's economy this year, but a slowdown is expected as more cities unveil measures to curb soaring home prices and banks raise mortgage rates in response to tighter policy.
New construction starts measured by floor area accelerated 6.9 percent in January-November, though property investment slowed to 7.5 percent on-year in that period, from a 7.8 percent gain in the first 10 months of 2017.
ON TARGET
Thursday's data also showed growth of private investment slowed a touch to 5.7 percent in January-November. 
Retail sales gained 10.2 percent in November on-year, just above the prior month, likely boosted by China's annual 24-hour shopping binge on Nov. 11, known as Singles' Day, when sales hit $38.25 billion - exceeding combined revenue for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States.
Taken together, the data suggest economic growth is still expected to easily meet or beat the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent and signaled that China has sufficient headroom to keep policy tight over the next year.
""The adjustment of China's money market rate hike will continue to remind investors that financial de-leverage is a long haul project for China,"" OCBC economist Tommy Xie wrote in a note.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 05:19AM ET</span>",UK retailers enjoy bumper Black Friday sales,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers pounced on electrical goods and other Black Friday bargains last month, giving an unexpectedly big boost to retail sales, which contrasted with earlier signs of a subdued start to Christmas spending.
Consumers have been squeezed through most of this year by rising inflation which hit its highest in nearly six years last month, at a time when wages are failing to keep up.
But there was some unexpected cheer for retailers in November data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed sales volumes were 1.6 percent higher than a year ago, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Spending in cash terms was 4.7 percent higher.
The market reaction was muted and some economists said the surge in retail sales might reflect Christmas spending being brought forward to take advantage of Black Friday discounts.
""The boost from Black Friday will be fleeting,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The figures may provide some reassurance to the Bank of England, which raised interest rates for the first time in over a decade last month and will publish its latest rate decision at 1200 GMT.
Kallum Pickering, an economist with Berenberg Bank, said the figures added to signs from factories that Britain's economy was picking up a bit of speed in late 2017 and he expected that momentum to continue into 2018. 
""The risk from inflation to real spending growth has been exaggerated. Households will simply borrow a little more and save a little less to smooth out their consumption,"" he said.
On the month, overall retail sales were 1.1 percent higher, up from growth of 0.5 percent in October and much stronger than economists' forecasts of a 0.4 percent rise.
Household goods stores specifically reported that Black Friday promotions had boosted sales, the ONS said, with the amount of electrical household appliances sold jumping by nearly 9 percent compared with October.
The data are seasonally adjusted, but the agency said this may not fully strip out the effect of Black Friday, as the promotion period - a relatively recent phenomenon borrowed from the United States - has increased in Britain in recent years.
Looking at the past three months as a whole, which smoothes out monthly volatility, the picture is gloomier. Sales in the three months to November grew by just 1.0 percent compared with a year earlier, the weakest since May 2013.
When the BoE raised interest rates on Nov. 2, it forecast real-terms household consumption growth would slow to 1 percent next year from 1.5 percent predicted for this year as demand shifted towards business investment and exports. 
Official data earlier this week showed that consumer price inflation rose to its highest in nearly six years at 3.1 percent in November, while the number of people in work fell for a second consecutive month.
Food prices are rising at their fastest rate in four years, adding to the squeeze on household budgets. The ONS data showed the volume of food purchased was 0.1 percent lower than a year before, while spending on food was up by 3.5 percent.
This week British electronics retailer Dixons Carphone (L:DC) said it had enjoyed record sales during November's Black Friday promotion, despite weak demand for mobile phones that hit profits. 
But home furnishings company  Carpetright  (L:CPRC) cut forecasts after warning of fragile consumer confidence. 

The British Retail Consortium said last week its members had seen subdued sales last month and credit card company Visa reported the first year-on-year fall in inflation-adjusted spending in five years as Britons cut back on big purchases.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary manufacturing index (PMI) jumped to 59.3 in December from 57.7 the month before, blowing past expectations of economists polled by Reuters and hitting a more than 17-year high.
The reading for the dominant service sector edged down to 59.4 this month from 60.4 in December, slightly below expectations, but still far above the 50-point threshold separating expansions in activity from contractions.
That gave an overall composite index of 60.0 points, a touch below the 60.3 recorded in November but above the 59.4 forecast by economists and only the second time since May 2011 that the index reached the 60 mark.
""France is very much leading the pack in the fourth quarter in terms of overall growth rates,"" IHS Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said, adding that the reading was consistent with economic growth of 0.7-0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
""The fact the French economy has shaken off its malaise, picking up growth momentum almost continually throughout the year to end on this super strong high note is a key factor into why the euro zone is doing so well,"" he said.
Businesses saw a further rise in new orders, with demand coming from both the domestic market and foreign clients, and created new jobs for the 14th month in a row to help go through accumulating backlog and an increase in unfinished work.
The situation at the end of 2017 was in stark contrast with the stagnation or slight contraction the PMI data described only a year and a half ago.
""It's a really strong growth story that nobody really foresaw earlier in the year,"" Williamson said.
Rock-bottom interest rates brought about by the ECB's bond-buying program, a pick-up in growth among France's main trading partners and tax cuts for companies have helped pull the French economy out of its rut.
The election of pro-business President Emmanuel Macron in May, who wasted no time in passing a wide-ranging reform of labor market rules, also pushed business and consumer confidence to multi-year highs.
""It just goes to show how a bit of political confidence aligned with all the economic stimulus has just turned the French economy around,"" Williamson said.

Banco de Mexico is expected to hike its key rate <MXCBIR=ECI> by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent, the highest in nearly nine years, according to 17 of the 31 economists polled by Reuters this week.
The remaining 14 analysts saw the bank holding the rate steady at its current 7.0 percent for the fourth straight monetary policy meeting.
Mexican annual inflation accelerated to 6.63 percent in November, the steepest rate since August when it hit the highest level in 16 years.
Thursday's announcement will mark the first policy meeting presided over by new Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon following the departure of Agustin Carstens to the Bank for International Settlements at the end of November.
Many analysts expect Diaz de Leon will want to burnish his inflation-fighting credentials since his previous position at the finance ministry leaves him exposed to criticism that he may favor lower rates to foster growth and keep government financing costs down.
On the day of his nomination late last month, Diaz de Leon said the inflation outlook had deteriorated and warned that a drop in the rate toward the central bank's 3 percent target next year may not pan out as forecast due to possible shocks in the future.
Further backing expectations for a hike, the Fed on Wednesday raised its key rate.
Higher U.S. interest rates can sap demand for emerging market assets, and Mexican policymakers will likely want to push up yields on Mexican debt in order to underpin the peso, which has been hit by concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The central bank will publish the rate decision at 1 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Thursday.

""With Q3 GDP growth recently revised higher, latest flash PMI data signalled further positivity for the Japanese economy in the final month of 2017,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Hayes noted that the PMI was supported by the sharpest boost in order book volumes since January 2014.
""Recent yen weakness appeared to benefit exporters, with new orders from abroad rising strongly,"" he said.
The flash index for new orders rose to 56.6 in December, from a final 54.7 in the previous month.
The output price index increased to 51.4, the highest since July 2014, from a final 51.3 in November.
The final December reading is due on Jan. 4. 
Japan's economy grew twice as fast as originally estimated in the third quarter, thanks to a business spending splurge and buoyant exports that compensated for a decline in consumer spending, the government said last week.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK RICS house price balance slips to lowest since March 2013,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices were flat for the first time in more than four years during the past three months, a closely watched industry survey showed on Thursday, as falling prices in London and nearby areas dragged down the national average.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its monthly house price balance fell to zero in November from +1 the month before, meaning its members were evenly split between those reporting price rises compared with three months ago and those seeing falls.
This was the lowest level for RICS's price balance since March 2013, and in line with the average forecast for a decline in a Reuters poll, as tax changes and concerns about Brexit dented demand in central London in particular.
RICS members expect prices to fall over the next three months - though less sharply than they thought a couple of months ago - and now expect prices to rise over the next year. 
""The mood music in London and the South East is very much flatter than elsewhere and interestingly, the forward looking indicators suggest this is likely to persist into the new year,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Prices in eastern and northeast England also fell, but there were solid gains in Wales, Northern Ireland and northwest England, RICS said.
Official data for the year to October, released on Tuesday, painted a similar picture. Prices for the United Kingdom as a whole were 4.5 percent higher, while London was up 2.1 percent.
London's housing market is the most exposed to foreign investors' concerns about Brexit, as well as to tax increases for property purchases valued at over 1 million pounds ($1.34 million).
Last month the government scrapped property purchase tax for most first-time buyers as the flagship measure of its annual budget in a bid to tackle falling home ownership among young people who find it increasingly hard to buy their own home.
RICS said its members had seen little sign of increased interest from buyers in the weeks since the change.
The body also reported the biggest fall on record in demand from tenants to rent property - though it said this was likely to be partly a seasonal effect in the run-up to Christmas.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",Bank of England's Brexit views in focus as rates set to stay on hold,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England's views on Brexit will be scrutinized by investors on Thursday when the central bank announces its first policy decision since raising rates for the first time in more than a decade last month.
Both financial markets and economists expect BoE officials will wait nearly a year before raising interest rates again - a much slower pace of tightening than the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The ""very gradual"" pace of tightening signaled by the BoE last month reflects both uncertainty about the economic impact of ongoing talks to leave the European Union, as well as weak underlying inflation pressures that belie a headline rate at its highest in nearly six years.
Last week's judgment by the European Commission that Britain had made sufficient progress in Brexit talks to move on to negotiations over trade and an interim deal to cover the period until 2021 should reinforce the BoE's assumption that the Brexit process will be smooth.
""We expect a 'holding position' from the BoE ... and a neutral tone on Brexit progress,"" said Robert Wood, UK economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Like most economists polled by Reuters, he expects the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee to vote 9-0 to keep rates at 0.5 percent, after a 7-2 split in favor of raising rates by a quarter of a percentage point last month.
BoE Governor Mark Carney has said the central bank will focus on consumers' and businesses' reaction to Brexit talks, rather than make its own judgment about the economic impact.
Wood said he did not think last week's Brexit progress - which had been in some doubt - would make the BoE raise rates sooner in 2018. 
Consumer demand has faltered this year mostly due to rising inflation - not Brexit worries - so last week's agreement removed a downside risk, rather than pointing to stronger growth. Figures overnight pointed to the weakest housing market since 2013.
Last month the BoE maintained its forecast that the economy would grow 1.6 percent next year - slightly faster than expected by the government and most economists polled by Reuters.
Since then, inflation has risen to its highest since March 2012 at 3.1 percent. The BoE says this overshoot is almost all due to sterling's fall after June 2016's Brexit vote, and it expects inflation to fall slowly next year.
Wage growth - which many BoE policymakers view as a good guide to medium-term inflation pressures - remains slow, with regular pay in the three months to October up just 2.3 percent on a year earlier.
However Wolfgang Bauer, a fixed income fund manager at M&G Investments, said Brexit made the BoE the hardest major central bank to predict for next year based on economics alone.
""If there are some hiccups in the negotiation process - and I think that is very likely - we could see some pressure on sterling,"" he said. 

""That ... might make the Bank of England want to have a bit more of a tighter monetary policy. On the other hand, if there's a less-than-ideal Brexit on the horizon, that might dampen economic growth.""

In a move largely expected by financial markets, members of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) agreed to raise its benchmark rate target by 0.25% to 1.25%-1.5%, and maintained its forecast for additional rate hikes in 2018.
The ""dot plot,"" part of the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, indicated that the central bank saw rates rising to between 2% and 2.25% by the end of the 2018, despite concerns over inflation.
With rates raised on Wednesday raised to 1.25-5%, that points to three quarter-point rate increases in 2018.
“On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2%,” the FOMC statement noted. “Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.”
In a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy, the rate-setting committee revised upwards its projection for economic growth in 2017 to 2.5%, a 0.1% increase from the previous projection of 2.4% in September, while growth in 2018 was seen at 2.5%, a 0.4% increase from its previous estimate.
Recent inflationary pressures, however, encouraged the Fed to revise upwards its median projection for inflation to 1.7% by the end of this year, up from the 1.6% previously forecast, while the median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were unchanged at 1.9% and 2%, respectively.
Data released earlier Wednesday showed that, on a year-over-year basis, the core version of consumer price inflation, undershot expectations rising just 1.7% in November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer inflation slowed in November, held down by weak healthcare costs and the biggest drop in apparel prices in nearly two decades, which could impact the pace at which the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year.
Inflation has moderated for much of this year, leading to concern among some Fed officials that the factors holding back price pressures could prove more persistent. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.
The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year, encouraged by a tightening labor market and strengthening economy. It has forecast three rate hikes next year.
""The lack of a sustained pickup in core CPI does make the Fed deliberations about the pace of monetary policy tightening next year more complicated,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. macro investor services at Oxford Economics in New York.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index excluding the volatile food and energy components ticked up 0.1 percent also as prices for airline fares and household furnishing fell. The so-called core CPI advanced 0.2 percent in October. 
As a result, the annual increase in the core CPI slowed to 1.7 percent in November from 1.8 percent in October. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target. The central bank's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has consistently undershot its target for almost 5-1/2 years.
The overall CPI increased 0.4 percent in November after edging up 0.1 percent in October. That raised the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 2.0 percent in October.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose marginally on the core CPI data, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
FISCAL STIMULUS
Economists believe inflation will rise next year after Republicans in the U.S. Congress approved plans for sweeping tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to about 20 percent from 35 percent. The fiscal stimulus will come at a time when the economy is almost at full employment.
""This expectation supports our forecast for the Fed to raise its policy rate four times next year after increasing it today,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist for Americas and Asia at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. 
Last month, the cost of healthcare services slipped 0.1 percent, the first drop since May, with prices for doctor visits falling 0.8 percent. In the 12 months through November, the cost of doctor visits tumbled 1.8 percent, the biggest decline since records started in 1947.
Apparel prices dropped 1.3 percent, the largest fall since September 1998, after dipping 0.1 percent in October. Economists said an unseasonably warm November probably contributed to the decline in apparel prices, as well as competition from online retailers like Amazon (O:AMZN). 
""It was one of the warmest Novembers on record, which means that people would have bought proportionally less full-price winter clothing and more discounted summer/fall clothing,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""If we're right, clothing prices will snap back in December.""
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence gained 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in October. Gasoline prices rebounded 7.3 percent after falling 2.4 percent in October. 

Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent after two straight monthly declines. There were also increases in prices of alcohol, mobile phone services and tobacco.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices rose 0.4% in November from a month earlier, in line with forecasts and compared a 0.1% gain in the previous month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.2% last month, matching expectations and strengthening from the 2.0% advance seen in October.
Furthermore, core CPI also dropped to an annualized rate of 1.7% in November, missing forecasts that it would repeat the prior month’s reading of a 1.8% rise.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Despite the data, the U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise the Fed funds target range by a quarter point at 2:00PM ET (19:00GMT) Wednesday as it moves forward with plans to gradually tighten policy.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, Fed fund futures fully price in the increase to a range between 1.25%-1.50%.
Therefore, markets will play close to attention to Fed chair Janet Yellen’s press conference 30 minutes after the release of the policy statement, as investors look for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy in the months ahead.
Furthermore, along with its latest forecasts for economic growth, the Fed will also release its projections for interest rates, known as the ""dot-plot"". Last time, the Fed had forecast three rate rises for next year and is expected to keep its outlook about the same even though the market has been skeptical it will hike as much as it foresees.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A boom in newly built luxury apartments in Manhattan has skewed prices for the overall residential real estate market in the borough and masked a sharp drop in transaction volume over the past five years, a property report on Wednesday showed.
The number of apartment sales priced above $10 million has doubled since 2013 when the post-crisis recovery was fully in swing, CityRealty's 2017 Year-End Manhattan Market Report said. 
The number of units that sold for less than $1 million plunged by 35 percent over that period, the report said.
The super wealthy have tilted condo prices in Manhattan, marking a dramatic change from the pre-crisis building boom, said Gabby Warshawer, director of research at the CityRealty real estate listings and data website.
During the mid-2000s, developers constructed a record number of new condo units in Manhattan but prices were generally not higher than the average for existing condos, she said.
In the past five years, however, Manhattan has seen a different kind of development boom. Prices for these units are higher than they ever were before but the number of units built and sold is way off levels achieved a decade ago, Warshawer said.  
""As prices have risen, less of the market share is comprised of cheaper units,"" she said.
In 2013, 7,787 units were sold for under $1 million for a total $4.7 billion in sales. This year is projected to end with 5,040 units sold at under $1 million for $3.4 billion in sales.
Units sold at 432 Park Avenue, a 96-story tower marketed by developers as the tallest residential building in the Americas, garnered the most number of sales in a listing of the 25 highest-priced condos, CityRealty said.
The two highest priced sales were also at 432 Park Avenue for $65.7 million and $65.2 million, respectively.
The median sales price of high-end apartments edged higher in 2017, but the closely watched average square-foot price slid a bit for condos as prices leveled off after years of heady growth, the report said. 
While the average and median sales price for all residential units has jumped since 2007 by 61 percent to $2.2 million and 44 percent to $1.2 million, respectively, transaction volume is off 30 percent from peak activity a decade ago, CityRealty said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese machinery orders bounced back in October with a faster increase than expected, re-affirming the resilience of capital spending - a key driver in the economy's near two-year expansion.
Core machinery orders, a volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, climbed 5.0 percent in October from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said on Wednesday.
The gain in core orders, which exclude those of ships and power generation equipment, beat economists' median estimate of a 3.0 percent increase. Orders fell 8.1 percent in September, the steepest drop in more than two years.
Capital spending - investment in factories and equipment - was a big contributor to the economy's seventh straight quarter of growth in the July-September period, the longest streak on record in data going back to 1994, making up for a rare decline in consumer spending.
In the longer term, the government is urging companies to increase capital spending to improve productivity in response to a shrinking labor force as the population declines.
""Machinery orders from manufacturers were especially strong in October,"" said Daiju Aoki, UBS Securities regional chief investment officer for Japan.
""In the fourth quarter, the manufacturing sector is very solid. I think that exporters are benefiting from demand from China, and there's demand because of the labor shortage,"" he said.
Orders from manufacturers rose 7.4 percent in October, led by chemical makers and electronics manufacturers.
A Cabinet Office official said demand for machinery to make semiconductors and smartphone-related parts was picking up as the economies of China and other Asia countries recovered.
But non-manufacturers' orders rose a more muted 1.1 percent, after an 11.1 percent slide in September. They were supported by demand from shipping and postal firms.
UBS's Aoki said he was concerned about the non-manufacturing sector as consumer sentiment had been hurt in part by higher food prices, which shoppers are reluctant to accept at a time of slow wage growth.
""So fourth-quarter machinery orders, from these numbers, could be close to flat compared with the third quarter,"" he cautioned.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders increased 2.3 percent versus economists' expectations of a 2.8 percent fall.
The government maintained its assessment that machinery orders were showing signs of picking up.

That compared with a budget deficit of $137 billion in the same month last year, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury recording a $134 billion deficit last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was also $139 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $137 billion in the same month in the previous year.
The deficit for the fiscal year to date was $202 billion, compared to a deficit of $183 billion in the comparable period for fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, the fiscal year-to-date deficit was $248 billion last month versus $222 billion in the prior year.
Receipts last month totaled $208 billion, up 4 percent from one year ago, while outlays were $347 billion, a 3 percent increase from the same month a year earlier.
Last week, Congress approved a short-term funding bill that will keep the government open until Dec. 23 but it has yet to agree on a longer-term budget.
The Treasury Department has a statutory cap on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. It has been bumping up against that cap and only Congress can raise the limit.
A temporary measure that suspended the debt limit expired on Dec. 8, although the Treasury has emergency means to continue to pay all its bills through January, it has said.

At the same time, Republicans, who control Congress, are nearing approval of an overhaul of the tax system. Their legislation would add $1.4 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt to finance changes that they say would further boost an already growing economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in November as gasoline prices surged and the cost of other goods increased, leading to the largest annual gain in nearly six years.
The fairly strong report from the Labor Department on Tuesday suggested a broad acceleration in wholesale price pressures, which could assuage concerns among some Federal Reserve officials over persistently low inflation.
""This demand-led price push from higher commodity prices is a classic early warning signal that consumer goods will also see increasing inflationary pressures,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, advancing by the same margin for three straight months. In the 12 months through November, the PPI shot up 3.1 percent. That was the biggest gain since January 2012 and followed a 2.8 percent rise in October.
Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.3 percent last month and increasing 2.9 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services also rose 0.4 percent last month. The so-called core PPI had increased by 0.2 percent for two straight months. It rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months through November, the largest gain since the series started in August 2014, after increasing 2.3 percent in October.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stock index futures were trading mostly higher.
The broad rise in producer prices supports views that weak inflation readings experienced through the first half of the year probably were temporary. Some Fed officials worry that the factors that held down inflation early in the year could become more persistent.
The Fed officials were due to gather for a two-day policy meeting starting later on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday, for a third time this year, with a robust labor market and strengthening economy expected to overshadow policymakers' earlier concerns about tame inflation.
INFLATION MOVING UP
The central bank tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, which has undershot the Fed's 2 percent target for nearly 5-1/2 years.
""The pickup over the year will be welcomed by the Fed as an indication that inflation is gradually moving up,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Inflation data on Wednesday is expected to show the consumer price index rising 0.4 percent in November after nudging up 0.1 percent in October, according to a Reuters survey. The core CPI is seen rising 0.2 percent for a second straight month.
Last month, gasoline prices surged 15.8 percent, the biggest gain since August 2009, after dropping 4.6 percent in October. Gasoline accounted for two thirds of the 1.0 percent increase in the final demand goods index. 
There were also increases in the prices of light motor trucks, pharmaceutical preparations, beef, residential electricity and jet fuel.
Wholesale food prices rose 0.3 percent in November after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Prices for services gained 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. 
Core goods climbed 0.3 percent in November, rising by the same margin for a third consecutive month. Prices for passenger cars accelerated 0.5 percent last month, the largest increase since December 2016, after being unchanged in October.

The cost of healthcare services was unchanged last month after rising 0.3 percent in October. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred core PCE price index.

Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 2.4% last month, above forecasts for a 2.3% increase and at the same rate as October.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.

“Falling prices in the miscellaneous goods and services category (covering products such as travel goods and financial services) provided the largest offsetting downward contribution,” it added.
The increase means the Bank of England governor Mark Carney will have to write a letter to chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why inflation is racing over the BoE’s 2% target. Of note, annual inflation is putting pressure on British households as wage inflation remains at a lower 2.1%.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.3% in November, compared to consensus expectations for a 0.2% advance and the 0.1% gain registered in the previous month.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.7% last month, matching, as expected, October’s increase.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 3.9% on an annualized basis in November, compared to previous month’s 4.0% rise. Analysts had expected inflation to increase to 4.1%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by just 0.2% in November, slightly higher than the 0.1% rise seen a month earlier but below the forecast for a 0.3% gain.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 4.5% in November, below forecasts for a gain of 5.2% and following a 4.8% increase a month earlier. October’s data was revised down from an initial 5.4% rise.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3370 from around 1.3362 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8811 from 0.8816 earlier while GBP/JPY changed hands at 151.64, compared to 151.53 previously.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded mostly higher. London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.11%, the Euro Stoxx 50 rose 0.25%, France's CAC 40 traded up 0.27%, while Germany's DAX advanced 0.12%."
980,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 02:40AM ET</span>",Myanmar's business confidence plummets as policy uncertainty bites: survey,"YANGON (Reuters) - Business confidence among entrepreneurs in Myanmar dropped ""drastically"" this year due to unclear economic policy, a survey shows on Tuesday, amid growing frustration over leader Aung San Suu Kyi's management of the fledgling economy. 
Suu Kyi has identified economic reform as a key goal to complete Myanmar's democratic transition after decades of isolation under military rule, but the sluggish pace of change has disappointed many in one of the region's poorest countries.
Investors are also wary that Myanmar may face reinstatement of some sanctions over its treatment of its Rohingya minority, further threatening Suu Kyi's promise of a reformist government that would attract much-needed foreign investment. 
Myanmar's short-term business confidence dropped to 49 percent in 2017 from 73 percent a year ago, according to a survey by consultancy Roland Berger and the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
The study, which reflects views of about 500 local and international business owners in Myanmar, said the ""lack of a clear economic policy and plan"" is to blame for the drop. 
""What the private sector seems to be looking for are much more specific plans, endorsed by the government,"" said Thomas Klotz, managing partner of Roland Berger in Southeast Asia.
""What is missing so far is the communication of an overall economic transformation roadmap, with clear targets, timeline and quick wins.""
The survey was conducted earlier this year before the latest violence in Myanmar's western Rakhine state that the United Nations said was ""ethnic cleansing"", which Klotz said was ""likely to have further reduced investor confidence in Myanmar.""
Other challenges facing companies in Myanmar include lack of trained staff, unpredictable legislative environment and selective law enforcement, the survey showed. 
Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Myanmar will delay a long-awaited corporate reform that would open the door further to foreign investment, dealing a fresh blow to investor confidence in Suu Kyi's administration.
Once one of the strongest economies in Southeast Asia before independence in 1948, Myanmar sank into poverty after decades of central planning and a failed experiment with socialism which involved the nationalization of many of its industries. 
Myanmar's ruling generals ceded power to a semi-civilian government in 2011, which embarked on sweeping economic reforms and slowly began loosening their grip on business, but their associates continue to dominate large parts of the economy. 
The government last year issued a thin economic policy that many said lacked detail or plans for how to accomplish the goals. In April, Myanmar passed a long-delayed investment law, simplifying procedures and giving foreign investors equal treatment to the locals.
Growth in both foreign investment and gross domestic product have slowed since Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy took office last year after years of junta-era rules.
Myanmar recorded monthly average foreign investment of $739 million so far this year, below levels reported in 2015 under the former military-backed government, according to Roland Berger.
The International Monetary Fund had downgraded Myanmar's gross domestic product growth forecast this year to 6.7 percent from 7 percent. 
But Klotz said 88 percent of business owners remained optimistic about Myanmar's long-term outlook thanks to the potential of the market of over 50 million population. 

""'More and faster' will hopefully be the motto for the government's economic agenda in 2018,"" he said.

A combination of high inflation, caused in large part by the 2016 Brexit vote, and weak wage growth means British workers are expected to see their salaries fall in real terms by 0.5 percent next year, according to a survey published by the firm.
The most recent official data has shown British average weekly earnings fell by an annual 0.4 percent in the three months to September when adjusted for inflation.
Globally, inflation-adjusted wages are expected to rise by 1.5 percent next year, Korn Ferry said, the weakest predicted increase in five years, underscoring the challenge for policymakers in many countries where unemployment is low but wage growth is weak.
Benjamin Frost, Korn Ferry's global general manager, said the situation in Britain was aggravated by the jump in inflation which hit 3 percent in October and is expected to stay at that level when data for November is released on Tuesday. 
""What stands out is that employers are not increasing their pay rises to account for that,"" he said. ""They have limited ability to charge their customers more and improvements in productivity are easier said than done in the short term.""
In the United States, workers were expected to see a real-terms salary increase of 1 percent in 2018, based on forecasts of wage increases of 3 percent and inflation of 2 percent.

Korn Ferry said the predicted salary increases were based on its database which contains information from 25,000 organizations across more than 110 countries. In Britain, 770 firms took part.

The survey of consumer expectations, which the Fed eyes among other data as it cautiously raises interest rates, showed the one-year-ahead measure stable at 2.61 percent. The three-year gauge slipped a bit to 2.78 last month, from 2.81 in October. 
Both have edged higher in recent months but they are down for the year and remain near their lowest readings since the survey began in mid-2013. That covers a period in which spot U.S. inflation levels have lingered below a 2-percent Fed target.
Nonetheless, the central bank expects to hike rates again this week in part due to labor market strength. The survey reflected this trend with jumps in both earnings growth and employment expectations in November.
The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 08:10AM ET</span>",Russian central bank seen cutting rate to 8.00 percent on Friday,"By Elena Fabrichnaya and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank is expected to lower its key interest rate to 8 percent on Friday, in what would be the sixth rate cut so far this year, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
All 22 analysts and economists polled said they expected the central bank to lower the key rate by 25 basis points  at its year-end board meeting from the current 8.25 percent.
Yet another rate cut has been priced in by the market as annual consumer inflation has been on the decline for months, hitting a fresh post-Soviet low of 2.5 percent in November, below the central bank's ultimate target of 4 percent.
Shrugging off calls from businesses to cut rates faster, the central bank stuck to its plan for taming inflation, which was stubbornly high at nearly 17 percent less than three years ago.
To keep inflation in check, the central bank enacted a gradual monetary easing pattern, saying it won't hurry with rate cuts given risks that inflation may speed up again.
""We don't anticipate any changes in the careful approach to monetary policy making that the central bank has been systematically pursuing in the last couple of years,"" said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Citi in Moscow.
Higher rates mean borrowing is more expensive but they curb inflation risks. They also slow Russia's recovery after two years of recession caused by a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis. Oil is Russia's largest export.
""We expect the central bank to promote gradual policy easing at its upcoming (monetary policy committee) meeting, i.e. we believe the key rate could be cut a further 25 basis points to 8.0 percent, though with guidance left cautious,"" Rosbank, a Moscow-based subsidiary of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said in a note.
""External conditions favor further policy normalization, though uncertainty about the implementation of sanctions against Russia may keep guidance fairly cautious,"" they said.
The central bank said this month that current rate levels were sufficient to withstand possible shocks if the United States extended economic sanctions against Moscow, including a ban on purchases of Russian OFZ treasury bonds.
Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise rates this week could also prompt the Bank of Russia to be cautious.
A monthly economic poll in late November showed the market expects the central bank to keep on cutting rates next year, bringing the key rate to 7.5 percent in the first half of 2018.
The central bank said last week it would continue gradually reducing its key rate throughout 2018.

It had said it planned to lower the rate to 6.5-7 percent in 2019 after it anchors annual inflation at around 4 percent.

The business survey index (BSI) of sentiment at large manufacturers stood at plus 9.7, up from plus 9.4 in July-September, according to the joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, an arm of the Cabinet Office.
The mood was brightened by a weaker yen and a 12 percent jump in the Nikkei <.225> stock average since the previous survey period, while sales and profits were up led by auto manufacturers and makers of electronic parts for smartphones.
The results come before the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey of corporate sentiment, due on Friday, which is expected to show confidence among big manufacturers at its highest in more than a decade.
The buoyant mood coincides with a record economic expansion: gross domestic product climbed an annualized 2.5 percent in July-September for the seventh straight quarter of growth, the longest rising streak in data going back to 1994. 
A big contributor to growth during the quarter was capital spending.
Monday's survey shows that big manufacturers plan to raise capital spending by 10.7 percent in the current half of the fiscal year ending in March, up from their previous projection of an 8.9 percent increase.

The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to decline.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation slowed to a four-month low in November as factory activity softened due to the government's ongoing efforts to curb pollution, cooling demand from factories for raw materials.
Producer prices rose 5.8 percent from a year earlier - the lowest since July, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday. The rise was slightly less than market expectations and compared with the previous month's 6.9 percent increase.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the PPI in November would rise an annual 5.9 percent, easing back also because of a high base a year earlier.
""The environmental protection drive could affect production of middle- and low-stream firms, easing demand for raw materials,"" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.
""Looking ahead, producer price inflation is likely to slow steadily due partly to the high base effect.""
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.5 percent in November.
As northern China officially entered the heating season in mid-November, the government has stepped up efforts to address winter smog, ordering many steel mills, smelters and factories to curtail or halt production to rein in pollution. 
Analysts expect producer price pressures to recede as the war on smog curtails production, cooling demand from factories for raw materials. 
Raw materials prices rose 7.5 percent in November year-on-year, compared with 9 percent in October, data from the statistics bureau showed. 
However, production curbs at factories have triggered fears of supply shortages, giving a major boost to iron ore and steel futures prices. Shanghai steel futures  rose 9.7 percent in November, while iron ore prices  surged 16.5 percent over the month.
In particular, the government's plan ordering millions of households in northern China to convert to gas heating from coal this year caused an unexpected shortage in natural gas supplies as prices soared despite a record amount of natural gas imports in November.
Oil and natural gas prices jumped 20.3 percent year-on-year in November, compared with a 16.5 percent rise in October, the bureau's data showed.
Coal mining and processing prices rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 19.7 percent rise in October.
The latest anti-pollution measures come on top of ongoing government efforts to trim down and upgrade the country's bloated industrial sector by shutting outdated capacity, which has also helped support producer prices.
CONSUMER PRICES SOFTEN
China's consumer inflation, which has stayed well within Beijing's 2017 target of 3 percent this year, also slowed more than expected in November to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent previously, as food prices fell.
Non-food price inflation quickened to 2.5 percent in November from 2.4 percent in October.
The consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to edge down to 1.8 percent on-year compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in October.
The world's second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with economic growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

But factory activity has shown signs of cooling in the past few months as Beijing extended a crackdown on financial risks, which has increased borrowing costs and weighed on new investment.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>",Investors pump Canada condo market despite broader cooling,"By Julie Gordon and Andrea Hopkins
VANCOUVER/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's two largest housing markets, Toronto and Vancouver, are being held aloft by booming condo markets as investors and developers stick to an asset they love, fueling charges that the market is geared toward building fortunes rather than homes.
Data released on Friday showed urban construction starts for multiple-unit buildings, typically condos, surged 16.9 percent in November to 175,016 units, a record high even after a decades-long boom.
Beneath a skyline of cranes, the majority of condos being built are one-bedroom or studio apartments aimed mostly at buyers betting on price appreciation, along with some first-time buyers seeking a foothold, rather than families or so-called end users seeking a house that will grow with them.
""Investors are looking for product that they can put the least amount of money down for and realize a profit when they resell it down the road,"" said Michael Ferreira, principal at consultancy Urban Analytics.
According to market research firm Urbanation, about 60 percent of units under development in Toronto are studios or one-bedrooms, a complete reversal of the trend before 1990, when nearly 70 percent of units had two or three bedrooms.
The condo boom is not meeting the goals of urban planners and Canadian families looking for an affordable alternative to the sky-high prices of detached homes. Instead, it benefits foreign and domestic investors looking for profit and income. 
Condo prices rose 21.6 percent in November from a year earlier in the Toronto region, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board's Home Price Index, far outstripping the 4 percent rise in detached home prices. In Vancouver, condo prices are up 23.9 percent in the same period, compared to a 6.1 percent gain in detached home prices.
""The massive (price) increases just attract more and more of that speculative investor creeping into the market,"" said Ferreira.
Government efforts to force developers to build ""family-friendly"" condos has resulted only in tiny three-bedroom condos suitable for students – in other words, more investors. 
Vancouver's General Manager of Planning Gil Kelley warned last week of ""a very extreme level of speculative investment,"" with most supply targeted at high-end investors.
While some industry watchers play down the impact of flipping on the market, both Ontario and British Columbia are working with the Canada Revenue Agency to track investors who evade paying higher speculator taxes.
But fears about the kind of condo glut seen in Miami are overblown, said Robert Hogue, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, because developers in the country do not break ground - or get financing - until most of their units are sold, typically only with a downpayment.

""There is effectively no building 'on spec' in Canada, and this is a sharp contrast with the situation we saw in the United States,"" said Hogue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth increased at a strong clip in November and wages rebounded, painting a portrait of a healthy economy that analysts say does not require the kind of fiscal stimulus that President Donald Trump is proposing.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 228,000 jobs last month amid broad gains in hiring as the distortions from the recent hurricanes faded, Labor Department data showed on Friday. The government revised data for October to show the economy adding 244,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 261,000 positions.
Employment gains in October were boosted by the return to work of thousands of employees who had been temporarily dislocated by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. November's report was the first clean reading since the storms, which also impacted September's employment data. 
Average hourly earnings rose five cents or 0.2 percent in November after dipping 0.1 percent the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent in October. Workers also put in more hours last month. The average workweek rose to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in October.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent amid a rise in the labor force. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 200,000 jobs last month. 
The upbeat report underscored the economy's strength and could fuel criticism of efforts by Trump and his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.
""The labor market is in great shape. Tax cuts should be used when the economy needs tax cuts and it doesn't need tax cuts right now,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""When politics and economics are mixed in the stew, the policies that are created often have a very awful smell,"" Naroff said before the report was published. 
Republicans argue that the proposed tax cut package will boost the economy and allow companies to hire more workers. But with the labor market near full employment and companies reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, most economists disagree. Job openings are near a record high.
The economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, the fastest in three years.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies after the employment report, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stock index futures extended gains.
FULL EMPLOYMENT 
While November's employment report will probably have little impact on expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Dec. 12-13 policy meeting, it could help shape the debate on monetary policy next year. 
The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. 
Employment growth has averaged 174,000 jobs per month this year, down from the average monthly gain of 187,000 in 2016. A slowdown in job growth is normal when the labor market nears full employment. 
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate has declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point this year.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full-time employment, ticked up to 8.0 percent last month from a near 11-year low of 7.9 percent in October.
Economists believe the shrinking labor market slack will unleash a faster pace of wage growth next year. That, combined with the tax cuts, would help to boost inflation.
The growth in employment was broad in November. Construction payrolls increased by 24,000 jobs, thanks in part to rebuilding efforts in the areas devastated by the hurricanes, after rising 10,000 in October.
Manufacturing scored another month of solid job gains, with payrolls increasing by 31,000 jobs after rising 23,000 in the prior month. Retail payrolls grew by 18,700 jobs last month, the largest gain since January, likely boosted by hiring for the holiday season. 
Employment at department stores increased by 3,100 jobs last month. Retailers, including Macy's Inc, (N:M) reported strong Black Friday sales. Macy's said this month it would hire an additional 7,000 temporary workers for its stores to deal with heavy customer traffic in the run-up to Christmas.

Payrolls at nonstore retailers, however, fell by 2,600 jobs. Government hiring increased by 7,000 jobs after declining for two straight months. Restaurants and bars hired 18,900 more workers last month.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts surged unexpectedly in November, driving a six-month trend to its highest point in almost 10 years, amid a continued condominium-building boom in Toronto, data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation showed on Friday.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of starts rose to 252,184 in November from October's downwardly revised 222,695. Economists had expected a decline to a 215,000 annual rate.
Multiple urban starts, typically condos, jumped 16.9 percent to 175,016 units in November, while single-detached urban starts rose 7.5 percent to 60,396 units, the CMHC report showed.
""This largely reflects construction of multiple units in Toronto, where evidence of overbuilding is low due to the decreasing inventory of completed and unabsorbed multiple units and strong demand,"" said Bob Dugan, CMHC's chief economist. 
The lower-priced but flourishing condo market in Toronto, Canada's largest city, is expected to continue to thrive, with buyers discouraged by high prices for detached homes, the agency said.
""Higher sales of pre-construction condominium units in the past two years will continue to break ground throughout this year resulting in more condominium apartment starts,"" it said.
Canada's lengthy housing boom has sparked fears of a bubble, but a foreign buyers tax imposed in Toronto in April doused demand through the summer, particularly in the more expensive detached market. The condo market has seen strong demand, however, spurring groundbreaking on new units.
""Home sales have slowed, but with builders focused on condos that are started well after most of the units have been bought, it's going to be a while before quieter sales offices mean fewer cranes on the horizon,"" CIBC chief economist, Avery Shenfeld, said in a research note.

""Home building will be a growth contributor in the next couple of quarters, but we expect a significant drag from that sector by 2019,"" he said.

Non-farm payrolls increased by 228,000 in November, following a 244,000 a month earlier that was revised down from the initial increase of 261,000. The data exceeded the consensus estimate for the creation of 200,000 jobs.
The jobless rate held at 4.1% last month, in line with expectations.
Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% in November, below forecasts for a gain of 0.3% and following to the prior month's 0.1% slip.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created more new job contracts than expected in November with a total of 221,000, compared to consensus expectations for 190,000. October's figure was revised down to 2472,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 252,000.
Government payrolls increased by 7,000 last month, after an decline of 3,000 in October and compared to expectations for a 5,000 gain.
The participation rate remained stable at 62.7% in November.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, ticked up to 8.0% in November from 7.9% the previous month.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours rose to 34.5 in November from the prior month’s reading of 34.4. Analysts had expected no change.

LONDON (Reuters) - British industry expanded in October at its fastest annual pace in almost a year, although a downturn in construction and a mixed trade performance left analysts split about the outlook for the economy in 2018.
Britain's economy has lost momentum this year as consumers suffered from higher inflation triggered by sterling's fall after last year's Brexit vote - though some exporters have gained from the weaker pound and the stronger euro zone economy.
Industrial output was 3.6 percent higher in October than a year ago, the biggest jump since December last year and broadly as expected by economists in a Reuters poll, official data showed on Friday.
But in October alone, there was no growth in industrial production and only a 0.1 percent increase in its factory output component, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Economists were divided over the data, which also showed the sharpest one-month drop in construction output since March 2016.
Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and a former Bank of England rate-setter, said the figures were positive.
Others focused on the lackluster monthly performance of industry and construction.
""Decent manufacturing and trade data, alongside a continued recession in construction, underscore the variation of UK growth between different sectors,"" HSBC economist Chris Hare said. 
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said weak industry and construction pointed to a 0.1 percentage-point drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The Bank of England said last month that it expects the economy to grow by 0.4 percent in the last three months of the year and to expand by 1.6 percent in 2018, after it raised its key interest rate for the first time since 2007.
Business surveys show factories are enjoying demand from a surging European economy, but also face an increase in price pressures.
A separate BoE survey on Friday showed that the British public expects inflation to overshoot its target by the most since 2013 in coming years.
WATCHING BREXIT
The outcome of Britain's split from the European Union is crucial to the outlook for manufacturers, who account for 10 percent of economic output.
The European Commission said on Friday enough progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin, ending an impasse over the status of the Irish border.
That should hearten British exporters, although they are still waiting on details of a Brexit transition deal and trade agreements.
""We need to pin down the transition arrangements ... to ensure it's business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the EEF manufacturers association.
The ONS said car production was a bright spot for the economy in October, helped by strong export demand.
Separate figures showed Britain's goods trade deficit in the three months to September was smaller than first thought, though the gap widened slightly in October to 10.8 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) from September's 10.5 billion pounds.
Still, exports in volume terms outpaced imports, helped by a resurgent European market.
ONS figures on construction disappointed again. Output dropped 1.7 percent on the month, worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll.

However, the downturn may ease in future months. New construction orders rose by a record amount in the third quarter, boosted by the new High Speed 2 rail project.

NIESR said this growth supported the Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade last month and represented a pick-up from a weak first half of the year, as well as the 0.4 percent recorded in the last quarter. 
""GDP growth at 0.5 per cent is somewhat higher than the economy's speed limit,"" NIESR economist Amit Kara said.

""If, as we expect, the economy continues to expand around this pace and inflation remains elevated, there is a case for the Bank of England to gradually raise the policy rate to stop the economy from overheating,"" he added.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 06:22AM ET</span>","UK public's inflation outlook rises to four-year high, BoE survey shows","LONDON (Reuters) - The British public expects the Bank of England to overshoot its inflation target by the most since 2013 in coming years and foresee the biggest chance of further interest rate rises in over a decade, a BoE survey showed on Friday.
The central bank raised interest rates last month, the first increase since 2007, and said more increases were likely as consumer price inflation held at 3 percent, its highest in five years, during September and October.
Policymakers keep a close eye on gauges of how the public think inflation will change in future. Entrenched expectations of high inflation can make it harder to return inflation to its 2 percent target.
The BoE's latest quarterly survey of the public's inflation perceptions showed that expectations for average inflation in two years' time rose to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent, its highest since November 2013.
Nonetheless, economists said the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee would be relieved by the relatively modest rise in public expectations given the increase in current inflation.
""The MPC will likely take comfort from the fact consumer price inflation reaching a five-and-a-half-year high ... has not led to a significant de-anchoring of inflation expectations,"" EY Item Club's chief UK economist Howard Archer said.
Britons see inflation in five years' time at 3.5 percent, also the highest since November 2013. The proportion expecting another BoE rate rise within the next 12 months rose to 63 percent, the highest since 2007.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said the central bank expected to raise interest rates ""very gradually"" over the next couple of years, although much would depend on how smoothly Britain departed from the European Union. It expects inflation will fall to 2.2 percent by late 2019.
Earlier on Friday, Britain and the EU broke an impasse over EU citizens' post-Brexit residence rights, outstanding financial liabilities and border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
While surveys of inflation expectations play an important role in economic theory and central banks' economic models, some policymakers view their implications as far from clear. 
Public expectations in the past have appeared to lag - rather than predict - future inflation, and many Britons still focus on the higher, but outdated, measure of retail price inflation which the BoE no longer targets.

The BoE survey was conducted by pollsters TNS and based on responses from 2,097 people in the days just after the BoE raised interest rates on Nov. 2.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 06:19AM ET</span>","China exports growth hits eight-month high, imports defy pollution curbs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports unexpectedly accelerated last month in an encouraging sign for the world's second-biggest economy, though analysts expect growth to continue cooling amid a government crackdown on financial risks and polluting factories. 
As global demand has surprised with its strength, consumers have lapped up Chinese goods at a rapid rate this year, giving the economy a boost and providing policy makers room to tighten rules to curb high-risk lending.
Exports in November rose 12.3 percent year-on-year, the fastest pace in eight months, led by strong sales of electronics and high-tech goods, while commodity purchases helped lift imports. 
The number beat analysts' forecast of a 5.0 percent increase and compared with 6.9 percent growth in October. 
Imports grew 17.7 percent year-on-year in November, the General Administration of Customs said on Friday, also well above expectations of 11.3 percent growth and rising at the fastest pace since September.
The numbers may help to ease concerns of slowing momentum in Asia's economic powerhouse, which had surprised markets with robust growth of nearly 6.9 percent in the first nine months of this year, thanks to a government-led infrastructure spending spree and unexpected strength in exports.
""While we still expect China’s domestic economy to cool in 2018 on gradually tighter financial policies, the November import data shows that there are upside risks to our China outlook"", said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
Tighter rules to rein in risks from a rapid build-up in debt and cut pollution have weighed on overall activity since the third quarter.
Besides ramped-up efforts to reduce winter pollution, authorities unveiled fresh regulatory measures last month for the financial sector, clamping down on high-risk lending and halting some dubious infrastructure projects that would swell local governments' debt.
IMPORTS BOUNCE TO TAIL OFF?
Some of China's northern provinces have ordered factories to throttle back or halt output to reduce notoriously thick winter smog. 
While the war on pollution had been expected to reduce raw materials imports, Friday's trade numbers showed commodity imports rebounded last month. 
China's natural gas imports in November rose to a record as domestic demand surged while crude imports were the second-highest ever, as refiners ramped up output to cash in on strong profits as fuel prices soar.
China's iron ore imports rose in November even as steel mills are cutting output as part of a government drive against pollution as some analysts said traders were stockpiling inventory. 
Iron ore imports ""were not necessarily just by steel mills but could have been also purchased by traders,"" said Helen Lau at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong.
""They're trying to accumulate stocks and will do so maybe through March in anticipation of Chinese mills resuming production when China lifts the winter restrictions."" 
Steel exports rose from the previous month to 5.35 million tonnes in November, data showed.
The rebound in imports come as China's yuan has fallen 2.8 percent against the dollar since hitting its 2017 peak on Sept. 8. 
The latest data showed the country posted a trade surplus of $40.21 billion for the month versus expectations for $35 billion in November after October's $38.185 billion.
China's trade surplus with the United States expanded in November to $27.87 billion from $26.62 billion in October. Chinese exports to the U.S. rose 14.3 percent and imports increased 4.2 percent. 
Exports to other major trading partners also jumped. Shipments to Australia and ASEAN each increased more than 18 percent from November 2016, while those to the EU rose 13.2 percent. 
Despite the overall strength of the November data, imports could come under pressure as China's economy cools, analysts say. 
""Chinese trade looks to have been surprisingly strong last month. We expect exports to continue to perform well in the coming months on the back of strong global demand,"" Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 

""However, we are skeptical that the strength of imports can be sustained given that the delayed impact of policy tightening and a cooling property market are set to weigh on Chinese demand for commodities in coming quarters.""

995,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 03:20AM ET</span>",BOJ's tankan set to show big manufacturers' mood improving,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - A measure of business confidence among big Japanese manufacturers is expected to hit its highest in more than a decade next week, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, buoyed by robust demand from overseas and upbeat corporate profits.
The poll also found that service-sector sentiment held steady on solid domestic demand and growth in the number of foreign visitors to Japan, although labor shortages could weigh on the sector's spirits. 
The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is set to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rose by 2 points to plus 24 in December, the poll of 17 economists found.
It would be a fifth straight quarterly improvement and the strongest reading since December 2006 when the index was at 25.
The index of big non-manufacturers' sentiment probably stood at 23, unchanged from the September survey, the poll found.
""Corporations retain upbeat profits thanks to economic recovery both in Japan and overseas and a weak yen,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But labor shortages and higher personnel costs may make corporations cautious going foward.""
Economists say that chemicals, steel, electric machinery and production machinery are among sectors expected to show upbeat business sentiment.
For non-manufacturers, areas such as construction and real estate are supported by the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. 
Economists forecast big corporations will increase their capital spending plans for the current fiscal year to March 2018 by 7.5 percent, a tad down from the 7.7 percent seen in the September survey. 
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers forecast business conditions would worsen slightly in the next three months, the poll found.
The BOJ will release its tankan survey results at 8:50 a.m. on December 15 (2350 GMT on December 14).
The Reuters Tankan, a separate monthly survey that closely tracks the BOJ's tankan survey, showed on Thursday that confidence among Japanese manufacturers held firm in December and service-sector sentiment rose for a second straight month.
OCTOBER MACHINERY ORDERS SEEN RISING Japan will release core machinery orders for October on December 13, which are likely to show a 3.0 percent rise from the previous month, the poll found. 
Core orders, regarded as a leading but highly volatile data series, tumbled 8.1 percent in September, the fastest fall in more than two years.
The core orders are seen likely to fall 2.8 percent in October from a year earlier. 

The Bank of Japan will announce its corporate goods price index (CGPI) on Tuesday. It measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, rising an annual 3.3 percent in November.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports fell unexpectedly in October while vibrant domestic demand pushed up imports, narrowing its trade surplus and adding to evidence that Europe's biggest economy started the fourth quarter on a weak footing, data showed on Friday.
The German economy, which is expected to grow by more than 2 percent this year, is enjoying a consumer-led upswing, propelled by record-high employment, rising real wages, moderate inflation and ultra-low borrowing costs.
Seasonally adjusted exports edged down by 0.4 percent on the month while imports jumped by 1.8 percent, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. The exports figure confounded expectations for a 1.0 percent rise while imports beat a forecast for a 1.1 percent increase.
""German industry has gone through a small rollercoaster ride since the start of the summer,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding that disappointing numbers had been followed by impressive rebounds.
""Behind the vacation and weather-driven white noise of monthly data, however, there is a clear upward trend,"" Brzeski said. ""The export sector has once more become an important growth driver in 2017.""
A breakdown of unadjusted figures showed that German imports from other European Union countries surged by 10.1 percent while those from countries outside the bloc rose by 4.8 percent.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.9 billion euros from a upwardly revised 21.9 billion euros in September. The October reading was lower than the Reuters consensus forecast for 21.8 billion euros.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, fell to 18.1 billion euros after an upwardly revised reading of 25.8 billion euros in September, unadjusted data showed.
The trade figures followed economic data released on Thursday that showed industrial output fell unexpectedly in October - a drop economists linked to public holidays that let workers take long weekends.
The weak figures came after data on Wednesday showed that industrial orders had risen unexpectedly in October, suggesting that output could bounce back in the coming months.
Rising exports and business investment in equipment helped the German economy to shift into a higher gear in the third quarter - it expanded by 0.8 percent on the quarter, up from 0.6 percent in the previous three months.
""This week's industrial data show that even the German economy can have weaker moments,"" Brzeski said, adding that the fourth quarter could bring a slowdown in overall growth.

For 2017 as a whole, the Ifo institute predicts economic growth of 2.3 percent which would translate into a calendar-adjusted expansion rate of 2.6 percent - the fastest pace in six years.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2017 11:20PM ET</span>","Japan's third-quarter growth twice as fast as first estimated, outlook brightens","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew twice as fast as originally estimated in the third quarter thanks to big gains in capital expenditure, revised data showed on Friday, with expansion seen to continue thanks to buoyant exports.
The economy grew an annualized 2.5 percent in July-September, handily beating the preliminary reading of 1.4 percent annualized expansion.The capital expenditure component of gross domestic product was revised to a rise of 1.1 percent from the previous quarter, well over the forecast 0.4 percent growth, and soaring above the preliminary 0.2 percent reading. 
Economists say the rate of growth reported on Friday is unsustainable, but they are still confident that the economy will continue to expand next year at a moderate pace. 
""The economy is doing well, but annualized growth above 2 percent seems a little too quick,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""I expect that exports and capital expenditure will lead growth next year, but the pace will moderate to around 1 percent.""
Japan's economy has expanded for seven consecutive quarters, and many economists expect growth to continue as consumer spending gains strength and export growth is seen on track to continue.
""You can say Abenomics is doing well and producing results. Monetary policy is contributing to nominal growth. Revisions to past data show the government's fiscal spending had a bigger impact than previously thought. The structural reform that has made the most obvious impact is allowing more tourists to visit Japan,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The government can be satisfied with these numbers. Prices are not rising that much, which is a problem for the Bank of Japan, but at this point officials are starting to worry about how to exit from their easing.""
Friday's updated third quarter data followed revised 2.9 percent annualized growth in April-June.
The initial second quarter data put annualized GDP growth at a stellar 4.0 percent, which was later revised down. 
Friday's revised third quarter figures showed that Japan is in its longest uninterrupted period of growth since comparable data became available in 1994.
This is a boon to the government as it is expected to agree later on Friday a spending package to subsidize education and encourage more corporate investment.
Friday's figure translates into quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.6 percent, versus a preliminary reading of 0.3 percent growth and the median estimate for 0.4 percent growth.
Capital expenditure was revised up because wholesale companies and retailers are increasing investment to deal with increased inbound tourism, a Cabinet Office official told reporters. 
Inventories contributed 0.4 percentage point in the third quarter, which was revised up from a preliminary 0.2 percentage point contribution, due to a build up of chemicals and plastics used in manufacturing, the official said.
Net exports contributed 0.5 percentage point in the third quarter, unchanged from the preliminary reading.
In one worrying sign, private consumption fell 0.5 percent in July-September, unchanged from the preliminary reading, as consumers spent less on cars, dining out, and mobile phone charges.
Weak consumption disappointed some economists who had expected a slight upward revision.

Real wages rose 0.2 percent in October marking their first rise since December 2016 in a sign a tight job market may finally be leading to higher salaries.

The short supply of candidates underscored the importance for the government of coming up with a plan to avoid a big loss of workers from other European Union countries as Brexit approaches, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.
""The government must make a New Year's resolution to ensure that the UK labor market remains successful in 2018,"" REC chief executive Kevin Green said.
The official statistics agency said last week that net migration into Britain fell by the largest amount since the 1980s in the 12 months after the Brexit vote, with more than three-quarters of the drop due to more EU citizens leaving and fewer arriving. 
REC said starting salaries, which in October rose at the second-quickest rate in nearly two years, rose sharply again albeit a bit less strongly than in November. The survey is an early indicator - though a patchy one - of wage pressures.
Last month, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in 10 years, in part because it expects the plunge in unemployment in Britain in recent years will soon start to push up wages.
Another survey published on Friday painted a weak picture for investment by businesses.
ICAEW, a body representing accountants, said its survey showed businesses investment would grow at its second-weakest pace since the global financial crisis, rising by 2.1 percent, and was likely to rise by only 1.5 percent in 2018.
""Businesses are responding to uncertainty around Brexit and the lack of progress on a trade deal and transition arrangements by building up their cash balances rather than investing in the UK's future,"" Michael Izza, ICAEW's chief executive, said.

Economists generally say that a country is in hyperinflation when the monthly rate tops 50 percent for three months or annual rates remain above three digits for three years.
The central bank reported inflation of 180 percent and 240 percent in 2015 and 2016, which had been the highest on record. It has since then stopped providing figures.
The Central Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Maduro says business leaders are arbitrarily inflating prices to destabilize his government. Critics say an unchecked expansion of the money supply has debased the bolivar currency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a rapid tightening of the labor market that bolsters expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week.
While another report on Thursday showed layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers rising to a seven-month high in November, the overall trend in job cuts remained low.
""Layoffs on the part of corporations are few and far between as good help is hard to find this far along in one of the longest economic expansions in the record books,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 236,000 for the week ended Dec. 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the third straight weekly decline in claims.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 240,000 in the latest week. Last week marked the 144th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Labor market tightness is seen encouraging the Fed to hike interest rates at the Dec. 12-13 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors awaited November's employment report due to be published on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 in November after surging 261,000 in October. Job growth in October was boosted by the return to work of thousands of employees, mostly in low-wage industries like hospitality and retail, who had been temporarily dislocated by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged in November. It has declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point this year.
A Labor Department official said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria battered the islands. He said claims processing in Puerto Rico was still not back to normal. 
The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are not included in the monthly payrolls report. 
Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged down 750 to 241,500.
""It's signaling an extreme reluctance on the part of employers to lay off workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 52,000 to 1.91 million in the week ended Nov. 25. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 1,000 to 1.91 million.
In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to cut payrolls by 35,038 jobs in November.

That was the most in seven months and was up 17 percent from October. The trend in layoffs, however, remains low. Employers have announced 386,347 job cuts through November, down 22 percent compared to the same period last year and the lowest since 1997.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will keep interest rates on hold and may stick to its description of the franc as ""highly valued"" next week despite a brighter economic outlook and recent weakening of the currency, a Reuters poll found.
The SNB will keep its target range for the benchmark three-month London Interbank Offered Rate at -1.25 to -0.25 percent, according to all 28 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
None of the respondents see any move on rates until September 2018. Their median outlooks suggest the bank will leave them unchanged through the forecast horizon running until June 2019.
They also expect the central bank to maintain its interest rate on sight deposits at -0.75 percent at its Dec. 14 update.
Both measures, designed to ward off cashflows into the safe-haven franc, have been frozen since January 2015, when the SNB upended currency markets by unexpectedly scrapping its peg of 1.20 francs to the euro (EURCHF=). The currency has weakened from 1.072 francs to the euro at the start of the year to nearly 1.17 this month.
The Swiss economy grew 1.2 percent year on year in the third quarter, accelerating from a weak second quarter as manufacturing and exports picked up.
Despite the franc's weakening, most analysts expect the SNB to stick to its assessment that the currency is ""highly valued"" next week, the poll showed.
In recent weeks, the SNB has been keen to stress the fragility of the franc situation, with Vice Chairman Fritz Zurbruegg last week saying the currency was still vulnerable to safe-haven pressures.
Most analysts expected the central bank to stay on hold until the European Central Bank makes its own move to raise interest rates.
""The franc is still too high for the SNB to be comfortable with increasing interest rates before the ECB does,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron.
Rasmus Gudum-Sessingo, a senior economist at Handelsbanken, said he also expected SNB policy to shadow the ECB, although the Swiss could eventually raise interest rates at a faster rate.
""But at present the SNB will be quite neutral – they have seen the franc weakening so don't want to disturb that,"" he said. ""They will want to be boring and not draw any attention to themselves.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production fell unexpectedly in October, data showed on Thursday, but the cause was probably public holidays that let workers take long weekends, the Economy Ministry and analysts said.
Industrial output decreased by 1.4 percent after falling by a revised 0.9 percent in September. The two successive declines came after an increase of 2.6 percent in August, the biggest rise in more than six years.
""Looking at the bigger picture, despite today’s drop, developments over the year 2017 so far confirm that the weak spots of the past few years – investment and industrial production – have gradually returned as a strong growth engine,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba wrote in a note.
""Judging from the data for the first 10 months of the year, industrial production has had its best year since 2011.""
Europe's largest economy is firing on all cylinders. Consumption, state spending and rising exports are driving growth in both industry and services.
Supported by low interest rates and a robust labor market, the economy is weathering a political impasse resulting from Chancellor Angela Merkel's failure to form a government since an election in September.
She is expected to open talks next week with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on renewing their coalition, which has governed Germany since 2013.
'SO WELL'
Surveys indicate that investors want to know how expensive an alliance with the SPD would be. The party is demanding more rights for workers, a broader social security net and significantly more investments in education and infrastructure.
Despite the political uncertainty, the economy continues to power ahead. Data released on Wednesday showed that industrial orders had risen unexpectedly in October, suggesting the economy will strengthen in coming months.
The October industrial output reading compared with the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 1.0 percent. A breakdown of the data showed that output fell in all industrial sectors except for energy.

""The favorable situation concerning orders and, above all, more optimistic business expectations promise a continuation of good industrial activity,"" the economy ministry said of the fall in industrial output. 
Capital goods, consumer goods, intermediate goods and construction fell the most.
""The irony of today’s drop in industrial production is that it probably reflects the strength and not the weakness of the German economy,"" Brzeski said. ""Apparently it is going so well that people and companies can simply afford to take some time off.""

The increase in the trade deficit was due partly to an increase in imports in the automobiles sector, and a dip in exports towards Asia of sales of products in the aerospace industry.
BACKGROUND
France has run a trade deficit every month since May 2004 as French firms have seen their share of international markets dwindle in the face of declining competitiveness. France posted its biggest monthly deficit in April 2011 with a trade gap of 7.024 billion euros.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers held firm in December and service-sector sentiment rose for a second straight month, the Reuters Tankan poll showed on Thursday, underscoring steady economic growth driven by both external and domestic demand.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, found manufacturers' mood up a tad from three months ago and service-sector morale holding steady, signaling a firm reading in the upcoming BOJ tankan.
Solid tankan results should be encouraging for the BOJ, which will scrutinize the survey readings, due Dec. 15, at its policy meeting later this month. Investors are expecting the central bank to maintain the current easing stance for now.
In the Reuters poll of 547 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 251 firms responded, the manufacturers' index was seen inching up in March while the service-sector mood was believed likely to slip but remain at relatively high levels.
""Following growing interest in AI (artificial intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things), we are receiving increasing inquiries from manufacturers about automation and efficiency,"" an electrical equipment maker wrote in the survey, in which companies respond on condition of anonymity.
Another electrical equipment maker wrote: ""The U.S. car market is maintaining sound performance even though it shows some signs of declining.""
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 27, unchanged from November after hitting a decade-high of 31 in October, according to the survey conducted Nov. 21 to Dec. 4.
The manufacturers' index was up two points compared with three months ago, on gains among industries such as electrical equipment, oil refinery/ceramics and steel/nonferrous metals. The index is expected to rise further to 28 in March.
The service-sector index rose to 34 from 31 in November, led by gains in retailers, an encouraging sign for private consumption that constitutes some 60 percent of the economy.
Compared with three months ago, the service-sector index rebounded to match a two-year high registered in September. The index is expected to fall to 31 in March.
The BOJ's last tankan showed big manufacturers were the most optimistic for the business outlook in a decade.
Japan's economy expanded for a seventh straight quarter in the July-September period led by solid external demand, with steady growth seen likely to continue in the coming year.

Policymakers hope a sustained economic recovery will boost wages and consumer spending, but analysts expect inflation to remain below the central bank's 2 percent target for some time.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",China's exports to Cuba slump as island's cash crunch deepens,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Chinese exports to Cuba have plunged this year in the latest sign of a worsening in the Communist-run island's financial situation, which began in 2015 with the economic crisis in its top trading partner Venezuela.
Chinese exports to Cuba slumped 29.8 percent to $1 billion from January through October compared with the same period last year, according to Chinese customs.
Chinese exports peaked at a record $1.9 billion in 2015, nearly 60 percent above the annual average of the previous decade. They slipped slightly last year to $1.8 billion.
China sends a broad array of supplies to Cuba, from machinery and transportation equipment to raw materials, chemicals and food.
The Chinese commercial office in Havana said the decline was due to Cuba's payment problems. China ranked as Cuba's first trading partner in terms of goods in 2016, followed by Venezuela.
The economic crisis in Venezuela, lower revenue from commodity and related exports, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma and the Trump administration’s tightening of business and travel restrictions have left Cuba without cash to pay some suppliers and investment partners.
Western diplomats and businessmen estimate Cuban state-run banks, which must pay suppliers, have fallen behind by anywhere from $800 million to well over a billion dollars since 2015.
""China's exports to Cuba are experiencing difficult times and the pressure continues for many businessmen due to the economic difficulties this Caribbean nation is going through,"" Hong Xiao, economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese embassy, told Chinese business representatives attending a Havana trade fair last month, according to news agency Xinhua.
Cuba’s trade in goods last year was $12.6 billion, compared with $15 billion in 2015, more than 80 percent imports.
The cash crunch and lower oil supplies from Venezuela have forced the government to slash imports and reduce the use of fuel and electricity, helping tip its economy into recession in 2016 for the first time in nearly a quarter century.
The island's economy relies on imports to fuel economic activity, so a drop in Chinese exports does not bode well.
“The fall in imports from China is a pattern more or less across the board and in part reflects the government’s efforts to balance revenues and pay debt,” said former Cuban central bank economist Pavel Vidal, now a professor at Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia. 
“That means less consumer goods and supplies for the productive sector, which effects growth,” said Vidal, who expects little if any growth this year despite increased government spending and foreign investment.

The government had hoped for a 2 percent increase in the gross domestic product after last year’s contraction of 0.9 percent.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 12:52PM ET</span>",U.S. unit labor costs decline for two straight quarters,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. unit labor costs were much weaker than initially thought, declining both in the second and third quarters of this year, pointing to very benign inflation pressures in the near term even as the labor market is close to full employment. 
Other data on Wednesday showed private-sector employment increasing at a solid clip in November, with the manufacturing sector adding the most jobs in at least 15 years. 
The signs of soft wage growth and tightening labor market conditions could further intensify inflation debate at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. Economists, however, believe that wage growth is being understated.
""The weakness in unit labor costs will undoubtedly be cited by many as evidence that worries about the economy overheating due to a tightening labor market are misplaced,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
""But we believe that the official wage income data being used for calculations have been distorted recently by income reporting being delayed in anticipation of tax cuts, and Commerce Department analysts may be misinterpreting information from quarterly tax records.""
The Labor Department said unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, dropped at a 0.2 percent annualized rate in the last quarter instead of rising at a 0.5 percent pace as reported last month.
That followed a 1.2 percent rate of decline in the second quarter, which was previously reported as a 0.3 percent pace of increase. It was the first time since 2014 that unit labor costs recorded two straight quarterly declines.
The downward revisions would suggest that inflation could struggle to rise toward the Fed's 2 percent target. The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure is currently at 1.4 percent and has been below the Fed's target for nearly 5-1/2 years.
COMPENSATION REVISED DOWN 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading higher and the dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed in volatile trade.
""Low unit labor cost growth keeps a lid on consumer inflation, but should be a boon for corporate profitability,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Compared to the third quarter of 2016, unit labor costs declined at a 0.7 percent rate. The increase in average hourly compensation was revised to down to a 2.7 percent rate from the previously reported 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. 
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, though this was down from 235,000 jobs in October. The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics. 
Services-sector employment gains led the advance, with the largest increase coming in education and health services at 54,000, followed by professional and business services at 47,000. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 40,000 jobs, the most in the ADP series history dating back more than 15 years, while construction shed 4,000.
""The job market is red hot, with broad-based job gains across industries and company sizes. The only soft spots are in industries being disrupted by technology, brick-and-mortar retailing being the best example,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. ""There is a mounting threat that the job market will overheat next year.""
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment. 

Economists polled by Reuters expect the government report to show U.S. private payroll employment grew by 190,000 jobs in November, down from 252,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is forecast to have risen by 200,000.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's premium office space has topped the charts as the world's most expensive for the second consecutive year, outpacing prices in No. 2 Midtown New York by 66 percent, according to property consultancy JLL.
Offices at the top end of the Hong Kong market command an average of US$323 per square foot (psf) per year in occupancy costs, which include rent, service charges and government taxes, according to the report released on Wednesday. 
In Midtown New York, the costs are $194 psf, while London's West End is $193 psf. 
A separate report published by property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield last week also ranked Hong Kong in the No. 1 spot for the world's most expensive prime office space, with an occupancy cost per desk space of $27,432, followed by London's West End at $22,665.
""For the same cost of accommodating 100 staff in a Hong Kong office, 300 can be accommodated in Toronto, 500 in Madrid and 900 in Mumbai,"" the report said. 
Supply shortages and high demand from mainland Chinese firms help fuel Hong Kong's premium office rents, but the city also has the world's steepest rental discounts in non-core business districts, according to JLL.
""Yes, Central is the most expensive, but if you look a bit further out of the CBD in Hong Kong, it's 64 percent cheaper,"" said JLL Hong Kong's head of research, Denis Ma, referring to the prime Central district. ""It is still very competitive.""
Office rents in Central rose 5.2 percent in the first 11 months of this year, Ma said, while the rents on the opposite end of Hong Kong Island edged up 2.6 percent.
The city's commercial property and land market has seen a series of record-breaking deals so far this year. 
Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing's CK Asset Holdings Ltd (HK:1113) in November announced the city's biggest real estate deal when it said it would sell its majority stake in a 73-storey office tower for a record-breaking HK$40.2 billion ($5.14 billion).

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 02:57AM ET</span>",Rise in German industrial orders bodes well for coming months,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders increased unexpectedly in October thanks to domestic and non-euro zone demand, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting this sector of Europe's biggest economy is likely to gain steam in the coming months.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods rose for a third consecutive month, with Economy Ministry data showing factories took 0.5 percent more orders in October than in the previous month despite bulk orders being below average for the month.
The reading confounded expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.3 percent drop and came after an upwardly revised 1.2 percent increase in bookings in September.
""Industry is continuing to fly high,"" said Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG. ""In light of the strong preceding months, the moderate growth in October is a good result.""
But he said high capacity utilization made him suspect the pace of growth would not pick up further despite bulging order books.
The German economy has been expanding since 2010 and gained traction in the third quarter but worries are mounting as Germany still lacks a new government more than two months after a national election.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives lost votes to the far-right in the September poll and are now hoping the Social Democrats (SPD) will agree to a re-run of the current 'grand coalition' after talks on forming a three-way alliance with the environmentalist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats failed.
Nonetheless, the Economy Ministry said strong order activity, combined with record-high business confidence, pointed to the manufacturing sector continuing to grow strongly.
A breakdown of the orders data showed foreign demand picked up by 0.5 percent as a 1.6 percent surge in contracts from outside the currency bloc offset a 1.2 percent drop in euro zone bookings. Domestic contracts were up by 0.4 percent.
Appetite for both capital and consumer goods increased in October, although demand for intermediate goods was down slightly.
In the less volatile two-month comparison, contracts were overall 3.4 percent above the level of the previous two months.

That chimes with other recent data, which has painted a broadly positive picture of the manufacturing sector. Engineering orders increased by 9 percent on the year in October while factory growth hit its second-highest in more than two decades in November.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 04:55PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit hits nine-month high; oil prices lift imports,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased to a nine-month high in October due to rising oil prices and the widening of America's long-standing deficits with China and Mexico.
The worsening trade deficit came even as exports to China and Mexico were the strongest in more than three years, which some economists said challenged the Trump administration's argument that the United States was being disadvantaged in its dealings with trade partners. 
""This leaves the Trump economics team empty handed when it comes to its mission to improve the unfair terms of trade which sent factories offshore starting a couple of decades ago,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap widened 8.6 percent to $48.7 billion, the highest level since January. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $35.2 billion and the deficit with Mexico surged 15.9 percent to $6.6 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall trade deficit rising to $47.5 billion in October. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the large trade shortfall, which was flagged in an advance report last week. 
Republican President Donald Trump has blamed the trade deficit for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth. Trump has ordered the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed in 1994 by the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
He told a group of pro-NAFTA Republican senators during lunch on Tuesday that the United States had trade deficits with ""everybody.""
""And that's going to be changing - it's already changing - but it's going to be changing fast,"" Trump said, adding that NAFTA negotiations were ""going to be very successful.""
NAFTA talks have stalled, with Mexico and Canada rejecting a U.S. proposal to raise the minimum threshold for autos to 85 percent North American content from 62.5 percent as well as to require half of vehicle content to be from the United States. 
TRADE DRAG 
When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit increased to $65.3 billion, also the largest since January, from $62.2 billion in September. The so-called real trade deficit in October was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion, suggesting that trade could subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter.
The government reported last month that trade contributed 0.43 percentage point to the economy's 3.3 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes a smaller trade deficit, together with deeper tax cuts could boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.
Republicans in the U.S. Congress have approved a broad package of tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. But the planned fiscal stimulus will come at a time when the economy is at full employment, which will boost imports and widen the trade gap.
""While U.S. domestic demand will strengthen, foreign producers will supply an increased share,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist Americas and Asia at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. ""We project the U.S. trade and current account deficits will widen.""
Imports of goods and services increased 1.6 percent to a record $244.6 billion in October. Goods imports were the highest since May 2014 amid a $1.5 billion increase in crude oil imports. Imported oil prices averaged $47.26 per barrel in October, the highest since August 2015. 
The country's import bill was also boosted by food imports, which were the highest on record. There were also increases in imports of cellphones and other goods. Imports from China and Mexico were the highest on record in October.
Exports of goods and services were unchanged at $195.9 billion in October as a surge in shipments of industrial supplies and petroleum was offset by sharp declines in and civilian aircraft exports.
Exports to China hit their highest level since December 2013, while those to Mexico were the highest in three years.
A separate report on Tuesday showed activity in the services sector slowed in November amid a sharp moderation in both new and export orders. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing index fell to a reading of 57.4 last month from 60.1 in October. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Last month, a gauge of new orders received by services industries dropped to 58.7 from a reading of 62.8 in October. A measure of new export orders fell 3.0 points while imports rose 0.5 point.

Eleven out of 13 analysts and traders polled by Reuters this week and last said the central bank would leave the rate<RSCBIR=ECI> unchanged. Three saw a 25-basis-point cut.
October inflation stood at 2.8 percent, within the central bank's target range of 3 percent, give or take 1.5 percent. But in the past two weeks, the dinar has lost 0.6 percent, prompting the central bank to sell 110 million dinars in the interbank market. November inflation will be published on Dec. 12.
""They are likely to be cautious; any further rate cut could push the dinar down,"" a trader who asked not to be named said.
""On top of that, a rise in pensions and public-sector salaries as of January will fuel consumption, possibly leading to higher prices,"" he said.
In making its decision, the bank may also weigh whether the U.S. Federal Reserves will raise its own interest rates in December. Such a move would tend to draw investors away from emerging markets like Serbia.
Serbia's parliament on Wednesday will start debating a 2018 budget. The draft budget passed by the government last week set the deficit at 28.4 billion Serbian dinars ($281.52 million) or 0.6 percent of economic output.
It forecasts the economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 2018. That is in line with expectations by International Monetary Fund, whose 1.2 billion-euro ($1.42 billion) loan deal expires in February.
""The budget is very well balanced, the dinar exchange rate is under control, the state does not overspend and we could end up with budget surplus even next year,"" said Ivan Nikolic, an analyst with the Economic Institute think tank.
""Inflation is under control and in fact the central bank does have space to lower the interest rate on Thursday. Whether they will decide to do that remains to do be seen,"" he said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's unemployment rate has been higher in recent years than previously thought, the state statistics office said on Tuesday, flagging further revisions that suggest there is still some slack left in the fast-growing economy.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in November from 6.3 percent in October but that compared to an initial estimate of 6 percent last month as the entire series was revised following the introduction of a new labor force survey.
The revisions showed that the number of people out of work peaked at 15.9 percent in late 2011, when Ireland was working its way through a three-year international bailout, rather than the 15.1 percent initially thought.
The Central Statistics Office said the new estimates were still preliminary and will be further revised next month.
Analysts at Davy Stockbrokers said that could imply big changes to the jobless rate as it will include migration trends from 2011 that were more positive than previously estimated.
""The unexpected inward migration flows captured in Census 2016 mean that the labor force numbers will have to be significantly revised,"" Davy's David McNamara wrote in a note.
""Recent commentary suggesting that the Irish economy is now close to full employment is, in our view, wide of the mark.""
Ireland's economy is set to grow faster than any other in Europe for the fourth year running, prompting policymakers to warn that it could overheat in the coming years if falling unemployment leads to excessive price and wage pressures.
Inflation has remained largely flat over that period, however, while data last week showed wages grew 1.7 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, down from 2.2 percent in the previous three months.
Research by two central bank economists in August also showed that the labor market had more spare capacity than official jobless numbers indicate, suggesting there was the potential for further falls before major wage pressures emerge.
Davy's economist McNamara also said that, at 4.5 percent below pre-crisis levels, the employment rate was still ""a long way off"" its 2007 peak and that the participation rate had a similar way to go.
""Taking this broad range of indicators into account suggests that the recovery has further to run,"" McNamara said.

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) decreased to 57.4 in November from the prior month’s reading of 60.1.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to only 59.0 last month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index decreased to 61.4 last month, 0.8 points below October’s reading of 62.2 and also below the consensus forecast of 61.5.
The New Orders Index registered 58.7 in November, 4.1 points lower than the reading of 62.8 in the previous month.
The Employment Index fell 2.2 points to 55.3 last month from October’s reading of 57.5.
The Prices Index decreased 2.0 points to 60.7 in November from the prior month’s reading of 62.7.
The ISM indicated that, despite the slowdown, it was the 95th consecutive month of expansion in economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector.
“The rate of growth has lessened in the non-manufacturing sector after two very strong months of growth,” ISM chair Anthony Nieves explained in the report.
“Comments from the survey respondents indicate that the economy and sector will continue to grow for the remainder of the year,” he added.
Following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1831 compared to 1.1833 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.3429 from 1.3428 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 112.75 from 112.73 prior to the publication.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was unchanged at 93.30.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets were trading mixed after the open. The Dow 30 slipped 17 points, or 0.07%, the S&P 500 inched up 2 points, or 0.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 37 points, or 0.54%.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 09:21AM ET</span>","Canada export sector shows sign of life, trade deficit shrinks","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's hard-hit export sector showed unexpected signs of strength in October, posting the first increase since May on higher shipments to the United States while imports continued to disappoint.
As a result, Canada's trade deficit shrank to a five-month low of C$1.47 billion ($1.17 billion) from C$3.36 billion in September, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a shortfall of C$2.70 billion. The deficit was the lowest since the C$1.02 billion seen in May.
Exports grew by 2.7 percent - the biggest month-on-month increase since March - in part due to higher shipments of energy products to the United States to make up for a recent drawdown in refinery inventories. Nine of 11 export categories posted advances.
The data most likely came too late to influence the Bank of Canada. Analysts expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged when it unveils its next decision on Wednesday. 
The central bank, which has long fretted about sluggish non-energy exports, says uncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement is one of the biggest risks facing Canada's exporters.
Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said that while the data showed encouraging signs, one month's figures did not make a trend.
""It will help them (the Bank of Canada) put a little bit more of a positive tone but I think overall they are going to sound cautious tomorrow, just given that NAFTA is the overriding piece of uncertainty right now,"" she said in a phone interview.
The Canadian dollar  initially edged up after the data, rising to C$1.2626 to the U.S. dollar, or 79.20 U.S. cents, from C$1.2648, or 79.06 U.S. cents, before the data were released. It later gave up all the gains.
""We're finally seeing the rebound we've been waiting for months ... the good news is that the gains are broad-based,"" Stephen Tapp, deputy chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Imports dipped by 1.6 percent on weaker demand for motor vehicles and parts amid work stoppages and planned shutdowns in the automotive industry.

Exports to the United States jumped 4.1 percent, while imports slipped by 0.6 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States, which accounted for 74.9 percent of Canadian goods exports in October, expanded to C$3.52 billion from C$2.02 billion in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity across the euro zone looks set to end 2017 on a high note after a busy November, according to a survey giving the latest evidence the bloc's economy was a star performer this year.
Growth accelerated last month as firms struggled to meet booming demand -- in stark contrast to Britain, where the dominant services sector lost some momentum as firms worry about what leaving the European Union will mean for them. [GB/PMIS]
""It confirms that the euro zone economy remains in rude health and the final quarter of the year is going to be very strong. We see a lot of momentum,"" said Angel Talavera at Oxford Economics.
Forward-looking indicators in the survey suggest the momentum will be maintained this month.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to growth, was confirmed at an earlier flash reading of 57.5, up from October's 56.0.
The PMI scaled its highest level since April 2011 and was comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
In less upbeat data, euro zone retail sales fell more than expected in October, official data showed on Tuesday.
""Warm weather weighed on clothing sales and therefore overall retail sales in October, but November's rise in consumer confidence to a 16-year high suggests that sales growth rebounded last month,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
Growth in Germany's services sector slowed a little last month, PMIs showed, but remained solid, while booming growth in France led firms to step up hiring to the fastest pace in 16 years.
Italy's services sector growth accelerated after slowing for three months, boosting prospects for continued expansion in the euro zone's third-largest economy, although Spain's grew at a slightly slower pace than a month earlier.
""There is a synchronized upturn in the euro zone -- it is not just a German story or core versus periphery,"" Talavera said.
But Britain's IHS Markit/CIPS services PMI, spanning businesses from hotels to hairdressers, slumped to 53.8 in November from October's 55.6.
""Political uncertainty and the consumer slowdown will continue to keep a lid on growth next year, even if there are some positive Brexit steps over coming weeks,"" said James Smith at ING.
Hopes for a deal on the so-called Brexit divorce deal with the European Union was thwarted by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) over border concerns on Monday.
BUMPER GROWTH
A euro zone indicator measuring new orders climbed to 57.3 last month from 56.6, a level not seen in almost seven years. As firms struggled to fulfil that demand -- despite increasing headcount sharply -- backlogs of work were built up at rates not seen in over a decade.
IHS Mar kit said the data were consistent with fourth quarter economic growth of 0.8 percent for the euro zone, faster than many of its peers and more optimistic than the 0.6 percent predicted by a Reuters poll last week. [ECILT/EU]
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry soared to a six-month high of 56.2 from October's 55.0.
That upturn coincided with firms raising prices at one of the steepest rates this year. The output price index held steady at October's 52.1.

Signs of stronger pricing pressures, alongside robust growth, will be welcomed by the European Central Bank which has struggled for years to get inflation anywhere close to its near 2 percent target ceiling.

1028,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 04:31AM ET</span>",UK Services Activity Eases More Than Expected in November,"Investing.com – Activity in the UK service sector dropped more than expected in November, dampening optimism over the British economy as the sector makes up approximately 80% of gross domestic product, industry data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) decreased to 53.8 last month from a reading of 55.6 in October.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to just 55.0.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The research group indicated that reading showed growth in November from the previous month’s six-month high and further noted that prices charged rose at the fastest pace since February 2008.
“Volumes of new work also increased at a slower pace, while the rate of staff hiring was the joint-slowest since March,” the report noted.
“Slower service sector growth comes as a disappointment after the improved performances of both manufacturing and construction in November,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
“However, despite the weaker service sector expansion, the latest survey data indicate that the economy is on course to enjoy robust growth in the fourth quarter,” he added.
Williamson specified that the three combined surveys suggesting quarterly growth of about 0.45% for the final three months of 2017.
“The big news is in relation to prices, with the PMI surveys pointing to the largest monthly increase in average prices charged for goods and services since August 2008; a time when oil prices soared just before the global financial crisis,” this expert highlighted.
Williamson said that the blame in November was once again on rising oil prices but also noted that firms reported the need to pass higher costs of a wide variety of inputs on to customers due to the increase in importation costs as a result of a weaker pound.
“As such, the survey data suggest that inflationary pressures have yet to peak,” Williamson concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3411 from around 1.3410 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8842 from 0.8835 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 150.91 compared to 150.88 previously.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded mixed, with London’s FTSE 100 gaining 0.28%. The Euro Stoxx 50 inched up 0.01%, France's CAC 40 lost 0.11%, while Germany's DAX slipped 0.02%."
1029,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>",German political impasse weighs on services sector growth in Nov: PMI,"BERLIN, Dec 5 (Reuters) - - German services sector growth slowed to a three-month low in November, a survey showed on Tuesday, as a political impasse following Chancellor Angela Merkel's failure to form a new three-way coalition clouded the outlook for business.
The sector remains on a ""solid but unspectacular"" growth path despite the fall, IHS Markit said, adding that the average reading for the fourth quarter so far was above that of the July-September period.
Its final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services fell to 54.3 from 54.7 in October, remaining well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The reading came in weaker than a flash estimate of 54.9, which had shown a slight pickup in momentum.
There have been concerns that prolonged political uncertainty in Berlin could damage confidence in an economy that has been growing since 2010 and even picked up momentum in the third quarter.
Merkel, weakened by losses her conservatives suffered at the hands of the far-right in a September election, has turned to the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) after talks on an alliance with the left-leaning Greens and pro-business Free Democrats collapsed.
""The impact of the breakdown of coalition talks has had more time to filter through to businesses, and nowhere is this more evident than in the survey's measure of future expectations, which is two points lower than the flash estimate and at its second-weakest in 2017 so far,"" Markit's Phil Smith said.
This was reflected in a sub-index measuring the outlook for activity falling to a level close to an eight-month low recorded in August.
The slowdown in service sector growth was offset by the robust performance of manufacturing, where the expansion reached its second-fastest level in more than two decades in November. That resulted in a final composite reading of 57.3, up from 56.6 in October.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services rose to 60.4 from 57.3 in October, the highest reading since May 2011.
The result was better than a preliminary reading of 60.2 and lifted the index further away from the 50-point threshold dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""The French service sector looks to be closing out 2017 on a firmly solid footing, with both business activity and new orders hitting six-and-a-half year highs in November,"" IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said.
He added that soaring demand coupled with a September labour market reform had inspired service providers to take on additional workers at the fastest rate in nearly 16-1/2 years,
with hotels and restaurants leading the way.
After strong manufacturing sector data last week, the latest service figures suggest the private sector is heading for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2011, Gill said.

IHS Markit's composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing data, rose to 60.3 from 57.4 in October, topping a preliminary reading of 60.1.

1031,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 04, 2017 10:16PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of Australia Holds Steady At 1.50%,"Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate at a record low 1.50% on Tuesday as expected.
For the full-text statement, see:
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy have improved over 2017. Labour markets have tightened and further above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. Growth in the Chinese economy continues to be supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, although financial conditions have tightened somewhat as the authorities address the medium-term risks from high debt levels. Australia's terms of trade are expected to decline in the period ahead but remain at relatively high levels.
Wage growth remains low in most countries, as does core inflation. In a number of economies there has been some withdrawal of monetary stimulus, although financial conditions remain quite expansionary. Equity markets have been strong, credit spreads have narrowed over the course of the year and volatility in financial markets is low. Long-term bond yields remain low, notwithstanding the improvement in the global economy.
Recent data suggest that the Australian economy grew at around its trend rate over the year to the September quarter. The central forecast is for GDP growth to average around 3 per cent over the next few years. Business conditions are positive and capacity utilisation has increased. The outlook for non-mining business investment has improved further, with the forward-looking indicators being more positive than they have been for some time. Increased public infrastructure investment is also supporting the economy. One continuing source of uncertainty is the outlook for household consumption. Household incomes are growing slowly and debt levels are high.
Employment growth has been strong over 2017 and the unemployment rate has declined. Employment has been rising in all states and has been accompanied by a rise in labour force participation. The various forward-looking indicators continue to point to solid growth in employment over the period ahead. There are reports that some employers are finding it more difficult to hire workers with the necessary skills. However, wage growth remains low. This is likely to continue for a while yet, although the stronger conditions in the labour market should see some lift in wage growth over time.
Inflation remains low, with both CPI and underlying inflation running a little below 2 per cent. The Bank's central forecast remains for inflation to pick up gradually as the economy strengthens.
The Australian dollar remains within the range that it has been in over the past two years. An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
Growth in housing debt has been outpacing the slow growth in household income for some time. To address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness, APRA has introduced a number of supervisory measures. Credit standards have been tightened in a way that has reduced the risk profile of borrowers. Nationwide measures of housing prices are little changed over the past six months, with conditions having eased in Sydney. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Rent increases remain low in most cities.
The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2017 09:10PM ET</span>",China's services sector grows at stronger pace in Nov: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector activity picked up to a three-month high in November, buoyed by a solid rise in new business, though the rate of expansion remained moderate and weaker than the long-run trend, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
The upbeat findings broadly echo those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector last week that showed activity accelerated at a faster rate in November, reinforcing the view that an expected slowdown in the broader economy would be gradual.[nL3N1NZ3NH]
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in November, up from 51.2 in October and the highest reading since August. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth, and any lower signals contraction on a monthly basis.
The index had plunged to 21-month low in September after hitting a three-month high in August.
New business also grew at the fastest pace in three months, with survey respondents reporting sales were supported by the addition of new clients and promotional activities. Companies slightly picked up the pace of new hiring as a result.
China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.
The services sector accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power that is being felt at home and abroad.
Sales during China's annual 24-hour shopping binge on Nov. 11, known as Singles' Day, exceeded combined sales for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States.
 Alibaba  (N:BABA), the Chinese e-commerce giant, reported its Singles' Day sales hit $25.4 billion, smashing its own record from last year and cementing it as the world's biggest shopping event.[nL3N1NG4YJ]
Unlike the official data, the Caixin survey tends to focus more on small and mid-sized companies, which have tended to be under greater strain than their larger, state-supported peers.
The Caixin survey showed service providers in China were able to pass through higher input costs to clients, as companies raised their output charges at the quickest pace since July 2015.
A number of surveyed firms indicated that greater prices paid for raw materials, fuel and salaries had driven the latest upturn in overall costs.
A survey of manufacturers last week also suggested input costs remained high, fueled by China's government's tougher pollution measures in a battle against thick winter smog.[nS7N1I3010]
Mainly driven by the strong reading in the service sector, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI - which includes both manufacturing and services -- rose to 51.6 in November, compared with 51.0 in October.
“The Caixin PMI readings in November showed the economy has maintained stability and there was no imminent risk of a significant decline in its growth rate. But we should be cautious because the economy may come under rising inflationary pressure at the start of next year due to continued price increases,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report.
The world's second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

But China's booming industrial sector is starting to show some signs of fatigue as higher borrowing costs, a crackdown on air pollution and a cooling housing market weigh on activity.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>","Australia retail sales bounce, economy seen loping along","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales bounced in October after months of lukewarm demand, a bright sign for spending in the upcoming holiday season as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) opened its doors for business Down Under.
The retail behemoth started taking online orders on Tuesday, ending breathless speculation about its arrival in the world's twelfth biggest economy. 
Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales rose 0.5 percent in October from the previous month, the strongest since May and above expectations for a 0.3 percent increase. September sales had only inched up by a revised 0.1 percent.
Sales were up across every sector with clothing and eating out particularly strong.
Australia's A$26 billion ($19.8 billion) brick-and-mortar retailers have been struggling amid cutthroat competition and as relentless price discounts fail to entice customers facing paltry wage growth and mountains of debt.
There are fears Amazon's entry could further stifle traditional retailers and suppress prices and inflation. 
Oddly, the ABS does not yet include online data in its headline retail series even though they account for more than 7 percent of total sales. 
That means Amazon will not feature in the monthly figures, though internet sales are easily the fastest growing segment of the market. 
The ABS does have an experimental estimate of online retail turnover and that jumped 11.3 percent in October to almost match last year's Christmas sales in dollar terms.
The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) expects Amazon to inject new life into the country's sluggish retail sector, helping local chains expand their customer base. 
""With the advancement in digital technologies across the retail sector, we believe online retail sales will account for 13 percent of total retail sales in the next five years,"" said ARA's executive director Russell Zimmerman.
GDP AHEAD
Figures for gross domestic product (GDP) due on Wednesday are forecast to show Australia's economy expanded by a solid 0.7 percent in the third quarter, from the previous quarter.
That would see annual growth accelerate smartly to 3 percent, with a rare contraction from the third quarter of last year falling out of the calculation.
The pick up is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is considered certain to hold interest rates at 1.5 percent at its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday.
A Reuters poll of 42 analysts found all but one expected a steady outcome this week, and 28 saw no hike until at least September next year. [AU/INT] 
Doing its part to promote growth was the public sector as it spent big on infrastructure. Analysts estimated government spending on investment rose over 5 percent in the third quarter, while consumption spending edged up 0.2 percent.
That impulse to growth should have helped offset a slightly disappointing trade performance, with net exports adding nothing to GDP when analysts had looked for a contribution of around 0.25 percent.
Strength in resource and service exports still helped the country run a trade surplus of A$3.1 billion last quarter, while the current account deficit narrowed slightly to A$9.1 billion.

The Markit/Nikkei survey released on Tuesday showed its Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 on a seasonally adjusted from 53.4 in October, which was the highest in 26 months.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 14th consecutive month.
The index for outstanding business fell to 50.6 from 51.5 in the previous month to the lowest level since February.
But the pace of new business was largely steady, dipping only marginally to 53.7 from 53.8 in October.
Business expectations rose to the highest level since May, though job creation slowed markedly with some firms noting that retiring staff had not been replaced.
Japanese services firms also continued to face rising input cost pressures, particularly as manpower shortages increased labor costs, but they were able to pass some of the increases to customers to relieve pressure on profit margins. Prices charged rose at the fastest rate in 28 months.
""Growth of activity in the Japanese service sector appeared to lose momentum slightly in November, following October's 26-month high,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nonetheless, the expansionary trend which has been apparent since October 2016 was maintained. Businesses remained optimistic that activity would rise in the future.""
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 52.2 from 53.4 in October.

Japan's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter due to strong exports, posting the longest period of uninterrupted growth in more than a decade. Economists expect growth to continue in the current quarter as consumer spending recovers from a recent bout of weakness.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell less than expected in October and shipments of core capital goods were much stronger than previously reported, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing that should buoy the economy.
Factory goods orders dipped 0.1 percent amid a drop in demand for both civilian and defense aircraft after an upwardly revised 1.7 percent jump in September, the Commerce Department said on Monday. 
""These data remain consistent with a solid upswing in manufacturing activity and an acceleration in corporate capital spending,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Economists had forecast factory orders falling 0.4 percent in October after a previously reported 1.4 percent increase in the prior month. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -seen as a measure of business spending plans - rose 0.3 percent in October instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.
These so-called core capital goods orders surged 2.3 percent in September. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, advanced 1.1 percent in October instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent rise. 
Core capital goods shipments increased 1.3 percent in September. October's upward revision to core capital goods shipments prompted forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to boost its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of percentage point to a 2.7 percent annualized rate. 
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) lifted their forecast to a 2.5 percent pace from a 2.4 percent rate. The economy grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the third quarter. 
UPSIDE RISK
""The shipments revision adds upside risk to our already double-digit forecast for fourth-quarter equipment spending growth, and the revised orders data show no sign of a slowdown in capital expenditures in the months ahead,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Business spending on equipment has increased strongly this year as corporations anticipated hefty tax cuts from the Trump administration. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have approved a broad package of tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data and the anticipated fiscal stimulus, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks were mostly trading higher.
Business spending on equipment increased at its fastest pace in three years in the third quarter, helping to underpin manufacturing. The sector, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being supported by a weaker dollar. 
The greenback has lost about 7 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year. Factory activity is also being boosted by businesses replenishing depleted inventories and strengthening global demand, helping to offset a slowdown in spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts.
In October, orders for machinery rose 1.9 percent after a 0.8 percent gain in September. Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders fell 1.4 percent after soaring 20.2 percent in September.
Orders for transportation equipment declined 4.2 percent, reflecting an 18.5 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders and a 7.6 percent drop in bookings for defense aircraft. Transportation equipment orders rose 4.7 percent in September.
Motor vehicle orders increased 1.3 percent after being unchanged in September.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI touched a five-month high of 53.1 in November from 50.8 in October and better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed
to a reading of 51.0. The upturn was driven entirely by the residential sector.
Commercial and civil engineering activity continued to contract, despite a marked easing in cost pressures. British finance minister Philip Hammond announced a series of measures on Nov. 22 to boost house-building, which has lagged demand for years and contributed to a sharp rise in house prices. IHS Markit said 70 percent of responses to the survey were collected before the budget speech.
Confidence about business prospects over the next year edged up to a three-month high but remained near three-year lows. IHS Markit/CIPS, which compiles the survey, said construction companies linked worries to political and economic uncertainty ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union.
""UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November,"" said IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore.
Costs faced by construction companies for materials increased at the weakest pace since September 2016. Some firms said price increases driven by the pound's post-Brexit-vote fall
had started to lose their bite, IHS Markit reported.

Construction comprises around 6 percent of British economic output. A PMI for the services sector -- more than 10 times the size of construction -- is due on Tuesday.

Economists had expected the index to inch up to only 51.0 in November.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that residential work drove the modest construction rebound, while commercial and civil engineering activity continued to decline.
The market research firm also pointed out that business optimism picked up from October’s near five-year low.
“UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
Moore also noted that the increase in confidence, the first in three months, was “attributed to increased sales enquiries and hopes that risk aversion among clients will recede over the course of next year.”

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank will cut interest rates to a record low next week and is likely to proceed with a further reduction at the start of next year in a bid to lift inflation expectations towards the official goal, a Reuters survey showed.
All but one of the 50 economists polled expect the central bank to slash the benchmark Selic interest rate by 50 basis points on Wednesday to an all-time low of 7.00 percent, following its two-day policy meeting.
The single dissenting forecaster, HSBC, expected a 25 basis-point cut to 7.25 percent. <BRTARGET=CBBR>
Most of them forecast another cut at the bank's February meeting but that was far from unanimous, with 18 expecting the central bank to stand pat.
Among those who predicted a February cut, 21 foresaw a final 25 basis-point reduction, to 6.75 percent, while nine saw a 50 basis-point decline.
That uncertainty may drive the central bank to keep its options open next week.
""In its last policy statement, the central bank said that if everything remained more or less the same, a 50 basis-point cut would be appropriate. Everything did, indeed, remain more or less the same,"" UBS economist Fabio Ramos said.
""But a lot can change before the February meeting - the reform agenda may be derailed, we might see inflationary surprises and, of course, the pace of recovery is not set in stone.""
He was referring to President Michel Temer's efforts to streamline the social security system and curb government debt, which lawmakers have resisted.
Concerns that inflation may undershoot the official year-end goal for the first time in two decades could drive the central bank to take a more dovish approach.
Lower rates could help Brazil's recovery from the deepest recession in a century, which received a boost in the third quarter with a long-awaited revival of investments.
The economic pickup has yet to generate any meaningful inflationary pressures, however, with employment gains concentrated in off-the-books jobs and firms sitting on abundant idle capacity.
Consumer price inflation has for months hovered below the bottom-end of the target range of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage point. Expectations for 2018 are also subdued, with a central bank survey of economists pointing to a 4 percent yearly rate.
Though a spike in energy prices helped to lift it from 18-year lows earlier this year, regulators unexpectedly opted for a lower power tariff in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. factory activity fell more than expected in November as a gauge of employment cooled, but the index continued to point to strengthening manufacturing conditions.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.2 last month from 58.7 in October. 
Even with the decline, the index pointed to growth ahead and was only marginally below a September reading that was the highest since May 2004. But the ISM's employment index slipped unexpectedly to 59.7 from 59.8, which could point to less strength in manufacturing hiring this month than analysts had expected.
""(The ISM reading is) consistent with robust growth in output, exports, capital spending and employment,"" said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
U.S. Treasuries yields edged down from session highs after the data, while the dollar and stocks were trading slightly higher. 
Even with cooler growth in factory activity, strength in the sector as well as in the broader labor market appear likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates later this month.
A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to slip to 58.4 last month, edging lower from a surge posted after hurricanes disrupted supply chains earlier in the year.
The ISM's new orders index rose to 64 in November from 63.4 a month earlier.
Other data on Friday showed U.S. construction spending rising more quickly than expected in October as public construction outlays surged and investment in private projects increased for the first time in four months. 
The Commerce Department said that construction spending increased 1.4 percent to a record high $1.24 trillion, the swiftest advance in five months. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending to increase 0.5 percent. Construction spending increased 2.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Outlays on public construction projects jumped 3.9 percent, the largest gain since 2014. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 3.3 percent. Federal government construction spending soared 11.1 percent. 

Construction spending outlays were revised higher for both August and September, which could affect the government's estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth. On Wednesday, the government said in its second estimate of the economy's July-September performance that GDP advanced 3.3 percent. Investment in both residential and non-residential structures subtracted from GDP in the quarter.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone factories had their busiest month for over 17 years in November in a broad based acceleration, a purchasing managers' index showed, despite them hiking prices at the fastest rate in more than six years.
Forward looking indicators pointed to the momentum continuing through to the end of 2017, capping off what is expected to be the best year for euro zone economic growth in a decade.
""November's surveys produced a clean sheet of improved PMI readings for all countries, resulting in the best performance for euro zone manufacturing since the height of the dot-com boom,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc climbed to 60.1 last month from October's 58.5. 
That was above a preliminary estimate of 60.0 and the second-highest in the survey's 20-year history.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday and seen as a good gauge of economic growth jumped to 61.0 from 58.8, its highest since February 2011.
Suggesting the expansion will continue through December, new orders soared, backlogs of work were built up at a survey-record pace and headcount was increased at the fastest rate since IHS Markit started measuring it in mid-1997.
That upturn came despite firms increasing prices. The output price index bounced to 56.8 from October's 55.8, a level not seen in over six years.

Inflationary pressures, alongside booming growth, will likely be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who announced in October a cut to monthly bond buying from January.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The race to build microchips to meet global demand for electronic gadgets is exaggerating Singapore's economic rebound, creating a potential headache for policymakers deciding whether to tighten monetary conditions for the first time in six years.
Over the last twelve months, the city state has moved from the cusp of recession to record some of the fastest growth rates in the developed world - a turnaround founded on an explosion in output from its burgeoning semiconductor industry. 
But despite wide-held expectations that the central bank will finally move next year to tighten by strengthening the Singapore dollar, the narrow base of that economic resurgence has some analysts questioning whether Singapore is ready.
""The problem is the sectors which are doing well don't employ that many workers...so the benefits onto the rest of the economy are quite limited,"" said Brian Tan, an economist at Nomura in Singapore.
Unlike most analysts, Tan doubts that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will tighten policy next year.
Tan estimates that the semiconductor industry, making microprocessing chips used in a host of devices like iPhones, employs only around 1 percent of the total workforce but accounted for nearly half of Singapore's 5.2 percent third quarter growth rate unveiled last week.
That growth rate is triple the comparable rate in Japan and more than double that of the United States and the euro zone.
More than two-thirds of respondents to a Reuters poll in October said they expect the MAS to tighten policy by strengthening the Singapore dollar next year. 
The MAS is one of the few countries that manages monetary policy through its exchange rate, rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band.
A pick-up in the global economy could also lean MAS towards tightening. This week, the central bank of South Korea, another trade-reliant economy, became the first major Asian central bank to raise interest rates in three years. 
So far, the government has stuck with a fairly conservative forecast for 1.5-3.5 percent economic growth next year, even though its expectations for 2017 have been revised up to 3-3.5 percent.
And asked about its outlook after the growth numbers were unveiled a week ago, the MAS merely said the monetary stance announced in October - where it kept policy steady but tweaked its forward guidance - remains appropriate.
LOPSIDED
Those who do not expect any change to policy next year see the semiconductor boom as off-trend and temporary, pointing to softness in other sectors. 
The construction industry, for example, has been shrinking for five straight quarters on an annual basis. 
Kenneth Loo, the President of the Singapore Contractors Association, told Reuters the rot could last for at least three more quarters.
""There is stiff competition driving prices down,"" Loo said.
Analysts say a steady 3 percent expansion in the services sector, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the economy, is a better gauge of Singapore's long-term economic health.
Other economic metrics also remain fragile.
In labor markets, there are more people looking for work than job openings. Wage growth has slowed compared to a year ago, and core inflation at 1.5 percent is running below the historical average.
""I think they (MAS) may stand pat in 2018,"" Andy Ji, a strategist for Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore said, adding that inflationary pressures are muted and growth could peak in 2018.
The biggest driver of Singapore's manufacturing boom is also likely to fade by the second quarter of next year, the president of the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association CK Tan told Reuters.
""This market is purely driven by the consumer. This is probably the traditional period where you should see a high manufacturing output, purely for the festive season,"" Tan said.
Tan said the momentum has traditionally slowed in the second quarter when the industry takes stock of inventories after the holiday season. Statistical base effects will also fade, given the high growth rates the sector has seen since late 2016. 
That slowdown would coincide with the first of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's biannual meetings in April.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) dipped to 50.8 from 51.0 in October, but was roughly in line with economists' expectations for a slight drop to 50.9.
While the index remained above the 50-point mark that devides growth from contraction on a monthly basis, it was the weakest reading since June and signaled only a marginal improvement in operating conditions.
Output and new orders rose only modestly, while input costs continued to rise sharply, pressuring profit margins. Firms were able to pass along slightly more of the price increases to their customers, but still had to cut staff at the fastest pace in three months to reduce costs. 
Optimism about the one-year business outlook cooled for the third month running, with some firms saying they expected stricter environmental policies and relatively subdued demand to weigh on growth. The confidence reading was among the weakest on record since early 2012.
Some northern provinces have ordered factories to throttle back or halt output to reduce notoriously thick winter smog, but the production curbs have triggered fears of supply shortages, lifting prices of finished goods such as steel and copper even higher.
The findings in the Caixin report contrasted with a similar official survey on Thursday which showed an unexpected pick-up in manufacturing growth last month, despite the expected drag from the air pollution crackdown and a cooling property market.
The Caixin version tends to focus more on small and mid-sized companies.
The environmental crackdown is creating uncertainty for industrial firms, with an executive at the nation's largest integrated copper producer Jiangxi Copper (SS:600362) saying costs are going higher as emissions standards rise. 
""For the most part, the manufacturing sector remained stable in November, although some signs of weakness emerged. In the fourth quarter, the economy is likely to maintain the stability observed since the start of the second half of the year,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
""Economic growth in 2017 is expected to be higher than last year, but it may come under downward pressure in 2018,"" Zhong added.
The world's second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with economic growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

But factory activity has shown signs of cooling in the past few months as Beijing extended a crackdown on financial risks, which has increased borrowing costs and weighed on new investment.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - In trying to solve a major economic headache, large fluctuations in food prices, Indonesia may have unintentionally exacerbated another: domestic demand, the archipelago's main economic engine, which remains stubbornly sluggish.
Consumer sentiment has been hitting record highs this year in the country of 250 million, which economists and retail experts have long touted as a future Mecca for consumer goods.
Yet growth in domestic demand has lingered at rates below 5 percent, underperforming headline growth this year. Officials in the government and at the central bank, which has surprised markets by cutting interest rates twice in recent months, have said they were ""baffled"" by how weak domestic demand was.
Economists and agricultural experts, however, point to a steady, three-year drop in the average real incomes of Indonesia's 40 million farmers, who account for a third of the labor force. In an interview with Reuters in November, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government needed to take a closer look at farmers' incomes, which are 3 percent lower in real terms than they were three years ago.
""We really need to watch what's behind these statistics,"" the minister said.
Farming experts say falling rural incomes are partly a side effect of recent government policies to stabilize food prices, which account for 35 percent of the inflation basket. 
RICE FLOOR PRICE
In 2015, the government set its floor price for unhusked rice of 3,700 rupiah per kg and has not changed it since, while consumer prices have risen 15 percent. 
That helped stabilize food inflation below 1 percent. But production costs, which include machinery maintenance, pesticides and fertilizers, have risen to 4,400 per kg of rice this year from 4,199 per kg in 2016, according to Dwi Andreas Santosa, a professor at Bogor Agricultural University.
In theory, the floor price should protect farmers from sharp falls, while allowing them freedom to negotiate upwards.
In practice, however, most rice is sold at or close to the floor price, because farmers rely on short-term loans to cover their production costs. The loans usually need to be repaid shortly after the harvest, leaving them little leeway.
That means at harvest time, a large supply of rice hits the market over a short period of time, weighing down prices. 
""Farming machinery from the government doesn't work, fertilizer is expensive and we're being played around during harvest, too,"" said Wignyo Sunarno, a 62-year-old farmer in Karanganyar, Central Java, referring to having to quickly repay loans often taken from rice traders rather than banks.
Finance Minister Indrawati said incomes will only improve if productivity picks up and the government is trying to help by investing in irrigation systems. Data from Indonesia's Planning Ministry shows that Widodo's administration aims to build 1 million hectares of new irrigation networks in 2015-2019.
That could solve some of the problems that face farmers like 57-year-old Bibit in Klaten, in central Java province. Because he depends on rain, he cannot grow rice in the dry season, when prices are higher.
""I haven't planted rice because rain is still rare,"" said Bibit, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. ""If my income came only from farming, it would not be enough,"" he said, adding that his pension as an air force retiree fills the gap.
NO SMARTPHONES
Things might get even worse.
In August, the government introduced a cap on retail prices for some types of rice, aiming to trim the margins traders and middlemen get from rice trading.
But farming experts warn traders are exacting lower prices from farmers, because living from one crop to another puts them in a poor bargaining position.
""You shouldn't reduce farmers income to provide good prices for consumers. This will only lead to an increase in the poverty rate,"" said Santosa at the Bogor Agricultural University.
Lower farming incomes are a significant drag on consumption as farmers, unlike urban workers, are more likely to spend than save as they aspire to catch up with city lifestyles.
Entin, a farmer in Majalaya, in the province of West Java, said the profit from her plot of land was falling, forcing her husband to leave the area to find work. She also had to fend off requests from her three children to buy smartphones she could not afford.

""Being a farmer is giving me headaches,"" she said, sitting in the living room of the house she shares with her husband's parents and siblings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A company is more likely to be denied funding and considered a higher credit risk if it is headed by a woman, according to a Federal Reserve report published on Thursday that shines some light on the so-called gender gap among small U.S. businesses. 
The 2016 survey showed a somewhat self-reinforcing cycle of women facing higher hurdles than men in not only securing loans but also in increasing profits, revenues and number of employees. 
Authors of the report by the U.S. central bank's New York and Kansas City branches said it could help explain why the performance of majority women-owned companies has lagged in recent years, even while their numbers have grown much faster than businesses run by men. One-fifth of U.S. companies had female bosses in 2015. 
The findings could improve ""efforts to help high-potential women-owned firms meet their financing needs and flourish,"" said Claire Kramer Mills, a New York Fed assistant vice president who co-authored the report, which focused on businesses with fewer than 500 employees. 
Among the starker gaps, only 47 percent of women-owned companies that recently applied for loans received them, compared with 61 percent of those owned by men, even while both groups sought funding at a similar rate. Some 48 percent of low-credit-risk companies run by women received all the funds requested, compared with 57 percent for men.
The results suggested discrimination might be at play both externally and internally. Among newer companies, 53 percent of those run by women said their credit risk was medium to high, versus 40 percent for men. 
The disparities across credit, collateral, and business performance could reflect, in part, that companies run by women tend to be newer and focus on less capital-intensive industries, such as education and health care. 
Still, the gender gaps in revenues and profits did not narrow even with older businesses, according to the report. 
The survey reflected responses from 15,991 small companies, 2,880 of which were run by women.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 12:08PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending cools in October, inflation firming","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in October as the hurricane-related boost to motor vehicle purchases faded, while a sustained increase in underlying price pressures suggested that a recent disinflationary trend had probably run its course.
Other data on Thursday showed a second straight weekly drop in first-time applications for unemployment benefits, pointing to a further tightening in labor market conditions that could soon generate faster wage growth and keep consumer spending supported, as well as push inflation higher.
The reports strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
""Today's number should support the case of the hawks and centrists heading into the next Fed meeting in two weeks' time,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent last month after surging 0.9 percent in September. Last month's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. 
The jump in spending in September was the largest since August 2009 and was spurred by some drivers in Texas and Florida replacing automobiles destroyed when Hurricanes Harvey and Irma slammed the states in late August and early September.
Spending on long-lasting goods like autos fell 0.1 percent last month after accelerating 2.9 percent in September. Spending on nondurable goods such as prescription drugs and recreational items rose 0.2 percent. Outlays on services increased 0.3 percent amid a rise in airline tickets for foreign travel and communication services.
Though overall inflation subsided as disruptions to the supply chain following the hurricanes eased, underlying price pressures increased again at a steady clip in October.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in October after a similar gain in September. The so-called core PCE increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through October, matching September's rise. 
The core PCE has undershot the Fed's 2 percent target for nearly 5-1/2 years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that she believed the recent weak inflation readings likely reflected ""transitory factors,"" but also acknowledged the low inflation rates ""could reflect something more persistent.""
WORST IS OVER
""It looks like the worst is over for this latest idiosyncratic downdraft in core consumer inflation since the start of the year, and that Yellen was right to stick with her guns and maintain that low inflation is a transitory phenomenon,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries edged down. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average index racing past the 24,000 mark for the first time.
With underlying inflation rising last month, so-called real consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in September. The weak real consumer spending prompted economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as two-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 2.2 percent annualized rate. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been lowered this week from around a 3 percent pace in the wake of data showing a large goods trade deficit in October and declines in wholesale and retail inventories. The economy grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the third quarter, the fastest in three years. 
Households are dipping into savings to maintain spending amid moderate wage growth. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing by the same margin in September.
Wages increased 0.3 percent last month following September's 0.5 percent gain. While savings climbed to $457.3 billion last month from a more than nine-year low of $429.9 billion in September, they remained well below levels seen early this year.
The saving rate increased to 3.2 percent after falling to 3.0 percent in September, which was the lowest since December 2007.
""The 'savings dip' will limit the upside to consumer spending growth in the fourth quarter,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
There are, however, expectations that wage growth will accelerate as the labor market tightens further. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 for the week ended Nov. 25.

Last week marked the 143rd consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia inflation is seen slowing to a record low by the end of the year before rebounding to near the central bank's targeted level of 4 percent in 2018, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
The forecasts of analysts and economists would leave room for the Russian central bank to further lower its key rate, after cutting it from 10 percent to 8.25 percent so far this year. 
A monetary easing cycle became possible this year as Russian annual inflation, once stubbornly high, has tumbled to post-Soviet lows. The central bank said in October it would consider lowering rates further in coming months. 
The median forecast of 20 analysts and economists polled by Reuters in the past week was for 2017 annual inflation at 2.9 percent, compared with the 3.3 percent seen a month earlier.
Inflation is then expected to accelerate to 3.8 percent in 2018, the poll showed, on the back of increased price growth as consumer demand recovers.
""With current factors, such as stable oil prices, the rouble rate and a moderate growth in economic activity, being maintained, our models show an average level of inflation would be below the central bank's target,"" said Danske Bank analyst Vladimir Miklashevsky.
The central bank said on Tuesday inflation expectations among households fell to all-time lows in November, which analysts said would support a decision to cut rates at its next rate-setting meeting on Dec. 15.
Poll respondents forecast the Russian central bank will lower its key rate to 8.0 percent at the December meeting and then to 7.5 percent in the first half of 2018.
The declining inflation reading is a good sign for the Bank of Russia, Rosbank, a subsidiary of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said.
""However, the volatility of this indicator from month to month and the persistence of negative assessments creates inflationary risks, limiting a quick lowering of the key rate,"" it said.
The poll also showed Russian gross domestic product (GDP) seen growing 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018.
The World Bank said earlier this week Russia's economy was now expected to grow faster than previously thought in the next three years on stronger consumer demand, but still faced risks from lower oil prices and further expansion of Western sanctions.
Analysts polled predicted the rouble at 60.50 against the dollar in a year from now, slightly weaker than the 58.40 seen last month. On Thursday, the rouble traded at 58.43 against the dollar .

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 for the week ended Nov. 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging up to 240,000 in the latest week. The data included last Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. Claims tend be volatile around shifting holidays.
Last week marked the 143rd consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. A Labor Department official said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands, whose infrastructure was destroyed by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 2,250 to 242,250 last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 42,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended Nov. 18.
The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 18,250 to 1.91 million. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which November's unemployment rate will be calculated.

Data released on Thursday showing the growth could help Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been facing criticism over the hasty July launch of a goods and services tax (GST).
The tax was aimed at transforming India's 29 states into a single customs union but it has hit millions of small businesses due to complex rules and technical glitches.
""Upbeat corporate earnings results have been reflected in the manufacturing sector,"" said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.
The manufacturing sector grew at 7 percent in the September quarter compared with 1.2 percent the previous quarter, the data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed.
The economy has broadly moved past the disruptions encountered after a shock ban on high-value banknotes in November 2016, economists said.
Gross domestic product  grew 6.3 percent in July-September, its fastest pace in three quarters, compared with 7.5 percent a year earlier, the data showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast annual growth of 6.4 percent in the quarter.
Economic growth picked up from 5.7 percent in April-June, but lagged China's 6.8 percent and Philippines' 6.9 percent for the three months through September.
In July-September, auto sales, manufacturing, construction, electricity generation grew more quickly than in the previous quarter.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>",Small euro zone inflation rise matches ECB expectations of coming dip,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose less then expected in November, indicating that price growth remains weak and reinforcing European Central Bank expectations for a dip around the turn of the year.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 1.5 percent in November from 1.4 percent a month earlier, missing expectations for 1.6 percent, despite a surge in oil price that increased energy costs, data from Eurostat showed on Thursday.
The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent but has missed this objective for nearly five years as the euro zone is still just emerging from its deepest economic crisis in generations with over 14 million people still out of work.
To revive growth, the ECB has used its entire arsenal. It has cut rates into negative territory, given banks nearly unlimited access to cheap funding, and bought over 2 trillion euros worth of bonds to depress borrowing costs.
The work has paid off. Seven million jobs have been created and growth is now into its fifth year with weaker countries finally enjoying many of the benefits.
But inflation is still expected to head below 1 percent in the coming months as favorable figures from a year earlier get knocked from the data series and price growth will only head back over 1.5 percent in 2019, ECB projections show.
SLACK
Part of the reason is that labor market slack is likely bigger than official figures show.
While unemployment dipped to 8.8 percent in October, the lowest since the start of 2009, the actual slack may be twice as high, if data included part time workers seeking more hours or those excluded for various statistical reasons, the ECB said earlier.
But in a comforting sign for the central bank, core inflation or price excluding volatile food and energy, held steady at 1.1 percent, defying expectations for a small drop, suggesting that underlying price pressures are at least holding steady.
Still, with most of the big central banks around the globe struggling to prop up inflation, some have argued that weak price pressures have become a global phenomenon, increasingly outside the control of individual central banks.
""Over a two to three year period, which the ECB targets, inflation appears to be less of a monetary but rather an increasingly global phenomenon beyond individual central banks’ control,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer argued.
""Global factors explain an increasing part of national inflation, whereas domestic factors such as national unemployment rates are becoming less relevant,"" Kraemer said.
This would suggest that more stimulus from the ECB will do little to accelerate price growth.
Indeed, a fresh Reuters poll indicated that markets see inflation easing to 1.4 percent next year from this year's 1.5 percent before a marginal rise to 1.6 percent, despite unprecedented central bank stimulus.
Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank chief and a long-time critic of ECB policy, even argued that the bank was already fulfilling its mandate, so it should phase out its asset buys.

""The reflating economy will ultimately translate into increased pressure on wages and prices,"" Knot said on Wednesday. ""This may however take time. Central banks can only affect the price level with long and uncertain lags.""

The upbeat data should help ease concerns, for now, that Beijing's campaign to curb excess risk in the financial sector and its punishing war on smog could lead to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China's economy.
""A lot of people (predicted) a cyclical slowdown, but we haven't seen that...it looks like the current momentum can be sustained until at least early next year,"" said Zhou Hao, senior Asia emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday stood at 51.8 in November, compared with 51.6 in October.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis for the 16th straight month.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast it would come in at 51.4, easing for a second straight month after September's more than five-year high.
Boosted by hefty government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturing and industrial firms have been a major driver behind the economy's forecast-beating growth of nearly 6.9 percent so far this year.
November's strong reading was led by high-tech and consumer goods manufacturing, statistics official Zhao Qinghe said in comments published with the data, though Zhao said some traditional industries continued to struggle.
October economic data disappointed analysts as investment, industrial output and export growth slowed, raising concerns that a long-expected slowdown had begun, though Thursday's PMIs suggested there was still solid momentum in China's massive manufacturing sector.
Still, some economists see fourth-quarter economic growth moderating to around 6.6 percent, and slowing further to 6.4 percent in 2018, as borrowing costs rise and the boost from earlier infrastructure projects begins to fade.
""We doubt the current momentum in manufacturing will be sustained given that the sector faces increasing headwinds in the months ahead from the anti-pollution crackdown, slower credit growth, reduced fiscal support and a cooling property market,"" Capital Economics economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.
A senior banking regulator said on Thursday that China's economy could face downward risks as soon as the first quarter next year as the economy struggles for sustainable growth in the face of government efforts to deflate asset bubbles.
PRICE BOOST
For now, though, strong commodity prices are continuing to boost the performance of industrial firms such as steelmakers, which have cranked up production to cash in on robust profit margins.
While some mills, smelters and factories in northern provinces have been forced to curb output to reduce winter smog, there are signs that their counterparts in other parts of the country have ramped up output to gain market share.
A separate PMI on the steel sector rose to 53.1 in November from 52.3 in October, while a reading on steel raw materials jumped 12.6 points to 56.7.
Indeed, Chinese steel futures jumped nearly 3 percent on Wednesday to their strongest level since mid-September as winter curbs reduced stockpiles to the lowest in years.
Profits for China's industrial powerhouses surged 25.1 percent in October, down only slightly from September's nearly six year high, as coal mining and other upstream sectors continued to benefit from high prices.
Earnings have been boosted by surging factory gate prices, though the latest survey showed input price gains slowed, with the reading at 59.8 compared to 63.4 in October and the lowest since July.
Output price gains also slowed, reflecting concerns that higher commodity prices have not trickled down to higher prices and profit margins for downstream industries.
The latest pollution closures come on top of ongoing government efforts to trim down and upgrade the country's bloated industrial sector by shutting down outdated capacity, which also has helped support producer prices.
A sub-reading for output rose to 54.3 in November from 53.4 the previous month as factories continue to expand production.
Readings for total new orders, new export orders and imports also quickened.
The PMI showed that large firms continued to be the best performers in November, though the gap between smaller firms narrowed from the previous month.
But the environmental crackdown is creating uncertainty for industrial firms, with an executive at the nation's largest integrated copper producer Jiangxi Copper (SS:600362) saying costs are going higher as emissions standards rise.
A sister survey also showed activity in China's service sector accelerated at a faster rate in November, reinforcing the view that any slowdown in the economy would be gradual.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 from 54.3 in October.
A sub-reading for the construction sector rose to 61.4 from 58.5 in October.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.

China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2017 08:10PM ET</span>","Japan October industrial output rebounds, manufacturers see good times ahead","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose less than expected in October, but companies forecast production to rise strongly in November and December as robust overseas demand continues to support factory activity and broader economic growth.
The 0.5 percent increase in October was less than the median market projection for a 1.9 percent increase and followed a revised 1.0 percent decline in September.
Though October's performance was slightly disappointing, forecasts for an acceleration in factory output suggest Japan could extend its longest uninterrupted period of growth in more than a decade as exports and domestic demand drive the economy.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 2.8 percent in November and 3.5 percent in December. 
""I expect the economy to continue expanding,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Industrial production forecasts suggest we will see some good numbers in October-December, but we need to confirm that companies actually ramp up production as much as they expect to,"" Tonouchi said.
Industrial output rose in October due to increased production of semiconductors, car parts, and machines used to make flat panel displays, trade ministry data showed on Thursday.
A breakdown of forecasts for December shows that makers of construction equipment and heavy machinery needed to manufacture other goods expect their output to rise to a record high in December, a trade ministry official told reporters at a briefing.
This reflects strong global demand for capital goods and increased capital expenditure overseas, the official said.
The industrial output data is yet another reason for optimism about the economic outlook.
Many economists expect consumer spending to rebound in the second half of this year due to a tight labor market.
Capital expenditure is also likely to continue expanding as companies invest in new equipment to deal with labor shortages and capacity constraints, economists say.
Japan's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter thanks to strong exports, posting the longest period of uninterrupted growth in more than a decade, data showed earlier this month.

The Bank of Japan is likely to point to the country's steady economic growth as an indication that price pressures will eventually build up and inflation reach the central bank's 2 percent target.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","UK consumer sentiment sinks to 16-month low, business mixed","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's closest-watched gauge of consumer sentiment fell this month to its lowest since just after last year's Brexit vote, and business morale also softened, as households and firms took a darker view of the economic outlook.
The GfK consumer confidence index dropped by 2 points to -12 in November, its lowest since July 2016 and below the average forecast of a decline to -11 in a Reuters poll.
""Sadly there's no festive cheer,"" said Joe Staton, an executive at the market research company. ""Household jitters following the recent interest rate hike, squeezed incomes, higher inflation and economic uncertainty have dampened the consumer mood across the UK.""
Britain's economy has slowed this year as higher inflation - largely due to the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote last year - pushed up costs for households and businesses.
At the start of the month, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in over a decade to tackle inflation that is at a five-year high, and last week government forecasters slashed their growth outlook.
GfK said households' willingness to make major purchases was the fastest-falling element of its index, falling to its lowest level since October 2014 in bad news for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.
A separate survey by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed business confidence slipped this month - with their economic optimism the lowest since June 2016 - though figures from the British Chambers of Commerce suggested exporters are enjoying strong sales.
""Firms are confident about their future, although the fall in economic optimism is an indication of economic and political uncertainties ahead,"" said Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Commercial Banking.
British Prime Minister Theresa May hopes to move Brexit talks on to trade negotiations after a meeting with European Union leaders next month. But she first needs to make progress on Britain's outstanding bills, the rights of EU citizens in Britain, and future border arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.
British media reported on Tuesday that May was ready to pay around 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to leave the EU.
The BCC said exporters were benefiting from a weaker pound that made their prices more competitive, as well as stronger demand from the faster-growing euro zone economy.
The volume of trade documentation - a leading indicator for export volumes - was 4 percent higher than a year earlier and its third highest since records began in 2004.
But some exporters were suffering from higher raw materials costs or staff shortages.
""The depreciation of sterling has undoubtedly benefited some firms, but has ratcheted costs up significantly for others,"" BCC director-general Adam Marshall said. 
""Taken together with higher domestic costs ... a tipping point may soon be reached for some firms – with consequences for investment, recruitment and trade,"" he added.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2017 03:16PM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter economic growth fastest in three years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the third quarter, notching its quickest pace in three years, buoyed by robust business spending on equipment and an accumulation of inventories.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.3 percent annual rate last quarter also boosted by a rebound in government investment, the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate on Wednesday. That was the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a pickup from the second quarter's 3.1 percent rate.
The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 3.0 percent pace in the July-September period. It was the first time since 2014 that the economy experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two straight quarters. 
The growth pace, however, likely exaggerates the health of the economy as inventories, goods yet to be sold, accounted for nearly a quarter of GDP growth. Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.5 percent rate. When measured from the income side, output also expanded at a 2.5 percent rate. 
""While welcomed improvement, the sustainability of growth has been reliant on pent-up demand and stockpiling of goods after grossly depleting inventories,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago. Economists had expected that third-quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 3.2 percent rate. The brisk growth pace strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday ""the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors,"" and that she expected that ""the economy will continue to expand.""
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell on the data and Yellen's remarks. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while stocks were mixed.
The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama's first term.
Economists see a modest boost to growth from efforts by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress to push through a broad package of tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. 
Trump wants lower taxes to lift annual GDP growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis. The fiscal stimulus would, however, come when the economy is at full employment.
""Corporate and personal income tax cuts will have minimal impact on growth over the longer run,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""In 2019 and beyond growth will settle in to its long-run average of 2 percent to 2.25 percent.""
CORPORATE PROFITS RISE
The government said after-tax corporate profits surged at a 5.8 percent rate last quarter after rising at only a 0.1 percent pace in the second quarter. Undistributed profits jumped at a 13.9 percent rate after declining for two straight quarters, suggesting that companies were anticipating deep tax cuts.
Businesses accumulated inventories at a $39.0 billion pace in the third quarter, instead of the previously reported $35.8 billion rate. As a result, inventory investment contributed 0.8 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth, up from the previously reported 0.73 percentage point. 
That suggests inventories could be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter. Data on Tuesday showed a drop in wholesale and retail inventories in October, leading economists to slash their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as five-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 2.3 percent rate. 
The Fed on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide described economic activity as having ""continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace in October and mid-November.""
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, was revised down to a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter from the previously reported 2.4 percent pace. Consumer spending increased at a robust 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter. 
The deceleration in consumer spending likely reflects the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida during the third quarter. Spending is also being constrained by sluggish wage growth, which is forcing households to dip into their savings to fund purchases.
The government cut its estimate for the increase in second-quarter wages and salaries by $26.5 billion. The saving rate decreased to 3.3 percent in the third quarter from 3.7 percent in the April-June period. 
Economists say savings cannot drive consumer spending indefinitely. But they also believe that income growth is being understated, pointing to a 4.1 percent unemployment rate as well as strong business investment.
Growth in business investment in equipment was raised to a 10.4 percent pace, the fastest in three years, from the previously reported 8.6 percent rate. Businesses also increased spending on software.
But investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 6.8 percent pace in the third quarter, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015, instead of the previously estimated 5.2 percent rate. That is largely because of a slowdown in spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts. 

Growth in government spending was raised to a 0.4 percent rate. Government outlays were previously reported to have declined at a 0.1 percent pace in the third quarter. Government spending had contracted for two consecutive quarters.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through November 17, showed wage growth continued to improve, while price pressures strengthened, rising expectations that the trend of slowing inflation was beginning to fade.
“Economic activity continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace in October and mid-November, according to anecdotal reports from contacts across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts,” according to the report released Wednesday in Washington. ""Price pressures have strengthened since the last report. Most Districts reported modest to moderate growth in selling prices and moderate increases in non-labor input costs.""
The improved outlook on inflation comes as the most recent reading of the Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – retreated to 1.3% in September on year-on-year.
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen recently described the trend of slowing inflation as “dangerous” warning that low inflation limits the potential of further rate hikes, diminishing the Federal Reserve’s ability to respond the subsequent crises.
“It can be quite dangerous to allow inflation to drift down and not to achieve over time a central bank’s inflation target,” Yellen said last week.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index rose to a reading of 109.3. September's index was downwardly revised to 105.6.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 1.0 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
The housing sector has regained some momentum recently after treading water for much of the year because of a lack of inventory which has driven up prices, and both labor and land shortages.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were still down 0.6 percent. Contracts surged 7.4 percent in the South as it snapped back after the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September. Sales also increased in the Northeast and Midwest while they fell 0.7 percent in the West.
The NAR said that the number of homes for sale in October was the lowest for the month since 1999.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment rose in November for the sixth consecutive month to its highest level in more than 17 years, data from the European Commission showed on Wednesday, while inflation expectations grew.
The new rise confirmed the solid economic recovery of the 19-country currency bloc despite the strong euro and political crisis in two of its largest members, Germany and Spain.
The buoyant sentiment was also compounded by expectations of higher prices among manufacturers and consumers, a positive signal for the European Central Bank's efforts to raise inflation closer to target.
The European Commission's monthly survey showed that sentiment in the euro zone rose to 114.6 in November from 114.1 in October, in line with the average forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
It was the highest reading since October 2000, and well above the long-term average of 100.0.
The Commission's overall business climate index, a separate indicator which points to the phase of the business cycle, also rose to 1.49 in November from 1.44 in October, the highest level in 10 years, albeit below market expectations of a rise to 1.53.
Optimism kept growing in the industrial sector, reaching 8.2 points, its highest level ever since 1990, when data began to be collected. 
Consumers' exuberance was also confirmed from earlier estimates at 0.1, the first positive reading since January 2001 and a near 17-year high.
British consumers joined the positive trend, as their confidence rose to -5.2 points from -5.5 in October. The Commission figures showed the opposite trend emerged from a poll by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, which pointed to UK consumer confidence slumping in November.
In the euro zone, economic sentiment improved in November in all surveyed sectors, excluding retail trade, where it fell to 4.2 from 5.5 in October.
INFLATION
Optimism in the industry sector was in part driven by expectations of higher selling prices which jumped to 11.1 from 8.7 points last month, as Christmas shopping approaches.
Consumers also expected more inflation in the coming months, a forecast that is seen restraining their purchases, but that sends a further positive signal to the ECB, which aims to bring inflation close to 2 percent.
Inflation was at 1.4 percent in October on the year. The average forecast of economists polled by Reuters points to an acceleration to 1.6 percent in November. Official flash estimates will be released on Thursday by the EU statistics office Eurostat.
Economists, however, remained cautious and saw no signs of earlier moves by the ECB on rates.
""Inflation expectations are rising only slowly. This supports the ECB's very gradual approach to normalizing monetary policy. We think that it will wait until late 2019 to raise interest rates,"" Jack Allen of research firm Capital Economics said.
Inflation expectations went down in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, despite the general booming trend. 

""This indicates that not much is to be expected of inflation in 2018, even with improving economic conditions,"" said Bert Colijn, economist at ING bank.

The growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 9.6 percent in the year to October from September's 9.8 percent, the slowest increase since April 2016.
Earlier on Wednesday BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said he did not think British households as a whole were going on a ""debt-fueled binge"" but added that fast rates of consumer credit growth needed to be watched.
The number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 64,575 in October, its lowest since September last year, slightly below economists' average forecast for a decline to 65,000 in a Reuters poll.
Britain's housing market has slowed since June 2016's vote to leave the European Union, contributing to a fall in confidence among consumers who are also being hit by high inflation and low wage growth.
In cash terms, net consumer lending rose by 1.451 billion pounds last month, again slightly below economists' forecasts of a 1.5 billion pound increase.
The BoE raised interest rates this month for the first time in 10 years but said it did not expect the increase in borrowing costs to represent a big blow to household finances. The BoE has also urged banks to ensure they are not taking too much risk in their lending to consumers.

The third quarter GDP (gross domestic product) growth reading of 0.5 percent was in line with an earlier estimate, and followed growth of 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
October consumer spending fell by 1.9 percent from the previous three months, which INSEE partly attributed to a decline in spending on gas and electricity due to warmer-than-average temperatures, and less money spent on household goods.
France, the second-biggest economy in the euro zone, is forecast by President Emmanuel Macron's government to grow 1.7 percent in 2017, which would mark its strongest performance since 2011.
""French assets have been trading on a slight premium to the rest of Europe, and that has partly reflected the fact that investors have been enthused by the start of Macron's presidency,"" said Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management, which manages around 40 billion euros ($47.5 billion) of assets.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 09:58PM ET</span>",Japan retail sales suffer first annual fall in a year,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Annual Japanese retail sales fell for the first time in a year last month, government data showed on Wednesday, as poor weather including two typhoons kept consumers away from stores and restaurants.
Retail sales edged down 0.2 percent in October compared with the same month last year, led by weak sales of food and beverages, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said.
The result matched the median forecast of economists polled by Reuters and marked the first decline since October last year. 
October's fall in retail sales follows a rare decline in overall private consumption in the July-September quarter, but economists see the downturn as temporary due to one-off factors.
Consumer confidence is at four-year highs, emboldened by an economy that has grown for seven straight quarters - its longest expansion in 16 years - while expectations are growing for bigger increases in wages.
""Basically the recovery trend is continuing,"" Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said of consumer spending, noting that high stock prices were one factor that would encourage consumption.
October retail sales were also hurt by having one less Saturday on the calendar than the same month last year.
Sales of food and beverages fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier, the first drop in eight months. 
Machinery and equipment sales slipped 0.9 percent on weaker sales of smartphones and computers, with some consumers holding off purchases ahead of smartphone launches in November, a ministry official said.
At large-scale retailers - department stores and supermarkets - sales fell 0.7 percent from a year earlier after adjustment for change in the number of stores.
In the plus column, fuel sales jumped 6.0 percent as energy prices rose, while automobile sales gained 3.2 percent for their 15th straight month of rises, benefiting from new model roll-outs.
Wednesday's retail sales report is the first piece of major consumption data for the current quarter, and kicks off a busy slate of October indicators over the coming days.
Also on the consumer spending front, household spending, due on Friday, is expected to have slipped. But the jobless rate is forecast to have held at a 23-year low, and the government hopes the tight labor market will soon lead to higher wages and bolster consumption.

""Given that household incomes are growing at a healthy pace and consumers are in high spirits, we are confident that consumer spending will rebound before long,"" Marcel Thielant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",UK shop prices slip 0.1 percent in November for third month running: BRC,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shop prices edged down by an annual 0.1 percent for the third month in a row during November, according to a survey that chimed with the Bank of England's thinking that inflation may have peaked around now.
Although prices for non-food goods declined at the slowest rate since May 2013, food price inflation cooled this month, Retail Consortium (BRC) and market research firm Nielsen said.
Still, the 0.1 percent drop in overall shop prices matched the shallowest rate of shop price deflation for the last four years. 
After raising interest rates for the first time in 10 years earlier this month, the Bank of England said it thought consumer price inflation - pushed up by the pound's fall after last year's Brexit vote - had probably peaked around now.
Although inflation looks set to run above the BoE's 2 percent target for the next few years, most economists say they do not expect the BoE to raise rates again until 2019.
""Many inflationary increases are still being absorbed by retailers and are not being passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen.
Price pressures among non-food retailers had been higher than for food vendors, the BRC said, reflecting the expiration of currency hedging contracts that had allowed them to protect customers from the inflationary effect of sterling's plunge last year.

The official measure of consumer price inflation unexpectedly held steady at 3.0 percent in October.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence near 17-year high; goods trade deficit widens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S consumer confidence surged to a near 17-year high in November, driven by a robust labor market, while house prices rose sharply in September, which should underpin consumer spending and boost economic growth.
The near-term growth outlook was, however, marred by other data on Tuesday showing a big rise in the goods trade deficit in October and a drop in inventory accumulation. The wider goods trade gap and weak inventory investment prompted economists to slash their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates.
""This economy has really got some legs if this confidence of consumers is to believed,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 3.3 points to a reading of 129.5 this month, within striking distance of 132.6, which was touched in November 2000. The strong confidence reading largely reflected households' upbeat perceptions of the labor market.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the best in more than 16 years. This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with further absorption of labor market slack. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The share of consumers expecting more jobs in the months ahead increased to 22.6 percent this month from 18.7 percent in October. 
The proportion of those anticipating fewer jobs fell to 11 percent in November from 11.6 percent the prior month. More consumers said they planned to buy houses and major appliances over the next six months.  
Confidence is also being buoyed by a resurgent stock market amid expectations that President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress will push through hefty corporate tax cuts. Congressional Republicans have unveiled a broad package of tax cuts, including slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.
BULLISH CONSUMERS
Economists said bullish consumers, together with the tightening labor market, were compelling reasons for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates next month despite worries about persistently low inflation. The U.S. central bank has raised rates twice this year. 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were little changed. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average hitting record highs.
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of house prices in 20 metropolitan areas jumped 6.2 percent in September on a year-over-year basis after increasing 5.8 percent in August.
A dearth of homes for sale and strong demand are pushing up house prices. While rising house prices are boosting equity for homeowners, the chronic shortage of properties is constraining home sales. The combination of rising consumer confidence and house prices bodes well for consumer spending.
""Confidence isn't a perfect gauge for consumer spending, but having the strongest confidence level in nearly two decades certainly helps,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit jumped 6.5 percent to $68.3 billion in October, boosted by rising imports of industrial supplies, consumer and other goods. Exports fell 1.0 percent as shipments of food, motor vehicles, capital and consumer goods decreased. 
The department also reported that wholesale inventories fell 0.4 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in September. Retail inventories slipped 0.1 percent in October after declining 0.9 percent the prior month. 
""Early in our fourth-quarter tracking, we think that both trade and inventories could be meaningful drags on growth during the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers slashed its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) cut its GDP forecast to a 2.3 percent pace from a 2.8 percent rate.

Trade added four-tenths of a percentage point to the economy's 3.0 percent growth rate in the third quarter while inventory investment contributed 0.73 percentage point.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence unexpectedly rose to 129.5 this month from a reading of 126.2 (revised up from an initial 125.9) in October. That was its fifth consecutive month of gains and the highest level since November 2000.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 124.0 in November.
Additionally, the Present Situation Index increased from 152.0 to 153.9, while the Expectations Index rose from 109.0 last month to 113.3.
“Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved moderately, while their expectations regarding the short-term outlook improved more so, driven primarily by optimism of further improvements in the labor market,” Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
“Consumers are entering the holiday season in very high spirits and foresee the economy expanding at a healthy pace into the early months of 2018,” she added.
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was November 14.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with the Richmond manufacturing index for the same month, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1882 from around 1.1885 ahead of the publication; GBP/USD was at 1.3262 from 1.3270 earlier; while USD/JPY was at 111.42 from 111.32 earlier.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 06:50AM ET</span>",Indian economic growth set to end five-quarter slide: Reuters poll,"By Shaloo Shrivastava
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian economic growth likely rebounded in the July-September quarter from the slowest growth in three years, with demand picking up modestly as the effects from a shock ban on high-value currency notes eased, a Reuters poll showed.
If that's correct, the data will be the latest evidence of a broad-based global economic upturn across Asia and most of the world that has many major central banks poised to move away from ultra-easy monetary policy. 
India was the world's fastest-growing major economy in 2016. But already-slowing growth was made weaker by the surprise cash clampdown late in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has hurt consumer spending ever since.
In July, the government introduced a goods and services tax that made sweeping changes to the way businesses across Asia's third largest economy charge taxes, delivering another blow to the economy.
But the Reuters poll of 52 economists over the past week showed gross domestic product growth likely rose to 6.4 percent from a year ago in the July-September quarter, from 5.7 percent in the previous period.
If the data, due to be released on 1200 GMT on Nov. 30, matches expectations, it will break a five-quarter slowing trend and mark the best rate this calendar year. Forecasts in the poll ranged from 5.9 percent to 6.8 percent.
""India's GDP growth is expected to rebound, albeit at a slower pace, due to supply disruptions stemming from the goods and services tax,"" wrote Shashank Mendiratta, economist at ANZ, who is forecasting a 6.2 percent pace.
""However, growth was probably cushioned by festive demand, and an uptick in industrial production,"" he said, referring to the national holiday of Diwali in mid-October, before which there is usually a surge in spending.
Since mid-year, sales of two-wheel and commercial vehicles, oil consumption, cargo traffic and rail freight have all increased and raised hopes that the impact of the cash squeeze has bottomed out.
Industrial and manufacturing activity as measured by business surveys has also improved in recent months. And Mumbai's BSE Sensex (BSESN) index of leading shares hit a record high earlier this month. 
Indeed, none of the 52 economists in the poll expected growth to slow from 5.7 percent. But for now, few economists expect a return to growth rates above 8 percent clocked at the start of 2016.
The Reuters poll also showed India's gross value-added (GVA) growth estimate likely accelerated to 6.2 percent, from 5.6 percent.
Annual consumer inflation hit a seven-month high of 3.6 percent in October. Oil prices and those of other commodities have risen in recent months. 
The Reserve Bank of India, which cut the repo rate in August, has little room to ease any further. In the meantime, the government announced a $32.43 billion plan to recapitalise its state banks over the next two years.
Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, who accurately predicted the surprise slowdown to 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, said that marked the trough in growth.

""The stimulus package from the government (has not had) any effect yet on economic activity in India. It will take some time,"" said Erken, who remains the most pessimistic forecaster, looking for 5.9 percent for July-September. But he expects a growth surge to above 8 percent in the current quarter.

(Reuters) - The number of new office developments in London is falling as higher construction costs and uncertainty over Brexit lead builders to delay new schemes, a closely-watched industry survey showed on Tuesday.
Construction began on 25 new central London office schemes in the six months ended Sept. 30, less than the 28 new construction projects started in the preceding six months, the London Office Crane Survey by Deloitte Real Estate showed.
The projects started over the surveyed period would add 1.8 million square feet into the development pipeline, the lowest new amount in more than three years, the survey added.
Although demand for office space has held up fairly well since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, vacancy rates have begun creeping up, property prices have fallen and business have grown more cautious on investment.
""Developers in central London continue to take stock of the current market dynamics, recognizing a number of disrupting factors such as costs, Brexit uncertainty and the pace of workplace change,"" Shaun Dawson, head of insight at Deloitte Real Estate, said.
He said developers were showing ""some caution on where and when to deliver"" London office projects.
 Land Securities  (L:LAND), the developer of a large chunk of London's offices over the past decade including the famed Walkie Talkie tower, said this month the slow pace of Brexit talks and uncertainty over the eventual outcome were leading to caution in the market.
The potential exodus of finance companies, major users of London offices, could further hurt market prospects.
A Reuters survey found that around 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years. The Deloitte survey showed that of the space under construction, 45 percent had been pre-leased by finance firms and 2 percent by insurers.

The survey also said construction costs were likely to rise over the coming year, as it forecast a slower pace of workload and an increase in the price of building materials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly rose in October to hit a 10-year high amid robust demand across the country, offering a boost to the housing market.
The upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Monday was the latest indication that housing was regaining momentum after treading water for much of the year because of a dearth of homes for sale and shortages of labor and suitable land for building. It underscored the economy's strength early in the fourth quarter.
""New home sales are a leading indicator and the jump in October sales are leading the economy higher as we finish out the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""You have to be very confident to make the biggest big-ticket purchase of your life."" 
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 units in October, the highest level since October 2007. September's sales pace was revised down to 645,000 units from the previously reported 667,000 units.
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for 11 percent of overall home sales, falling 6.0 percent to a pace of 625,000 units last month. Sales surged 18.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in October. 
New home sales, which have now increased for three straight months, added to strong homebuilding and existing home sales data in painting a positive picture of the housing market after it appeared to stall this year. 
Activity was also temporarily restrained by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Housing has been a drag on economic growth since the second quarter. There are concerns that an effort by Republicans in the U.S. Congress to overhaul the tax code could undermine the housing market.
Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed allowing interest payment deductions on mortgage debt only up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. Their colleagues in the Senate want to keep the existing limit at $1 million but eliminate the deduction of interest on home-equity loans 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower as shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), declined 1.1 percent and Pultegroup (N:PHM) fell 0.90 percent.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose marginally.
MILD WEATHER BOOST 
Some economists said mild weather helped to boost new home sales last month. Sales soared 30.2 percent in the Northeast to their highest level since October 2007. They rose 1.3 percent in the South also to a 10-year high. Sales jumped 17.9 percent in the Midwest and climbed 6.4 percent in the West.
""Sales rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest, which are the smallest regions for new home sales and often greatly influenced by atypical swings in the weather,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
More than two-thirds of the new homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be started. The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.4 percent to 282,000 units, the highest level since May 2009. 
Houses under construction or yet to be started accounted for about 77 percent of the inventory last month.
At October's brisk sales pace it would take 4.9 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the fewest since July 2016 and down from 5.2 months in September. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
""The market is starving for affordable new homes, and builders cannot and will not ignore this hungry market,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. 

""Land, labor and lumber prices are only expected to keep rising, which will force those builders looking to meet market demand to search for less expensive development options farther away from urban job cores.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in November likely slid 0.2 percent from the same month in 2016 despite high discounts to consumers as automakers have sought to clear out record levels of unsold 2017 model vehicles, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.
""The need to clear out record inventories of prior model-year vehicles continues to keep incentive spending aggressive in November,"" Thomas King, J.D. Power's senior vice president of data and analytics, said in a release accompanying the consultants' sales predictions.
New 2018 model-year vehicles have accounted for 44 percent of month-to-date sales, compared with November 2016 when the then-new 2017 model-year vehicles made up 53 percent of sales.
November U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.374 million units, a drop of 0.2 percent from 1.377 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 16 selling days of November. Automakers will release U.S. sales results for the month on Dec. 1.
Despite the minor dip in new vehicle sales, LMC raised its full-year 2017 forecast to 17.2 million units, from a previous estimate of 17.1 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for November will be 17.3 million vehicles, down nearly 2 percent from 17.6 million units in the same month in 2016, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were also set to decline 0.1 percent in November. 
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy.
The average discount per vehicle in November hit $4,065, just short of an all-time record in September of $4,091.
Discounts hit 10.8 percent of the manufacturer's recommended sales prices. Experts believe that anything above 10 percent hurts vehicle resale values and is ultimately unhealthy for the industry. 
The consultancies noted that discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 16 of the last 17 months.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 11:35PM ET</span>","China's industrial profits surge in October, take sting off government debt crackdown","Beijing (Reuters) - China's industrial firms weathered a broad government crackdown on financial risks as profits continued to surge last month in a stabilizing force for the world's second-biggest economy, which has started to cool slightly in recent months.
The vast industrial sector has been boosted by a year-long, government-led construction spree, helping lift demand and prices for building materials and taking the edge off higher borrowing costs.
Indeed, mining and heavy industry contributed the biggest gains in October, propelling overall industrial profits by 25.1 percent year-on-year to 745.4 billion yuan ($112.94 billion), compared with a 27.7 percent jump in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
Despite the modest slowdown, October's growth rate was still the second-highest for a single month this year, and overall profits are on pace to easily top 2016's record 6.88 trillion yuan.
""Apart from very high growth of the coal sector, we have very decent growth in other sectors as well,"" said Iris Pang, greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.
""I think this growth will be sustainable, even though...we will have high base effect in coal and steel next year.""
The data covers large companies with annual revenue exceeding 20 million yuan from their main businesses.
PRICE IMPACT
More than half of the increase in profits in October came from mining, iron and steel smelting and processing, chemicals, and oil and natural gas extraction, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in an accompanying statement.
The closure of polluting plants and factories have fueled fears of supply shortages in the winter, lifting prices of finished goods including steel and copper products.
The high-price trend has persisted, with domestic iron ore futures prices up over 15 percent since the start of November, while coking coal has risen over 23 percent.
Data earlier in the month showed China's factory prices continued to post strong gains as capacity cuts and anti-pollution measures kept supply in check.
Factory activity, however, has cooled in the past few months. A batch of October data including industrial output, investment and retail sales also undershot expectations, as Beijing's crackdown on financial risks raised borrowing costs, while the tighter pollution rules have shut many factories and mines.
These factors have started to drag on Asia's economic powerhouse, which has defied market expectations with growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.
Curbs on the property market to fend off speculators are also expected to persist, putting a lid on a range of sectors including construction.
BALANCE SHEET CHALLENGE
Despite the government's focus on reducing corporate leverage, the asset to liability ratio has remained unchanged at 55.7 percent for the last three months, indicating efforts to improve balance sheets at Chinese firms may have stagnated.
Growth in liabilities has also picked up this year. At the end of October, industrial firms' liabilities were 6.7 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with a 6.7 percent increase as of the end of September and 6.3 percent growth for 2016.
Indeed, a Reuters analysis of listed firms shows the debt pile at Chinese corporates continues to climb, with levels at the end of September growing at the fastest pace in four years.
China's stock markets were down in Monday morning trading, as jitters over an effort to improve oversight in the financial industry pulled down companies in the sector, led by a 1.64 percent decline in the Shanghai Stock Exchange's banking index.
In the first 10 months, industrial firms notched up profits of 6.25 trillion yuan, up 23.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 22.8 percent gain in January-September.
There was some moderation in profit growth for upstream industries, as mining profits rose 405.4 percent from a year earlier in January-October, compared to 473.8 percent growth in the first nine months of the year.
Profits earned by China's state-owned firms rose a sharp 48.7 percent to 1.41 trillion yuan in the first 10 months, compared to 47.6 percent in January-September.

""I don't think industrial profits will be affected a lot. (Growth) will not be 20-something percent, but it can still be in the high teens,"" ING's Pang said.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 01:05PM ET</span>",Mexico economy shrinks for first time in nearly two years,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy contracted more than previously thought in the third quarter due to the impact from storms and quakes on the oil and tourism industries, the government said on Friday, adding to concerns that stalled NAFTA talks are hurting growth.
Third-quarter gross domestic product shrank by 0.3 percent compared with the previous quarter, the first contraction in almost two years. The economy grew 1.5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, the slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2013.
Mexican stocks (MXX) were down nearly 0.8 pct following the data.
Mexico was struck by devastating September earthquakes and hurricanes in August and September that affected the oil industry, denting economic activity.
""This deceleration is largely explained by a temporary and limited impact from the natural disasters,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Friday, citing the oil, education and tourism industries. 
The ministry added that impact appeared to have dissipated and that it was maintaining its 2017 economic growth forecast of 2.0 percent to 2.6 percent. 
However the central bank is less optimistic, trimming its growth forecast for 2017 to between 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent this week due to the natural disasters and the impact on investment from worries about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA if the treaty is not reworked to better serve U.S. interests, spooking investors and prompting Mexico to try to diversify its trade.
NAFTA and Mexico's 2018 presidential election are likely to continue hitting activity as ""important investment decisions may be postponed, scaled down or even canceled, particularly in export-oriented sectors,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said on Friday.
Ramos said the uncertain terms under which Mexican exporters will have access to the U.S. market make it harder for companies to put money into Mexico at the moment.
A lack of progress in talks, increasingly stringent demands from the United States and the tight timeline set by negotiators make it increasingly likely that NAFTA will collapse, BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group, said on Friday in a client note.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to to 54.6 in November, from the prior reading of 55.2.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
By sectors, the research group said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) decreased to 54.7 in November, also a four-month low, from the prior month’s reading of 55.3.
Analysts had expected the reading to rise to 55.6.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
IHS Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) declined to 53.8 in November, a two-month low, from the prior month’s final reading of 54.6.
Economists had estimated that it would rise to 55.6.
“U.S. businesses reported another month of solid growth in November, putting the economy on course for a reasonable, though by no means stellar, fourth quarter,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
He specified that the readings suggested GDP growth of about 2%.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1917 from around 1.1914 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3353 from 1.3346 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 111.37 compared to 111.38 before the release.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 92.72 compared to 92.73 before the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stocks were trading higher after the open. The Dow 30 gained 39 points or 0.16%, the S&P 500 rose 5 points, or 0.18%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 11 points, or 0.15%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,289.59 a troy ounce, compared to $1,290.40 ahead of the data, while U.S. crude oil changed hands at $58.70, compared to $58.76 earlier."
1100,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 08:35AM ET</span>",Businesses look bullish about the road ahead,"By Jussi Rosendahl
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Businesses are heading into 2018 in a pretty optimistic mood, surveys will more than likely show in the coming week, pointing to a potential boost for already solid growth in the world's biggest economies.
Preliminary readings of plans being made by purchasing managers -- the executives who buy what their companies need -- have already painted a bullish picture for the euro zone and especially for its two biggest economies, Germany and France. 
IHS Markit's flash Purchase Managers' Index (PMI) for euro zone manufacturers climbed to 60.0 this month, well ahead of 58.3 in Reuters poll, marking the second-highest reading since the index was first collected in 1997. Anything above 50 indicates expansion.
November PMI's for many other major economies are due next Friday.
""The mood in business is good at the moment... Industrial output is performing well,"" said Hanna Freystatter, head of the international and monetary economy division at Bank of Finland.
""Basically all major economies are pointing in good direction and exports are being supported by the broad-based global recovery."" 
PMI is seen as a good indicator of economic conditions and it is even preferred by some analysts to gross domestic product, which might be affected by poor seasonal adjustment and is prone to revisions.
In the United States -- which is ahead of Europe in the growth cycle -- the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) measure of factory activity is expected to come in at 58.5, slightly down from last month's 58.7.
But in September, the index touched its highest level since May 2004.
While hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida in the past months disrupted business, U.S. manufacturing is still seen being supported by a booming global economy as well as weaker U.S. dollar.
In China, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI stood flat at 51.0 last month, reflecting slowing GDP growth and indicating further modest improvement ahead.
A Chinese slowdown is one of the major risks to continued global growth, so a major change in this report could cause some concerns.
Some analysts have noted that the government's production curbs to reduce pollution have added to companies' cost pressures and may hamper industrial activity in the months ahead.
But China's economy has surprised markets so far this year with a growth of nearly 6.9 percent on the back of a renaissance in long-ailing ""smokestack"" industries such as steel.
""This growth is expected to slow down gradually to around 5 percent pace, which is only desirable as the growth at the moment is debt-driven,"" Freystatter from Bank of Finland said.
In Japan, Markit/Nikkei Manufacturing PMI has held up above the 50 threshold for 14 consecutive months, while British factories also reported good activity through the autumn.
ANY DAY NOW
Although business surveys show more inflationary pressure in the euro zone, that has not translated into prices, which has supported the European Central Bank's case for only gradual removal of stimulus.
The ECB opted last month to halve its asset purchases while extending them by nine months, arguing that inflation still needed support to rise towards its target of almost 2 percent.
It also kept the bond buys open-ended, although policymakers were far from unanimous on that decision.
""We're really in a situation where everyone is looking at inflation and thinking 'any day now',"" said ING economist Bert Colijn.
Flash inflation in November, due on Thursday, is expected to have speeded up to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent in the previous month, while prices excluding energy and food are seen increasing 1.1 percent, a similar pace as in October.
""Taking into account the strong growth and decreasing unemployment, we should of course start to see gradual price pressure. But there are many uncertainties related to this,"" Bank of Finland's Freystatter said.
Some policymakers have argued that globalization and technological changes have made value chains more international, making low inflation a global phenomenon and limiting central banks' ability to control prices in their own jurisdiction.
But some reckon expected wage growth in Germany is one factor that should boost price pressures in the bloc next year.

""Inflation will likely fall at the start of the year... but after that we will see a pickup, and I think that the market doesn't price that as yet,"" said ‎‎Morgan Stanley economist Daniele Antonucci.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence hit a record high in November putting Europe's largest economy on track for a boom, the Ifo economic institute said on Friday, allaying some concerns about political instability over forming a new government.
Ifo said 90 percent of responses to its monthly survey of some 7,000 firms came before the collapse late on Sunday of talks on forming a three-way coalition.
But the Nov 6 to Nov 23 survey period did come as questions were being raised about what kind of government would come.
The institute's chief delivered an upbeat outlook.
""The German economy is on track for a boom,"" Ifo president Clemens Fuest said in a statement, forecasting economic growth of 0.7 percent in the final quarter of this year after 0.8 percent in the July-September period.
The Munich-based institute said its business climate index rose to 117.5 from an upwardly revised reading of 116.8 in October. This was higher than a Reuters consensus forecast for a value of 116.6.
A business expectations reading surged to 111.0 from 109.2. The business confidence reading caps a positive batch of German economic data this week.
On Thursday, official data showed exports and rising business investments were the main drivers of growth in the third quarter, signaling that the robust upswing will extend well into next year.
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, released on the same day, also showed an economy firing on all cylinders as factories churned out goods at the fastest pace in nearly seven years in November. 
UNCERTAINTY
Overshadowing the strong numbers is political uncertainty after conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to form a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the ecologist Greens.
But easing that somewhat, a senior member of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) said early on Friday they are ready to hold talks with other parties on breaking political deadlock.
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is trying to broker a deal, is keenly aware the source of Germany's international clout is its economic power and that businesses want a stable coalition soon to end the uncertainty and avoid another poll.
Steinmeier met SPD leader Martin Schulz for talks on Thursday and will meet parliamentary party leaders next week as he pushes political leaders to forge a deal and avoid new elections.
""Looking ahead, filled order books and low inventories should keep the manufacturing sector an important growth engine,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
""However, the fiscal stimulus which we had previously expected, will now clearly be delayed – though not aborted - due to the political impasse in Berlin,"" he added.

In a sign of the economy's robust health, engineering group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) on Thursday reported its highest annual order intake in five years.

Analysts had expected mortgage approvals to fall to just 40.9 thousand last month. 
Meanwhile, many homeowners rushed to refinance their mortgages ahead of the Bank of England's rate rise last month, the association said. 
""The anticipated bank rate rise saw a flurry of remortgage activity as many homeowners took advantage of the competitive rates on offer,"" said UK Finance’s Senior Economist Mohammad Jamei.

In a report, the German research institute Ifo said its Business Climate Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 117.5 this month from a reading of 116.7 in October, beating forecasts for a drop to 116.6.
However, the Current Assessment Index unexpectedly decreased to 124.4 in November from 124.8 a month earlier. The reading missed expectations for a rise to 125.0.
The Business Expectations Index, which measures attitudes toward business prospects over the next six months, increased to 111.0 this month from the reading of 109.2 (revised from 109.1) in October. That was a positive surprise compared to estimates for the reading to decline to 108.9.
The monthly index is based on a survey of around 7,000 German firms in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail sectors.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1865 from around 1.1863 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8905 from 0.8902 earlier.

Industrial output probably rose 1.9 percent compared with September, when it fell 1.0 percent, according to the median forecast of 19 economists.
With exports getting a boost from solid global demand, production is likely to continue its recovery, economists say.
""Output is expected to show a steady rising trend,"" said survey respondent Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life.
""Views will likely grow that there is a high possibility of output also rising for the October-December quarter,"" he said.
The trade ministry will announce the factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday Japan time (2350 GMT Wednesday).
The core consumer price index, which excludes the volatile prices of fresh food but includes energy costs, is likely to have risen 0.8 percent year-on-year in October, the poll showed, after a 0.7 percent rise in September.
That would mark the 10th straight month of increases in the government's key gauge of inflation, though it remain at less than half of the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
The BOJ is hoping a tight job market will push up incomes, and subsequently inflation, but energy continues to be a key driver of prices. In September, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent after stripping out energy costs.
Highlighting the tightness of the labor market, the jobless rate is expected to have held steady at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in October, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio was forecast at 1.53, a level last seen in 1974, the poll found.
Elsewhere, household spending is expected to have slipped 0.4 percent in October from a year earlier, dampened by a streak of bad weather including two typhoons. Similarly, October retail sales are forecast to have edged down 0.2 percent on the year.
The internal affairs ministry will publish the data on consumer prices, the job market and household spending at 8:30 a.m. on Friday (2330 GMT on Thursday). 
Retail sales for October data is due out at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in November on a seasonally adjusted basis from a final reading of 52.8 in October.
The reading remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 15th consecutive month and marked the fastest expansion since March 2014.
""New orders increased strongly, underpinned by business
from abroad amid recent yen weakness,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""New export orders expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years.""
The flash index for new export orders rose to 54.5 from a final 52.3 in the previous month to reach the highest since December 2013, helped by recent weakness in the yen.
The index for total new domestic and export orders jumped to the highest since March 2014.
The output component of the PMI index also rose to the highest since March 2014.
Input prices rose at a much faster pace than October, fueled by higher material prices and the cheaper yen, but the survey suggested manufacturers were only able to pass on a small portion of the hefty cost rises to their customers.
Japan's economy grew in the third quarter to post the longest streak of uninterrupted growth in more than a decade.

Most of the growth in the third quarter came from exports as consumer spending fell and capital expenditure slowed. However, economists say consumption and business investment will start to accelerate soon and expect domestic demand to drive growth in the future.

A consumer confidence index produced by polling firm YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, sank to 106.6 in November, down sharply from 109.3 in October.
It was the first fall since June although it remained above the 100 level above which consumers are considered to be feeling confident.
All eight of the index's underlying measures weakened and a score for household finances over the past 30 days sank to its lowest level since January 2014.
Christian Jaccarini, an economist at Cebr, linked the fall to factors including the first interest rate hike by the Bank of England in over a decade and a slowdown in the housing market.
""With these economic headwinds set to persist, and the OBR forecasting weaker growth, households are understandably worried,"" Jaccarini said, referring to a sharp cut to Britain's economic growth outlook by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's fiscal watchdog, on Wednesday.
British finance minister Philip Hammond announced measures to help the housing market in his budget statement also on Wednesday.

The survey was conducted between Nov. 1 and Nov. 21 and was based on responses from 5,673 people.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2017 08:43AM ET</span>",ECB split over keeping bond buys open-ended: minutes,"By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed last month on extending their asset purchase scheme but a decision to keep the bond buys open-ended appeared to generate fiercer debate, minutes of the meeting released on Thursday showed.
Having to reconcile rapid economic growth with anemic inflation, the ECB opted last month to halve its asset purchases while extending them by nine months, hoping that gentler though longer stimulus would still keep growth strong enough to generate inflation.
But minutes of the debate at the Oct. 26 policy meeting suggest policymakers were far from unanimous, with some keen to signal a clear end to the ECB's lavish asset purchases and others arguing for a change in emphasis as a precursor to their eventual end. The euro zone's central bank already has over 2.2 trillion euros worth of assets on its balance sheet.
While the nine-month extension of the scheme at 30 billion euros per month enjoyed broad support, policymakers discussed a range of alternatives, debated an eventual change in the bank's guidance, and agreed that other components of central bank stimulus should also be highlighted, the minutes showed.
""An end date was viewed (by a few) to be well justified in anticipation of further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation on the basis of the better than expected growth momentum, diminishing risks and continued favorable financing conditions for the real economy,"" the minutes said.
""Some concerns were also expressed that the open-ended nature of the asset purchase program might generate expectations of further extensions.""
The dissenters argued that even if markets did not anticipate a clear end date, the reaction would be limited and in any case, the economy was able to handle tighter financing conditions given the solid growth path.
In a further sign of diverging views, some policymakers argued that the ECB should stop linking its asset buys to the path of inflation and should instead reference to its overall monetary policy stance.
Sources have previously told Reuters that policymakers were in general agreement that barring shocks, the asset buys would end next year.
In a possible preparation for this end, policymakers expressed a desire to highlight other parts of ECB support, particularly a sizable balance sheet, low rates and a promise to keep rates low for an extended period, the minutes showed.
The debate highlights the split in the Governing Council and suggests that any further extension of the asset purchase scheme would run into opposition, even if inflation will miss the ECB's target of almost 2 percent for years to come.
The ECB's problem is that while the euro zone economy has expanded for 18 consecutive quarters, its best run in a decade, inflation has undershot the bank's target for five years, threatening the ECB's credibility since inflation is its primary mandate.
But much of the bank's policy firepower is already exhausted after 2.2 trillion euros worth of bond buys so the ECB is under pressure to shift to lighter but more protracted stimulus, giving itself even more time to raise inflation.

Its biggest puzzle is that while unemployment is falling quickly, wages are not responding, throwing into doubt a long-standing relationship between the two indicators. Other regions, including the United States, are facing a similar dilemma.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth is roaring ahead as the year draws to a close, surveys showed on Thursday, supporting the European Central Bank's move last month to announce a throttling back of its monetary stimulus.
Surveys covering both the services and manufacturing industries outshone even the most optimistic forecasters in Reuters polls -- indicating growth is broad-based - with factories having the second-best month in the index's history.
An earlier sister survey from Germany showed Europe's largest economy shifted into an even higher gear in November as factories churned out goods at the fastest pace in nearly seven years. [nL9N1MA02F]
France's equivalent confounded economists' expectations for a slowdown and activity grew at the fastest pace in 6-1/2 years this month as recent labor reforms pushed firms to add staff quicker than at any time since 2001. [nL9N1MA02E]
The currency bloc has emerged as the surprise economic star of 2017, with growth rates outpacing its peers, and future-looking indicators in the latest Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) suggest the upturn still has momentum.
IHS Markit's composite flash PMI for the euro zone jumped to 57.5 this month, its highest since April 2011 and smashing the median forecast in a Reuters poll for no change from a final October reading of 56.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""All in all, there are no signs of stopping the euro zone economy at the moment and 2018 is likely to start on a strong footing,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""With continued monetary support and some expected improvements in global growth in 2018, the euro zone economy is set for another year of surprising growth.""
December looks like it will be busy, too. A new business index rose to 56.9 from 56.6, a near seven-year high and so IHS Markit said the PMI, if maintained, points to fourth quarter growth of 0.8 percent, outstripping the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month. [ECILT/EU]
Britain's overall economic growth sped up moderately in the third quarter but was only a tepid 0.4 percent, official figures showed on Thursday, as households increased the pace of spending but business investment grew more slowly, suggesting caution among companies ahead of Brexit. [nUKLNMED0H]

Accelerating growth in the euro zone, alongside increasing price pressures, will be welcomed by policymakers at the ECB who last month took a step towards weaning the euro zone off loose money. [nL8N1N132C]
""Today's data make it easy for the ECB to justify its forced reduction of the bond buying program in 2018,"" said Christoph Weil at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry also beat all expectations in a Reuters poll, rising from October's 55.0 to a six-month high of 56.2 and comfortably above the median forecast for a very modest increase to 55.1.
Implying a busy end to the year, service firms built up backlogs of work at the fastest rate since May 2011, with the sub-index up from 52.9 to 53.3, pushing them to increase headcount at the fastest rate in almost 10 years.
Manufacturers also had a much better month than anyone polled expected. Their PMI climbed to 60.0 from 58.5, the second-highest reading since the index was first collected in June 1997 and only surpassed in April 2000.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to a near seven-year high of 60.8 from 58.8.
With new orders coming in at the fastest rate since April 2011, factories built up backlogs of work and stockpiled raw materials.
Yet despite jacking up employment at the fastest rate in the survey's more than 20-year history, with the subindex rising to 57.9 from 57.3, delivery times grew.
""The increasing backlogs of work are a positive indication for investment growth in the months ahead, which suggests that the euro zone economy is likely to continue to fire on all cylinders,"" Colijn said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy remained reliant on spending by households, despite the squeeze on their finances, while business investment grew slowly, suggesting caution among companies ahead of Brexit, official data for the third quarter showed.
Britain's overall economic growth sped up moderately in the third quarter to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, confirming a preliminary reading.
The breakdown of the data showed spending by households drove the economy once again even as they suffered a hit to their incomes from slow wage growth and a jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, prompting a rise in borrowing.
On Wednesday, Britain's budget watchdog took an axe to its economic growth forecasts for every year into the early part of the next decade as it chopped its projections for productivity growth, the Achilles heel of the economy. [nL8N1NS25X]
In annual terms, Thursday's data showed the economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter, unchanged from the second quarter but the joint weakest growth in more than five years.
""The UK economy owes everything to the over-stretched consumer,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at money transfer company WorldFirst.
Howard Archer, an economist at EY Item Club, a forecasting firm, said the squeeze on consumers should ease in 2018 when inflation is expected to fall back, but that uncertainties about Brexit were likely to weigh further on business investment.
Household spending grew at a quarterly rate of 0.6 percent, up from 0.2 percent in the second quarter, to show the fastest increase in a year, despite the income squeeze, the ONS said.
The ONS said spending on transport rose, helped by a recovery in car sales which had been weak in the second quarter after a tax increase.
But businesses upped their investment by only 0.2 percent in the three months to September, the weakest pace so far in 2017.
The ONS also said Britain's trade deficit weighed on the economy, despite the fall the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have said would give a boost to exporters.

The Bank of England, which raised interest rates for the first time in a decade earlier this month, hopes that stronger growth among manufacturers will bolster the economy as it faces the challenge of Brexit.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Exports and rising business investments were the main drivers of growth for the German economy in the third quarter, data showed on Thursday, signaling that the robust upswing in Europe's largest economy will extend well into next year.
This should allay concerns about risks for the economy linked to Chancellor Angela Merkel's failure to form a coalition government after an election in September, which raised the possibility of a second vote that could boost the far-right.
Detailed gross domestic product (GDP) data showed that exports rose 1.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose 0.9 percent, which translated in net trade contributing half of the quarterly growth reading of 0.8 percent.
Business investments in machinery and equipment were up by 1.5 percent, contributing 0.1 percentage points to growth. Household spending fell by 0.1 percent and state expenditure was flat.
The figures highlight the resurgence of exports as a driver of growth in an economy that has been relying mainly on private consumption and state spending for a growth cycle also supported by a booming construction sector and low interest rates.
""In the short term, the impact from the current political impasse on the German economy should be (close to) zero,"" ING Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said. 
""The economy has plenty of positive momentum and the external environment, including low-interest rates and the weak euro, remains favorable enough to shield the economy against political uncertainty,"" he said.
UPSWING TO CONTINUE
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, released Thursday, also illustrated an economy firing on all cylinders as factories churned out goods at the fastest pace in nearly seven years in November.
""In the late stage of a growth cycle, rebounding investments are an elixir for survival: only through investments can the negative effects of multiplying bottlenecks in production and staff be alleviated,"" said Andreas Scheuerle of Deka Bank.
He added: ""If you take the first three quarters together, the German economy is in a glorious state.""
The growth data showed investment in construction was down 0.4 percent, resulting in the sector making no contribution to growth in the third quarter.
Economists said the fall in household spending was no reason for alarm. As companies increase investments to meet rising demand, including from a recovering euro zone, more jobs will be created, which bodes well for consumption.
""When investments pick up speed, the foundation for a self-supporting expansion is laid,"" said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank. ""This positive process is well underway in Germany. The upswing will continue robustly next year.""

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2017 03:32AM ET</span>",China's trade with North Korea sinks in October after U.N. sanctions,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade with North Korea fell to $334.9 million in October, its lowest since February as imports sank to their weakest in years, data showed on Thursday, the latest sign that tough new sanctions cut business with its isolated neighbor.
The total is down almost 20 percent from September and compares with $525.2 million a year ago, according to customs' data.
The data represents the first whole month since the latest United Nations penalties came into force on Sept. 5, banning Pyongyang from selling coal, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood abroad.
The world's second-largest economy bought goods worth $90.75 million from North Korea in October, down sharply from $145.8 million in September and the lowest on government records going back to January 2014, data from China's General Administration of Customs shows.
Exports plunged to $244.2 million, the weakest since February. That compares with $266.4 million in September and $286.9 million in October last year.
Trade between the two countries has slowed this year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.
But the pace and scale of the drop suggest the most recent curbs are hurting Pyongyang's ability to sell some critical commodities to one of its chief trading partners.
The U.N. estimated the latest ban, imposed after its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, would slash by North Korea's $3-billion annual export revenue by a third.
The data is also likely to underscore Beijing's strongly-stated stance that it is rigorously enforcing U.N. resolutions aimed at reining in Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.
The data comes as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang, with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions.
A more detailed breakdown by commodity will be released on Friday.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2017 02:10PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers say rate increase likely warranted soon: minutes,"By Jason Lange and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Many Federal Reserve policymakers expect that interest rates will have to be raised in the ""near term,"" according to the minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting released on Wednesday.
The readout from the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting, at which the Fed kept rates unchanged, also showed policymakers generally agreed the economy was poised for strong growth. Several Fed officials also saw improved chances that the U.S. Congress would pass significant tax cuts that would boost business investment.
While some policymakers said they still needed to see more data before deciding the timing of a rate hike, many of the officials said the jobless rate appeared to be too low for inflation to remain at its current weak level.
""Participants expected solid growth in consumer spending in the near term, supported by ongoing strength in the labor market,"" the Fed said in the minutes. ""Many participants thought that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted in the near term.""
The central bank has increased rates four times in a tightening cycle that began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three more hikes in 2018.
The meeting marked one of the last policy reviews to be attended by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who announced on Monday she would resign from her seat on the Fed's Board of Governors once Jerome Powell is confirmed and sworn in to replace her as head of the central bank. 
President Donald Trump nominated Powell, who is expected to be in place when Yellen's four-year term as Fed chief ends in February.
In the minutes, policymakers engaged in what has become a regular debate over why inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target for several years. Most agreed that tightness in the labor market would likely fuel higher inflation in the medium term. 
Some of the members who vote on policy, however, expressed concern over the inflation outlook, according to the minutes. These policymakers emphasized they would be looking at upcoming economic data before deciding the timing of future rate rises. 

A couple of policymakers were concerned enough about persistently weak price gains that they suggested the Fed consider a new framework in which it committed to allowing higher inflation to make up for periods of low price rises.
Since the last policy meeting, Yellen has stuck by her prediction that inflation will soon rebound toward the Fed's target, although on Tuesday she said she is ""very uncertain"" about this and is open to the possibility that prices could remain low for years to come.

The details of the meeting, at which the U.S. central bank voted to leave rates unchanged also showed that several Fed members said future rate increases would depend on data showing that the trend of sluggish inflation subsided.
""Several participants indicated that their decision about whether to increase the target range in the near term would depend importantly on whether the upcoming economic data boosted their confidence that inflation was headed toward the Committee’s objective,"" the minutes noted.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2017 11:39AM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders drop; business spending strong,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in October after three straight months of hefty gains, but a sustained increase in shipments pointed to robust business investment and economic momentum as the year winds down.
The economy's prospects were bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing a decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits. Strong business investment and tightening labor market conditions will likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates next month.
""Fed policymakers will likely be impressed with the positive overall trend of business investment in equipment this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Interest rates do not need to be left at such low levels if the goal is to further business investment.""
The Commerce Department on Wednesday said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month. That was the biggest drop since September 2016 and followed an upwardly revised 2.1 percent increase in September.
Orders of these so-called core capital goods increased at a 14.5 percent annualized pace in the three months prior to October, the strongest since June 2013. Economists had forecast orders of core capital goods increasing 0.5 percent last month after a previously reported 1.7 percent jump in September. Core capital goods orders rose 4.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods advanced 0.4 percent last month after accelerating by 1.2 percent in September, pushing the annualized three-month pace to 13.1 percent. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
""The solid trend for the shipments data through October suggests that the fourth quarter will be another strong quarter for equipment spending,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We see some upside risk to our real GDP growth forecast for the fourth quarter.""
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose marginally in thin trading ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed near record highs as a retreat in technology stocks was offset by a jump in crude prices.
Core capital goods shipments have been increasing since February, in part fueled by expectations that President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress will push through hefty corporate tax cuts.
Republicans in the House of Representatives last week approved a broad package of tax cuts, including an immediate reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Their colleagues in the Senate are advancing their own tax bill, which would also lower corporate taxes by the same rate but delay the reduction by one year.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET 
Business spending on equipment has buoyed economic growth for the past four quarters and is expected to make a solid contribution to GDP in the October-December period. The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 2.5 percent pace to as high as a 3.4 percent rate. 
""With the passage of a corporate tax cut becoming more possible, the likelihood is that future business capital spending should be strong,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Strong business spending on equipment is helping to boost manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Last month, there were increases in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, primary metals and computers and electronic products.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, fell 1.2 percent last month as demand for transportation equipment tumbled 4.3 percent. Durable goods orders increased 2.2 percent in September.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Nov. 18, reversing the prior week's increase. 
Claims had risen in recent weeks as a backlog of applications from Puerto Rico was processed following repairs to infrastructure damaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Last week marked the 142nd straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 239,750 last week. 
The claims data covered the survey period for the non-farm payrolls component of November's employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 8,750 between the October and November survey weeks, suggesting steady job growth this month.

The economy created 261,000 jobs in October, a large chunk of which reflected a recovery after workers in Texas and Florida were temporarily displaced by hurricanes. Non-farm payrolls increased by only 18,000 in September.

The revision of the data for November from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment ticked up to 98.5, from the initial reading of 97.8.
Analysts had forecast a smaller increase to 98.0.
The current conditions index was slipped less than expected to 113.5, from the prior 113.6. Analysts had expected it to fall to 113.3.
The consumer expectations component was unexpectedly revised upwards to 88.9. Economists had forecast it to remain unchanged at 87.6.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months decreased to 2.5%, from the prior 2.6%, while the five-year inflation expectations also moved lower to 2.4%, from 2.5%.
The survey center’s chief economist Richard Curtin noted that consumer sentiment narrowed its loss, although it remained slightly below last month’s decade peak.
“Overall, the Sentiment Index has remained largely unchanged since the start of the year at the highest levels since 2004,” Curtin said.
“In contrast to the media buzz about approaching cyclical peaks and an aging expansion, with the implication of greater uncertainty about future economic trends, consumers have voiced greater certainty about their expectations for income, employment, and inflation. Inflation expectations have shown the smallest dispersion on record, and increased certainty about future income and job prospects has become a key factor that has supported discretionary purchases,” this economist pointed out.
“To be sure, caution is warranted given that the current expansion will soon be the second longest expansion since the mid-1800s, as well as the potential for significant changes in tax policies and the new Fed leadership and Board members,” he warned.
Curtin concluded that the data suggested a 2.7% gain in real consumption expenditures for 2018 and “more importantly for retailers, the best runup to the holiday shopping season in a decade”.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2017 01:34PM ET</span>",U.S. homes sales accelerate; supply still a constraint,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October as hurricane-related disruptions eased, but a chronic shortage of houses which is pushing prices beyond the reach of some first-time buyers remains an obstacle.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units last month. The NAR said sales in Houston and Jacksonville, regions which bore the brunt of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, had rebounded. 
Sales in South Florida, however, remained weak last month.
The Realtors group said it expected activity in the areas affected by the storms to fully recover by the end of the year.
""While this summer's storms undoubtedly took some steam out of the housing market, the greater problem remains the general lack of inventory,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""People simply are not moving as much as they used to.""
Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales. They fell 0.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in October and remained well below a 10-year-high 5.70 million-unit pace touched in March. Economists had forecast home sales rising 0.7 percent from September to a 5.42 million-unit rate last month. 
October marked two straight months of increases. There are concerns that an effort by Republicans in the U.S. Congress to overhaul the tax code could undermine the housing market.
Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed allowing interest payment deductions on mortgage debt only up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. Their colleagues in the Senate want to keep the existing limit at $1 million but eliminate the deduction of interest on home-equity loans.
""We just hope the tax cut plans are not too radical and end up scaring the consumer and make the purchase of a new home even less affordable after taxes,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher in line with a broadly firmer stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
LIMITED BUYING OPTIONS 
The South, which accounts for almost half of the existing homes sales market, recorded a 1.9 percent increase in sales last month. There were also gains in sales in the Northeast, Midwest and West regions. 
Home sales remain constrained by an acute shortage of properties, which is exerting upward pressure on house prices, and sidelining some first-time buyers, who accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month. 
Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.
The number of previously owned homes on the market fell 3.2 percent to 1.80 million units in October, a seven-month low. Supply was down 10.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 29 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
At October's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.2 months in September. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
As a result, the median house price increased 5.5 percent from a year ago to $247,000 in October. That was the 68th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.9 percent since the 2007/09 recession ended.
""Roughly half of what's available to buy is priced in the upper one-third of home values, leaving scant options for those aging millennials and young families trying to get their foot in the door,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. 
Builders have failed to plug the inventory gap, citing land and labor shortages, as well as expensive raw materials. 
A report last week showed housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a 1.290 million-unit pace in October. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. 

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to bridge the inventory shortfall. Homes sold in October typically stayed on the market for 34 days, down from 41 days a year ago.

The industry data showed that home resales increased by 2.0% in October to a seasonally adjusted 5.48 million units from 5.39 million units in the previous month.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.7% rise to 5.42 million units in October.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
The report also showed that median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $247,000, up 5.5%from October 2016 ($234,100). October's price increase marks the 68th straight month of year-over-year gains.
“Existing-home sales increased in October to their strongest pace since earlier this summer, but continual supply shortages led to fewer closings on an annual basis for the second straight month,” the report indicated.
“Job growth in most of the country continues to carry on at a robust level and is starting to slowly push up wages, which is in turn giving households added assurance that now is a good time to buy a home,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun commented in the release.
“While the housing market gained a little more momentum last month, sales are still below year ago levels because low inventory is limiting choices for prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated,” he said.
Yun added that there were still residual effects on sales from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but that he expected sales to completely bounce back in Texas and Florida because demand was “very strong” before the storms.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1734 compared to 1.1731 before the release, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.3254, compared to 1.3251 before the data, while USD/JPY traded at 112.22 compared to 112.23 earlier.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2017 08:06AM ET</span>",Higher UK borrowing underscores budget headache for Hammond,"By William Schomberg and Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - British government borrowing unexpectedly grew last month, underscoring finance minister Philip Hammond's challenge as he weighs calls for more spending in his budget on Wednesday against the prospect of weaker economic growth ahead.
Hammond is under pressure to help embattled Prime Minister Theresa May in his new tax and spending plans, and he will not welcome some signs in Tuesday's data that the economic slowdown this year is being felt in government revenues, economists said.
The deficit, excluding state-run banks, stood at 8.0 billion pounds, up 6.9 percent compared with October 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
That contrasted with a median forecast that the shortfall would fall to 7.0 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
Rising debt costs, linked to Britain's higher inflation since the Brexit vote, were a driver of the shortfall while corporation tax revenues fell for a fourth month in a row and growth in value-added tax revenues slowed.
The figures contrasted with a recent run of better-than-expected readings of the public finances that still leave Hammond on track to beat his target for this year.
Borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is down by nearly 10 percent at 38.5 billion pounds.
Tuesday's data also showed the deficit for September had been revised down by nearly 1 billion pounds. 
But the challenge for Hammond further out looks like it is about to get tougher, limiting his room for maneuver.
""We expect tomorrow's budget to be generally cautious, incorporating a broadly neutral package of tax and spending changes,"" Paul Hollingsworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
Britain's official budget forecasters are expected to cut their forecasts for economic growth in the coming years because of the country's stubbornly weak productivity record. Weaker growth would mean lower tax revenues than previously thought.
Hammond was quoted as saying on Sunday that the government was heavily constrained fiscally, ""but we do have some room"" and he said he would seek to speed up house-building in his budget.
VOTER FATIGUE
Many voters say they are tired of seven years of spending cuts in many public services, a factor behind June's election result which cost Prime Minister May her parliamentary majority.
Britain has been struggling to fix its public finances since the budget deficit surged to around 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 in the wake of the global financial crisis.
Since then it has been cut steadily to 2.3 percent of GDP in the 2016/17 financial year which ended in March, its smallest since before the global financial crisis.
But public debt remains around double its level before the global financial crisis at almost 90 percent of GDP, including the Bank of England's economic stimulus programs.
Hammond has said he wants to balance the budget by the mid-2020s while at the same time keeping some room to allow him to spend more if needed to support the economy through Brexit.
As well as measures to boost house-building, Hammond is likely to announce the latest push to improve Britain's weak productivity, a challenge which has become more acute as exporters lose some of their access to EU export markets.
Employers group CBI said British factories have had their best month for orders in nearly 30 years in November, boosted by the fall in the value of sterling and by strong economic growth in Europe and beyond. [nL9N1M1010]

The Confederation of British Industry's industrial order book balance surged in November to +17 from -2 in October, marking its highest level since August 1988. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +3.
The survey's gauge of export orders also rocketed, hitting its highest level since June 1995.
The Bank of England hopes that exports by British manufacturers can partially offset lower spending by consumers at home who have been pinched by a rise in inflation following last year's fall in the value of the pound.
As well as weaker sterling, a rebound in growth in the euro zone and beyond has helped British factories. 
""UK manufacturers are once more performing strongly as global growth and the lower level of sterling continue to support demand. Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years,"" said Anna Leach, the CBIs' head of economic intelligence.
""Nonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong.""

Despite the strong reading for November, the CBI's gauge of factory output expectations for the next three months cooled to its lowest since October 2016.

Most of the workers employed as fruit pickers to dish washers knew they were earning well below Australia's minimum wage, the online survey of more than 4,000 people in 12 industries showed on Tuesday.
The people were on working-holiday or student visas and accounted for 11 percent of Australian jobs, mostly in restaurants and takeaways, petrol stations, car washes, farms, meatpacking, taxi-driving, factories, cleaning and child care.
""The study reveals that Australia has a large, silent under-class of migrant workers that are paid well below the minimum wage,"" said Bassina Farbenblum, a senior law lecturer at the University of New South Wales, who ran the survey with researchers at the University of Technology Sydney.
The survey drew attention to the widespread nature of the problem, in the wake of wage scandals involving 7-Eleven and Caltex Australia (AX:CTX) in the past two years, which led the government to step up fines for employers who underpay staff.
It also comes amid broader concerns among policy makers about Australia's tepid wages, with latest figures showing annual pay rates grew at a slow 2 percent in the third quarter.
In the minutes of its latest policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia warned of ""considerable uncertainty"" about how quickly wages growth and inflation might pickup.
The survey found that workers from Asian countries, including China, Taiwan and Vietnam, were paid less than workers from North America, Ireland and the UK.
""There's been a common misconception that they're underpaid because they simply don't know Australian labor laws, and that's really not the case at all,"" Farbenblum said.
Fruit and vegetable pickers were the worst paid. Growers rely on young people on working-holiday visas, who in turn can extend their visas to stay for a second year if they complete three months of work in the rural industry.
Around a third of fruit and vegetable pickers were paid A$10 ($7.50) an hour or less, and one out of seven were paid A$5 an hour or less, which was less than a quarter of the minimum wage for casual jobs at the time.
""It's really incredibly egregious,"" Farbenblum told Reuters.

The all-items CPI in October was forecast to have risen 0.5 percent, up from 0.4 percent in September, according to the median forecast of 10 economists in the poll.
""Private road transport costs is expected to rise due to higher Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices and an increase in petrol prices during the month,"" ANZ bank said in a research note to its clients.
A COE is a quota license won in an auction that allows the permit holders to own vehicles in the city-state.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Disappointing third-quarter growth figures, falling inflation and recent comments by central bank board members could mean a cut in Colombia's benchmark interest rate at a meeting on Friday, according to a Reuters survey of analysts.
The nation has faced the fallout from lower oil prices and domestic consumption, as well as once-high inflation figures that split the seven-member board's focus. 
Though 11 of 16 analysts estimate the monetary authority will hold the rate at 5 percent, the remaining five projected a cut of 25 basis points to 4.75 percent. 
The survey took place after the government reduced its gross domestic product growth target for 2017 to 1.8 percent after reporting a smaller-than-expected third-quarter expansion.
In a central bank poll of analysts conducted just prior to the GDP data, the forecast was that policymakers would hold the interest rate steady through year-end.
Bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria said on Friday that the growth figures were lower than hoped, while Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas, who represents the government on the board, said there remained space for cuts.
The board surprised the market in October by reducing borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 5 percent. Analysts had expected a hold.
""The GDP figures still show the economy needs more stimulation. If it's not lowered now, it could complicate the macroeconomic panorama due to an increase in rates by the (United States) Federal Reserve or negative news on an external level that might negatively impact emerging economies,"" said Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics in London.
This month board member Juan Pablo Zarate told Reuters that the growth projections justify a more expansive monetary policy.
Expectations for end of 2017 inflation were down to 3.9 percent from 4.09 percent in October's survey, just within the bank's 2 to 4 percent target range. It would be the first time in two years that the figure has fallen below 4 percent.
""Recent comment by board members point to inflationary risks diminishing and the production gap widening, which we think will lead the board to head toward expansionist territory before we previously anticipated,"" Sergio Olarte of BTG Pactual said.
Still, the majority of analysts thought the rate would remain unchanged.

""Strategically, the position for the close of the year should be neutral, with which the bank will reinforce its message of complying with the inflation target. That's why we expected an unaltered rate in November and December,"" said Daniel Escobar of Global Securities brokerage.

The quarterly National Manufacturing Barometer, conducted by business consultancies SWMAS and Economic Growth Solutions, chimed with other surveys showing strong manufacturing activity now, but a cautious approach to the future.
Only 40 percent of small- and medium-sized manufacturers said they expect to increase staff numbers in the next six months, down from 42 percent in the previous quarter and the weakest reading since records started in 2013.
Even though sales and profits had improved over the previous survey, investment intentions weakened a little in the latest quarter, the survey showed.
Forty-three percent of manufacturers said they expected to increase spending on machinery and buildings over the next six months, down from 44 percent in the previous survey and the weakest reading since early 2016.
Overall the report fitted with the idea that British manufacturers are in the middle of a temporary ""sweet spot"".
Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent used that phrase in March to describe a window in which producers could enjoy the benefits of a weaker currency, before the possible downsides of Brexit appear.
Monday's survey showed manufacturers were more likely to try to eke out productivity gains from their existing workforce and equipment rather than investing in new machinery and automation.
""Automation is key for us, but the more immediate priority focus should be our people. It's a quicker win,"" said Karen Friendship, managing director of metal fabricator Aldermans, one of the survey respondents.
The central challenge of finance minister Philip Hammond's budget on Wednesday will be to improve Britain's persistently weak productivity, which lags international rivals and is seen as a major limit to economic growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth held steady in October, suggesting that brisk global demand for Japanese cars and electronics will likely carry its economic recovery into the current quarter.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showed that exports rose 14.0 percent year-on-year in October, led by shipments of cars to Australia and liquid-crystal device production equipment and raw materials for plastics to China.
That compares with a 15.8 percent annual gain expected by economists following a 14.1 percent increase in September.
The trade figures followed data that showed last week Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the third quarter, driven by solid external demand.
Analysts expect exports will continue to drive growth in October-December as China is seen likely to avoid a sharp slowdown thanks to infrastructure investment, and as progress on tax cuts brightens prospects for the United States.
""Looking at the near term, demand for electronics parts used for new-model smartphones are expected to help Japan's exports,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""In the longer term, brisk demand for capital expenditure in advanced nations will support the global economy and Japan's exports as receding political uncertainty releases pent-up demand for upgrades of existing production facilities.""
In volume terms, Japan's exports rose 3.8 percent in October from a year ago, after a 4.8 percent annual gain in September.
The value of exports to the United States rose 7.1 percent in the year to October led by motors and construction and mining machinery, following an 11.1 percent gain in the previous month.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose an annual 11.3 percent in October to 644.7 billion yen ($5.75 billion), a source of concern given President Donald Trump's demand for bilateral trade talks to fix trade imbalances under his ""America First"" policy.
Monday's data marked the fourth straight month of annual growth in Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 26.0 percent year-on-year in October to 1.35 trillion yen, the highest value on record.
Japan's imports rose 18.9 percent in the year to October, versus the median estimate for a 20.2 percent annual increase. It was the fastest annual increase since January 2014, pushed up by a weak yen and imports of crude oil, oil products and coal.

The resulting trade balance was a surplus of 285.4 billion yen in October versus the median estimate for a positive balance of 330.0 billion yen, a fifth straight surplus month.

China's housing market has seen a near two-year boom, giving the economy a major boost but stirring fears of a property bubble, with the government taking strong measures to curtail purchases.
Authorities have been particularly focused on curbing speculative lending in the housing market and have continued a broad effort to defuse financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt in the economy.
Average new home prices rose 0.3 percent month-on-month in October, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in September, according to Reuters calculations from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data out on Saturday.
The number of cities surveyed that recorded monthly increases in prices increased in October, indicating broadening strength in markets nationwide.
New home prices rose 5.4 percent year-on-year in October, down from September's 6.3 percent increase as rapid increases subside in the face of government efforts to engineer a soft landing in the housing market.
Data on Monday showed household loans, mostly for property purchases, fell to 450.1 billion yuan in October from 734.9 billion yuan in September.
While monthly price rises peaked in September 2016 at 2.1 percent nationwide, they have softened only slowly, regaining momentum as buyers shrugged off each new measures to curb speculation.
Prices for new private homes in top-tier cities fell 0.1 percent in October, narrowing from a 0.2 percent decline in September, the NBS said in a note accompanying the data.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, prices fell 0.1 percent after being flat in September. They fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
Property values rose 0.2 percent on-month in Shanghai after remaining unchanged in September.
As mega-cities like Beijing impose increasingly stringent measures, speculators have moved to smaller centers this year where authorities offer cheap credit and impose few restrictions in the hope of clearing a glut of unsold homes.
Property prices in tier-3 cities rose 0.3 percent from a 0.2 percent increase in September, the NBS said in the note.
While market watchers do not anticipate significant price declines or a crash, weakness in property and construction is starting to drag on broader economic growth.
Gross domestic product growth eased to 6.8 percent last quarter from 6.9 percent in the first half, with a marked deceleration in the property sector.
Data on Tuesday showed property sales in October fell at the fastest rate in more than 2-1/2 years and housing starts slowed sharply, reinforcing views that China's robust growth is starting to cool.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported a monthly price increase for new homes. Fifty reported higher prices in October from 44 in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as disruptions caused by recent hurricanes in the South faded and communities in the region started replacing houses damaged by flooding.
The sharp rebound in home construction reported by the Commerce Department on Friday was also driven by robust gains in the Northeast and Midwest regions.
The broad recovery could ease concerns about the housing market, which has been a drag on economic growth since the second quarter. The report added to labor market, manufacturing and retail sales data that have pointed to strong economic momentum as the year winds down.
""Homebuilders are building and that signals greater confidence in the economy ahead,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Housing construction has been the missing link in the puzzle over why investment spending has lagged in this recovery.""
Housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That was the highest level since October 2016 and also the second-best reading in 10 years. September's sales pace was revised up to 1.135 million units from the previously reported 1.127 million units.
Groundbreaking activity in the South, which accounts for almost half of U.S. residential construction, plummeted in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The storms slammed Texas and Florida in late August and early September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.185 million units last month.
The PHLX housing index was 0.5 percent higher, bucking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, rose 0.6 percent and  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) gained 0.5 percent. Pultegroup shares increased 0.4 percent. 
Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies.
HOMEBUILDER CONFIDENCE HIGH
Housing starts in the South soared 17.2 percent in October to 621,000 units, with single-family construction vaulting 16.6 percent to its highest level since 2007. There were also increases in homebuilding in the Midwest and Northeast.
""The pace of building came back stronger than before the storms hit, which suggests the increase from recovery may have already started in fourth quarter,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
October's increase in starts ended three straight months of declines, leading economists to expect that housing would contribute to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.
Homebuilding has struggled this year, hamstrung by shortages of land and labor as well as expensive lumber. Investment in homebuilding has contracted for two consecutive quarters. That has contributed to a worsening housing shortage, which has held back home sales.
A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders in November at the second-highest level since July 2005 amid optimism about current sales conditions and buyer traffic. Builders, however, continued to complain about the lack of buildable lots, land and pricey materials.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 5.3 percent to a rate of 877,000 units in October, the highest level in eight months.
Single-family starts fell 22.4 percent in the Northeast and slipped 7.7 percent in the West. They rose 7.8 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February.
Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 36.8 percent to a rate of 413,000 units.
Permits for future homebuilding increased 5.9 percent to a rate of 1.297 million units in October, the highest level since January. Single-family home permits rose 1.9 percent to their highest level since September 2007, while permits for the construction of multi-family homes jumped 13.9 percent.
Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. The rise in completions was, however, driven by the multi-family housing segment, which will probably do little to eliminate the acute shortage of properties available for sale.
Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to plug the inventory gap. 
Home completions for buildings with five units or more surged 37.9 percent last month to their highest level since April 1988. Single-family home completions increased only 2.6 percent last month.

""For a significant increase in new homes, municipalities are going to have to work harder to make more land available for building,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Japan's gross domestic product expanded for a seventh straight quarter in July-September due to strong exports such as cars and electronic parts to the United States and Asia.
Economists predict the economy will continue to grow moderately as exports retain their solid trend, however, Japan faces challenges in its bid to boost weak consumer spending and inflation.
Exports are forecast to have grown 15.8 percent in October from a year ago, the poll of 20 economists showed, as overseas demand for cars and semiconductor manufacturing equipment grew.
Imports likely rose 20.2 percent in October from a year ago, the fastest pace of growth since January 2014, as higher oil prices inflate import costs, the poll found.
The trade balance likely stood at 330.0 billion yen ($2.93 billion) in October, narrowing from a revised 667.7 billion yen in September.
""We expect exports will continue to grow because there is no change to favorable external environment in the October-December period so far,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2017 12:14PM ET</span>",U.S. industrial output surges as hurricane-related disruptions fade,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production recorded its biggest increase in six months in October as the drag from hurricane-related disruptions unwound, but the underlying growth trend in output at the nation's factories, mines and utility plants remained moderate.
Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in new filings for unemployment benefits last week in part because of the processing of a backlog of applications from Puerto Rico. The reports are consistent with an economy growing at a steady clip and tightening labor market conditions, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates next month.
""With encouraging fundamentals in place, we expect the slow but steady improvement in the U.S. factory sector to continue in the coming months,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Fed said industrial production accelerated 0.9 percent last month with output at factories surging 1.3 percent as operations returned to normalcy after being disrupted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which made landfall in late August and early September. 
The increase in industrial production was the largest since April and followed a 0.4 percent gain in September. Production was also buoyed by a 2.0 percent jump in output at utility plants.
But Hurricane Nate, which struck the Gulf Coast in early October, resulted in a decline in oil and gas drilling and extraction. That led to a 1.3 percent drop in mining output last month. The Fed said excluding the impact of the hurricanes, industrial production rose 0.3 percent in October, with manufacturing output advancing 0.2 percent.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by a weakening dollar, firming global economy and inventory accumulation by businesses.
With the surge in output last month, manufacturing capacity use rose 0.9 percentage point to 76.4 percent, the highest level since May 2008.
""The Fed estimates that manufacturing capacity is only growing by 0.7 percent per year, which points to the need to expand capacity at a faster rate should manufacturing output continue to grow at a solid pace,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The outlook for manufacturing is upbeat, with a measure of factory activity hovering near a 13-1/2-year high.
Although a separate report by the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed its index of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 22.7 this month from 27.9 in October, manufacturers reported robust demand for their products, rising backlogs and declining inventories. 
Factories, however, reported a slowdown in hiring as well as a shorter average workweek this month. A survey on Wednesday from the New York Fed mirrored the findings of the Philadelphia Fed survey.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, boosted by strong results from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). The world's largest retailer said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Nov. 11. 
It was the second straight weekly increase and partly reflected the clearing of a backlog of claims in Puerto Rico as the infrastructure damaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria is restored. 
Last week marked the 141st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
""The data continue to signal enough strength in employment growth to keep the unemployment rate trending down,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
    The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 44,000 to 1.86 million in the week ended Nov. 4, the lowest level since December 1973.
Tightening labor market conditions and signs that inflation is steadily creeping up make it most likely that the Fed will increase interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has raised borrowing costs twice this year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018.

Another report from the Labor Department showed import prices gained 0.2 percent last month amid increases in the cost of imported petroleum and capital goods. Import prices rose 0.8 percent in September.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that import prices gained 0.2 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.8 percent jump in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices increasing 0.4 percent in October after a previously reported 0.7 percent gain in September.
In the 12 months through October, import prices increased 2.5 percent, slowing after a 2.7 percent rise in September.
Last month, prices for imported petroleum increased 1.7 percent after surging 6.3 percent in September. Import prices excluding petroleum edged up 0.1 percent after shooting up 0.4 percent the prior month. Import prices excluding petroleum rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months through October.
A weak dollar, which has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, could keep import prices outside petroleum supported.
Imported capital goods prices rose 0.2 percent last month, while the cost of imported food fell 0.2 percent.
The report also showed export prices were unchanged in October as the biggest monthly increase in the price of agricultural exports in nearly 1-1/2 years was eclipsed by a drop in nonagricultural prices. Export prices rose 0.7 percent in September. They increased 2.7 percent year-on-year after rising 2.8 percent in September.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2017 06:05AM ET</span>","Britain's shoppers rein in spending, first yearly decline since 2013","By David Milliken and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales recorded their first year-on-year decline since 2013 last month as consumers struggled with fast-rising prices and stagnant wages.
Although the fall was less severe than analysts had expected, the official data showed a 0.3 percent year-on-year fall in sales volumes -- the biggest since March 2013.
That partly reflected a very strong performance by retailers in October 2016 which distorted the comparison.
""We are continuing to see an underlying picture of steady growth in retail sales, although this October suffered in comparison with a very strong October in 2016,"" ONS statistician Kate Davies said.
Mild weather also put shoppers off buying winter clothes, adding to the weakness in the figures.
But volumes were still far lower that they were before the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union hit sterling and drove up inflation.
Looking at the three months to October, which smoothes out monthly volatility in the data, sales growth picked up to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent in the three months to September.
This meant sales volumes in the three months to October were just 1.1 percent higher than the year before, the weakest growth rate since May 2013.
Sterling rose slightly after the data and British government bond prices edged down as the sales figures came in less weak than suggested by a series of other surveys of retailers.
""This is in stark contrast to the survey data which were pointing to an absolute bloodbath,"" Alan Clarke, an economist with Scotiabank, said. 
""Things are probably as bad as they are going to get, so I'd be hesitant to extrapolate the downward trend too far,"" he said. "" Next  year should be a better year as lower inflation and firmer wages reverse this year's downwards trend.""
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had predicted sales would drop 0.6 percent on the year and grow just 0.1 percent on the month, according to the median forecasts. 
The ONS said monthly sales in fact rose by 0.3 percent along with the minus 0.3 percent year-on-year figure.
SLOW DOWN
The Bank of England raised interest rates on Nov. 2, saying it forecast household consumption growth, adjusted for inflation, would slow to 1 percent next year from 1.5 percent.
It also said it expected inflation would peak in October before slowly falling back towards its 2 percent target over the next three years.
Official data earlier this week showed that consumer price inflation held at a five-year high of 3 percent in October while regular pay, adjusted for inflation, suffered its longest run of falls in almost three years.
Recent reports from British retailers have also indicated consumers may be tightening their belts. Department store chain John Lewis (JLP.UL) has posted seven straight weeks of sales decline, clothing retailer Next (L:NXT) missed analysts' quarterly forecasts, and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) said it faced ""stronger headwinds"" in food and was slowing openings of its upmarket convenience stores.
The ONS said that retail sales growth in cash terms slowed to an annual 2.8 percent in October, down from 4.6 percent in September and the weakest since June 2016. 

The gauge of inflation used in the retail sales data, the retail price deflator, dropped to 3.1 percent in October from 3.3 percent in September.

Gross domestic product rose 6.9 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the statistics agency said on Thursday, picking up from the upwardly revised 6.7 percent pace in the second quarter.
It was above the 6.5 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment rose for a 13th straight month in October, the longest stretch of gains since the early 1990s, while the jobless rate dipped to its lowest in over 4-1/2 years.
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed 3,700 net new jobs were eked out in October. That was short of forecasts of a 17,500 rise, but September was revised up to a solid increase of 26,600 from the first estimate of a gain of 19,800.
The detail was also upbeat with full-time jobs climbing 24,300, bringing gains for the year to a blistering 298,000.
The jobless rate dipped one tenth of a percentage point to 5.4 percent, under forecasts and the lowest since February 2013.
Health care has seen the lion's share of new jobs thanks in part to a government expansion in support for child care and carers, while the steady aging of the population should make the sector only bigger over time.
Construction jobs have also been on the rise amid a surge in public spending on infrastructure, a revival the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has called a new ""engine of growth"".
""The program of public works in the pipeline is now much higher than usual,"" said RBA Assistant Governor Luci Ellis earlier this week in an optimistic take on the outlook.
""Improving transport infrastructure could help boost productivity across a range of both traditional and new industries,"" she added.
""We are hearing from our contacts in industry that it is also spurring private businesses to invest in new equipment.""
NO PAY DAY
Yet while firms might be scooping up workers they are not so keen to pay them more, leaving wage growth near record lows and putting an unwelcome cap on consumer spending and inflation.
""Despite strong jobs growth, there is still plenty of slack in the labor market,"" said CBA senior economist John Peters.
""This slack will need to be substantially reduced before wage pressures crank up,"" he added. ""In this environment, talk of rate hikes over the next year is unrealistic.""
That outlook meant the jobs data had only a limited impact on financial markets, with the local dollar up 0.1 percent at $0.7594 <AUD=D4>.
Interest rate futures <0#YIB:> are not fully priced for a hike in the 1.5 percent cash rate until early 2019.
The scrooge-like pace of wage rises is a major reason the RBA recently forecast core inflation would not reach the floor of its 2 to 3 percent target band until early 2019, a year later than previously hoped.
Figures out on Wednesday showed annual wage growth edged up to 2.0 percent in the third quarter, but missed forecasts of 2.2 percent and were only a sliver above inflation at 1.8 percent.

And that tiny pick-up owed much to a relatively generous 3.3 percent hike in the minimum wage which was forced on reluctant employers by the government regulator.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>","Rising retail sales, weekly wages and inflation point to positive cycle for Fed","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Weekly wages are rising, American consumers are spending their money and prices are following suit in signs that a continued economic recovery sets the stage for a Federal Reserve rate rise in December and the cycle beyond that, despite concerns over low levels of inflation.
The U.S. core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy prices for a clearer look at underlying inflation, moved higher in October, rising after a sharp drop earlier in the year that had unnerved some U.S. policymakers.
The Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index has also reversed course, rising to 1.6 percent in September from 1.4 percent in August, and analysts argue it will feed off steady wage and job growth.
Further evidence: retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.2 percent in October and analysts estimate they may hit 3 percent annual growth for the full year.
Though the rise in inflation nicked a penny off of the average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers in October, a jump in the length of the work week made their paychecks fatter anyway. 
Average weekly earnings rose 2.6 percent for the same group of workers on an annual basis, the strongest increase since June, continuing a trend of rising wage gains under way since 2011.
Taken together the data caused some forecasters to bump up their estimates of economic growth for the year, and firm their expectations for the Fed's December action.
Inflation ""is gaining momentum gradually. The October data show a broadly based improvement,"" said advisers from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Research. The Fed ""will take comfort.""
Macroeconomic Advisers increased its estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.4 percent on the basis of the retail sales figures, and suggested retail sales would continue to grow. It pushed up its fourth-quarter GDP forecast to 2.5 percent. 
“We expect strong fundamentals for consumer spending - including continued job gains, firming real wage growth, and the recent strength in household net worth - to support solid gains in retail sales over the coming months,"" economist Kathleen Navin wrote.
The Fed has been debating through much of the year whether recent weak inflation was a signal of a developing problem in the economy, or whether low unemployment would eventually mean rising wages and prices moving closer to the Fed's 2 percent target. 
But in general policymakers have held close to the view that as long as job growth and household spending hold up, inflation can't be far beyond. 
If anything, New York Fed president William Dudley said at an earlier New York speech, the lull in inflation may prove a good thing - pushing up real wages and indicating that more people can be employed without price rises getting out of hand.

“It would imply that the U.S. economy could operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a troublesome large rise in inflation,"" Dudley said. ""More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis.""

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2017 12:27PM ET</span>",U.S. core inflation pushes higher; retail sales rise,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased in October on the back of a pickup in rents and healthcare costs, bolstering the view that a recent disinflationary trend worrying the Federal Reserve probably had ended.
The rise in the consumer price index, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday likely clears the way for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates next month. 
October's gain in the so-called core CPI, which measures underlying inflation pressures, could comfort Fed officials concerned that stubbornly low inflation may reflect not only temporary factors but also more persistent developments. 
""The Fed has struggled this year in determining if the slowdown in core inflation has been due to a confluence of one-offs or more persistent disinflationary forces,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""The pickup clears the way for a December rate hike and supports the case for continued tightening in the year ahead.""
The core CPI rose 0.2 percent in October, also lifted by increases in the cost of used cars and trucks, tobacco, wireless phone services, airline fares, education and motor vehicle insurance. It edged up 0.1 percent in September. 
October's gain lifted the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 1.8 percent. The year-on-year core CPI had increased by 1.7 percent for five straight months.
Last month, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence climbed 0.3 percent, quickening after September's 0.2 percent increase. The cost of hospital services were up 0.5 percent and prices for doctor visits rose 0.2 percent. 
Economists said the increase in healthcare costs suggested the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, probably rose 0.2 percent in October, which would snap five straight monthly 0.1 percent gains.
That would raise the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent in September.
""It appears the inflation rut that took hold in the spring may finally be behind us,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The core PCE price index has consistently undershot the Fed's 2 percent target for more than five years. 
The central bank has lifted borrowing costs twice this year and has projected three rate increases in 2018. The government will publish core PCE price index data later this month.
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies after an earlier slide, while prices for Treasuries were trading mostly higher. Stocks on Wall Street fell amid declining oil prices and concerns over the fate of a proposed U.S. tax overhaul in Congress.
HEALTHY CONSUMER SPENDING
Overall consumer prices, however, rose marginally in October as the boost to gasoline prices from hurricane-related disruptions to Gulf Coast oil refineries was unwound. 
The CPI nudged up 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.5 percent in September. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent in September. 
Low inflation is, however, helping to underpin consumer spending. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.2 percent last month as heavy price discounting by automobile manufacturers buoyed purchases of motor vehicles.
Data for September was revised to show sales jumping 1.9 percent, which was the largest gain since March 2015, rather than the previously reported 1.6 percent advance. Retail sales increased 4.6 percent on an annual basis.
The slowdown in retail sales from September's robust pace largely reflected an unwinding of the boost to building materials and gasoline prices after recent hurricanes. Receipts at auto dealerships increased 0.7 percent after soaring 4.6 percent in September, supported by the deep price discounting by manufacturers. Sales at gardening and building material stores fell 1.2 percent last month after surging 3.0 percent in September. 
Receipts at service stations decreased 1.2 percent in October. That followed a 6.4 percent gain in September. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month after climbing 0.5 percent in September. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Last month's increase in core retail sales indicated a healthy pace of consumer spending at the start of the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.

""We expect strong fundamentals for consumer spending, including continued job gains, firming real wage growth, and the recent strength in household net worth, to support solid gains in retail sales over the coming months,"" said Kathleen Navin, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers.

Receipts at auto dealerships increased 0.7 percent after soaring 4.6 percent in September. Sales at gardening and building material stores fell 1.2 percent last month after surging 3.0 percent in September.
Receipts at service stations decreased 1.2 percent in October. That followed a 6.4 percent gain in September. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month after climbing 0.5 percent in September.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Last month's increase in core retail sales indicated a healthy pace of consumer spending at the start of the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
Last month, sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.7 percent. Receipts at clothing stores climbed 0.8 percent in October, the biggest advance since March.
Sales at online retailers fell 0.3 percent. Receipts at restaurants and bars gained 0.8 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in September. Sales at sporting goods and hobby stores soared 1.5 percent.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices rose 0.1% in October from a month earlier, in line with forecasts and compared to a 0.5% gain in the previous month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.0% last month, also matching expectations and easing from the 2.2% advance seen in September.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, in line with consensus and compared to September’s 0.1% advance.
Furthermore, core CPI increased as expected at an annualized rate of 1.8% in October, beating forecasts that it would repeat the prior month’s reading of a 1.7% rise.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

At the same time, the inactivty rate - a measure of people not in work and not seeking a job - rose by the most in nearly eight years, the Office for National Statistics said.
The data showed the unemployment rate held at a four-decade low of 4.3 percent as the number of people in employment fell by 14,000 and pay growth remained much slower than inflation.
The ONS said workers' total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.2 percent in the three months to September, compared with 2.3 percent in the three months to August.
That was weaker than the latest 3.0 percent reading of British consumer price inflation.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 2.1 percent.

Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.2 percent year-on-year in line with expectations.

The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of September was unchanged at 4.3%, in line with economists’ expectations.
The number of people in employment fell for the first time in almost a year. There were 32.06 million people in work in the three months to September, a 14,000 drop on the previous quarter.
It was the first drop since August-October 2016, and the biggest decline since April-June 2015.

Economists had expected wage growth of 2.1%.
Excluding bonuses - which analysts say gives a better picture of the underlying trend – wages rose by 2.2% year-on-year, unchanged from the previous period and in line with forecasts.
That still leaves wages lagging behind inflation - which ran at a five-year high of 3.0% in September and October.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 09:43PM ET</span>","Japan's GDP grows for seven straight quarters, outlook remains solid","By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter due to strong exports, posting the longest period of uninterrupted growth in more than a decade.
The economy expanded at a 1.4 percent annualized rate in July-September, slightly above the median estimate for annualized growth of 1.3 percent, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
That followed revised annualized growth of 2.6 percent in April-June.
Consumer spending fell for the first time in seven quarters but this is expected to be temporary because the economy is near full employment, which should bolster domestic consumption in the future. Rising capital expenditure and exports are also expected to keep the economy growing, which should ease some concerns about sluggish inflation.
""Japan's potential growth rate is around 1 percent, so the results for the third quarter show the actual rate of growth is quite high,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The jobs market is doing so well that consumer spending is sure to pick up in the future. Capital expenditure still looks healthy. The economy is doing well.""
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3 percent compared to the previous quarter, which matched the median estimate and followed a 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter expansion in April-June, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
The results show that Japan's economy has grown for the seventh straight quarter, the longest period of expansion since an eight-quarter run from April-June 1999 to January-March 2001.
External demand - or exports minus imports - was the biggest reason for expansion, adding 0.5 percent to growth.Shipments of cars and electronic parts to the United States and Asia were strong in the third quarter, reflecting improving global demand, a Cabinet Office official told reporters.
In comparison, negative external demand subtracted a revised 0.2 percentage point from GDP growth in April-June.
Private consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, fell 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, more than the median estimate of a 0.3 percent contraction to mark the first decline since October-December 2015.
The decline was driven by lower spending at restaurants and hotels, as well as reduced spending on cars and mobile phones, the official said. Bad weather during the quarter may have hurt spending, the official said.
""There's no change to our view the economy is recovering moderately as a trend,"" Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters.
""We need to make the recovery a durable one, so we'll proceed with reforms to boost Japan's productivity.""
Capital expenditure rose 0.2 percent in July-September from the previous quarter, less than the median estimate for a 0.3 percent increase but still up for the fourth straight quarter.
Capital Economics' Senior Japan Economist Marcel Thielant said available data suggested that economic activity continued to expand in the current quarter, noting household incomes maintained solid growth and external demand was holding up.
""However, the economy is running into capacity constraints which suggests that growth will start to slow next year. We reiterate our forecast that growth will moderate from 1.5 percent this year to 1 percent in 2019,"" he said.
Japan's government is due to announce a package of economic measures by year-end aimed at increasing investment in skills training and raising productivity.

This long run of growth should encourage the Bank of Japan to stick with the current monetary easing framework, given its argument that inflationary pressure will percolate through the economy as long as growth is on track.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 12:11PM ET</span>",Services boost U.S. producer prices; underlying inflation firming,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in October, driven by a surge in the cost of services, leading to the biggest annual increase in wholesale inflation in more than 5-1/2 years.
Tuesday's report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which supported expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.
""Reports that inflation is dead or too low are not true in every corner of the economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It won't be long before producers will be faced with having to raise the prices of consumer goods if inflation continues to percolate here.""
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 2.8 percent, the largest rise since February 2012, from 2.6 percent in September.
Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago. Last month's rise in prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries reflected a 0.5 percent surge in the cost of services, mostly margins received by wholesalers and retailers. 
Margins for fuels and lubricants retailing soared 24.9 percent, accounting for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month. Services rose 0.4 percent in September. 
The rise in services helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices spiked 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.
Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. The strong producer price readings probably did not translate into higher consumer prices in October as the correlation between the PPI and consumer price index has weakened. 
Still, firming inflation at the factory gate is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who have long argued that price pressures were being held back by transitory factors.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target since mid-2012. 
Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month amid cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year. The Fed has hiked rates twice this year.
""While not the primary measure of inflation, the consistent gradual improvement in producer prices over the past two years will be welcomed by Fed officials who, on balance, continue to express confidence in a gradually rising inflation outlook,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
MARGINAL CPI GAINS EXPECTED
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, with traders awaiting October's consumer inflation data on Wednesday, which is expected to show a marginal increase in consumer prices. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks slipped as declining oil prices hit energy stocks. 
Outside services, producer price increases were fairly broad last month. There were increases in the cost of pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco. Prices for passenger cars were, however, unchanged in October following the introduction of the 2018 models into the survey. 
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent in October month, advancing by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.
Core goods prices increased 0.3 percent in October after a similar gain in the prior month. The weakening dollar, which has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, could gradually lift core producer inflation.

The cost of healthcare services increased 0.3 percent in October after being unchanged in September. Those costs feed into the core PCE price index.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased 0.4% last month, topping the forecast for a 0.1% gain and matching September’s increase.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.8% in October, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.4% and higher than the 2.6% increase in the preceding month.

Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 2.4% last month, above forecasts for a 2.3% increase and the gain of 2.2% in September.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's trade deficit widened to its highest in nearly three years in October, government data showed on Tuesday, as export growth contracted for the first time after more than a year.
The trade deficit  widened to $14.02 billion last month from $8.98 billion in September, data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry showed.
The trade deficit has widened by more $31 billion in the first seven months of the current financial year to $86.15 billion, which could put pressure on the current account deficit of Asia's third largest economy. 
Merchandise exports  for October fell 1.12 percent from a year earlier to $23.1 billion, dropping for the first time since August 2016, dragged down by fall in gems, jewelry and textile exports. 
A large number of exporters have been unable to meet their export orders despite a revival in global demand as billions of dollars were stuck under the new nationwide tax launched in July, exporters said.
""The refund of inputs tax credit under the new Goods and Service Tax system has been stuck since July, hitting exports,"" Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said.
Goods imports were up 7.6 percent from a year earlier to $37.12 billion.
Higher crude oil prices and a more than a quarter jump in volume from a year ago pushed India's petroleum imports to $9.29 billion, also helping to widen the trade gap.
Crude prices have rallied, sending Brent crude to its highest since June 2015, a worry given that India imports most of its energy needs.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy shifted into an even higher gear in the third quarter, propelled by buoyant exports and rising company investments in equipment, data showed on Tuesday.
In a further positive sign for Europe's biggest economy, the ZEW institute said investor morale improved in November and prospects for the economy remained ""encouragingly positive"" thanks to high levels of growth across Europe.
Germany is enjoying a consumer-led upswing, helped by record-high employment, moderate inflation and ultra-low borrowing costs. The upturn is boosting tax revenues and the budget surplus, which should help Chancellor Angela Merkel seal a tricky three-way coalition agreement in coming weeks.
Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.8 percent on the quarter, data from the Statistics Office showed on Tuesday. This beat a consensus forecast of in a Reuters poll of 0.6 percent, which was also the second quarter growth rate.
""The upswing continues and it's broad-based,"" Sal. Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens said, noting that companies were also contributing to the expansion by stepping up investments.
The German economy grew by 2.3 percent on the year in the third quarter, unadjusted data showed. This was in line with a consensus forecast.
Adjusted for calendar affects, the yearly growth rate rose to 2.8 percent in the July-September period from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter, the office said. This was the strongest reading since the beginning of 2014.
The Federal Statistics Office also revised up the quarterly growth rate for the first quarter to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent. ""This makes an upward revision for overall growth estimates likely,"" DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said.
The government expects the economy to grow 2.0 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018. This would translate into calendar-adjusted rates of 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent respectively.
The Statistics Office said positive impulses for growth in the third quarter came mainly from net foreign trade as exports increased more strongly than imports.
""While state and household consumption remained roughly on the previous quarter's level, gross capital investments contributed to overall growth,"" the office said. ""Especially investments in equipment rose on the quarter.""
In its monthly report, the economy ministry said that the solid economic upswing would stretch into the fourth quarter.
""The indicators point to a brisk continuation of the upswing in the final quarter of the year,"" it said.
BOOST FOR MERKEL
The surprisingly strong figures will make welcome reading for Merkel as her conservatives try to forge a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens, an alliance untested on a national level.
""As firms are now investing more, this will also increase productivity,"" DZ Bank analyst Michael Holstein said. ""This can also lead to stronger pay hikes - the upswing is entering a new phase.""
But the upswing in Europe's biggest economy has yet to start pushing up inflation on a sustained basis.
EU-harmonized consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent in October from the previous month, separate data from the Statistics Office showed.
The annual inflation rate fell to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent in September, dropping further below the European Central Bank's target of nearly 2 percent despite its unprecedented monetary stimulus program.
The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its monthly survey on investor morale showed that its economic sentiment index rose to 18.7 from 17.6 in October.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions shot up to 88.8 from 87.0 last month.
""The prospects for the German economy remain encouragingly positive,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said, adding that strong growth rates across Europe were supporting future growth in Germany and boosting expectations for the coming six months.

""This favorable economic climate should be used to create a stronger and more robust basis for future growth,"" Wambach added.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>",UK headline inflation unexpectedly holds steady in October,"LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - British inflation held at its highest level in five-and-a-half years in October, and wrong-footed expectations from the Bank of England and other economists that it would hit a new peak.
Consumer price inflation held at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in October, the Office for National Statistics said, below economists' average expectation in a Reuters poll for a 3.1 percent annual rise.
The BoE said this month, after it raised interest rates for the first time in a decade, that inflation would probably peak at 3.2 percent in October and then fall slowly to just above its 2 percent target in three years' time.
Tuesday's figures are likely to reinforce doubts among economists about the wisdom of the BoE's decision to raise rates at a time when the economy is sluggish, especially as the effect of last year's Brexit vote on import prices was already at its high point.
BoE Governor Mark Carney has said the overshoot of the 2 percent target was due to the effect of the more than 10 percent fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote pushing up the price of imported goods.
British inflation surged from a subdued 0.5 percent at the time of the Brexit vote in June 2016 to its highest since April 2012 in September.
The ONS said October's steady reading reflected falls in fuel prices being offset by a higher cost of food - including a noticeable impact from more expensive potato crisps.
The alternative measure of retail price inflation, which is used to calculate payments on government bonds and many commercial contracts, rose to a near six-year high of 4.0 percent - bad news for finance minister Philip Hammond as he prepares an annual budget due on Nov. 22.
However, the failure of consumer price inflation to exceed 3 percent means Carney will be spared a legal duty of having to write a letter to Hammond alongside next month's rate decision, explaining why inflation is more than a percentage point above target.
Many economists criticized the BoE's decision to raise rates earlier this month. They say inflation is on track to fall as the worst of the inflationary impact of the weak pound passes, and there are few signs that Britain's slow-growing economy is likely to overheat and generate above-target inflation on its own.
However, the BoE says that leaving the EU will damage Britain's ability to grow as fast as before without generating excess inflation, and that the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 makes labor shortages and a rebound in wage growth a risk.
Tuesday's data confirmed that some underlying price pressures are easing.
Costs of manufacturers' raw materials - much of them imported - were 4.6 percent higher than in October 2016, down from an inflation rate of 8.1 percent in September. This was the rate of producer input price inflation since July 2016, a month after the Brexit vote when the effect of the pound's fall was first being felt on the sterling cost of imported commodities.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a fall to 4.8 percent.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by an annual 2.8 percent compared with 3.3 percent in September, the lowest since November 2016 and below forecasts for this to slow to 2.9 percent.
The ONS also said prices in September rose by an annual 5.4 percent across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 4.8 percent in August, the biggest increase in almost a year. Prices in London alone remained soft, rising by 2.5 percent, the weakest since February.

In a report, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 3.0% last month matching September’s reading.
That was below forecasts for a 3.1% increase but remained at its highest level since March 2012.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.1% in October, also below consensus expectations for a 0.2% advance and compared to the 0.3% gain registered in the previous month.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.7% last month, also in line with September’s increase and missing expectations for a gain of 2.8%.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 4.0% on annualized basis in October, compared to previous month’s 3.9% rise. Analysts had expected inflation to increase to 4.1%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by just 0.1% in October, in line with a month earlier and compared to the forecast for a 0.2% gain.
Core RPI increased as expected at an annualized rate of 4.2% in October, higher than the 4.1% rise registered a month earlier.
Month-on-month, core RPI held steady at a 0.1% gain last month.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.4% in October, above forecasts for a gain of 5.2% and following a 4.8% increase a month earlier. September’s data was revised from an initial 5.0% rise.
The ONS indicated that rising prices for food and, to a lesser extent, recreational goods provided the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between September 2017 and October 2017.
“The upward contributions were offset by falling motor fuel and furniture prices, along with owner occupiers’ housing costs, which remained unchanged between September 2017 and October 2017, having risen a year ago,” the ONS said.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.3091 from around 1.3116 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8949 from 0.8925 earlier while GBP/JPY changed hands at 148.90, compared to 149.33 previously.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 03:29AM ET</span>","China's economy cools as government curbs hit factories, property and retailers","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy cooled further last month, with industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail sales missing expectations as the government extended a crackdown on debt risks and factory pollution.
Beijing is already in the second year of a campaign to reduce high levels of debt as authorities worry that riskier lending practices, especially in the real estate sector, could imperil the economy. 
Data on Tuesday suggested policy makers are making progress in defusing financial risks by weaning China off its years-long addiction to cheap credit, and signaled moderating growth over the next few quarters.
Industrial output rose 6.2 percent year-on-year in October, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, missing analysts' estimates of a 6.3 percent gain and lagging a 6.6 percent increase in September. 
Fixed-asset investment growth also slowed to 7.3 percent in the January-October period, from 7.5 percent in the first nine months. Analysts had expected an increase of 7.4 percent.
""The moderation in activity data released today suggests that growth slowed in October and adds to our conviction that it will continue to do so in the quarters ahead,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note to clients.
In the property sector, where authorities have tightened rules to flush out speculative financing that has helped drive a two-year boom, sales and new construction starts fell in October. 
Property investment growth also cooled to 5.6 percent in October year-on-year, from 9.2 percent in September, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics data out on Tuesday. 
“I think this (slowdown in real estate) is exactly what the government is looking to do. I don’t see them changing their policy course,” said Jonas Short, who heads the Beijing office at investment bank Sun Hung Kai Financial (SHKF).
Data on Monday showed China's new loans fell more than expected last month to their lowest in a year as banks tightened mortgage lending. 
SURPRISING STRENGTH
China's economy has surprised financial markets with robust growth of nearly 6.9 percent in the first nine months of this year, underpinned by a recovery in its manufacturing and industrial sectors thanks to a government-led infrastructure spending spree, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports.
That has supported the world economy as the Asian giant has continued to hoover up commodities and consumer goods, helping to stoke underlying global demand for cars and smartphones to TVs and industrial products.
And the overall picture backs the consensus view that the Chinese economy is entering a period of moderation rather than a rapid deceleration. China's producer prices, for instance, were surprisingly strong in October, while profits at the country's industrial heavyweights surged 27.7 percent in September, the most in nearly six years.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), the Chinese e-commerce giant, said on Saturday it hit $25.4 billion in sales from China's Singles' Day - an annual 24-hour buying frenzy that exceeds the combined sales for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States and acts as a barometer for China's consumers.
QUALITY OVER SPEED
Since the third quarter, however, the world's second-largest economy has started to show signs of fatigue, with momentum seen slackening further as Beijing's crackdown on debt risks curbs demand and tighter pollution rules hits factory output. 
China's exports and import growth both eased last month, while the smog war dragged on manufacturing activity and pulled average daily crude steel output down for a second straight month in October
The latest data also showed consumers might be tightening their purse strings. 
Retail sales gained 10 percent in October on-year, versus an expected 10.4 percent rise and below the 10.3 percent growth in September. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment slowed to 5.8 percent for Jan-Oct, from 6.0 percent in the nine months ended September.
Analysts say that fiscal stimulus might also be pared back.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said the economic impact of debt curbs and capacity closures to meet environmental standards were partly offset by strong infrastructure spending.
""But this support seems unlikely to last given that local governments are set to reduce spending in the final months of the year in order to meet budget targets.""
At China's recently-concluded Communist Party Congress, President Xi Jinping said the country would focus on quality over speed as it pursues economic growth, and reinforced a pledge to win the war on pollution and clamp down on riskier types of lending.
That leaves policy makers walking a tight rope as China continues to rebalance its economic drivers away from investment and exports toward domestic demand.
Most China observers say Beijing would not risk a sharp slowdown in growth through its debt and pollution clampdown given a major focus on creating jobs. 
While the People's Bank of China kept liquidity tight through much of the year by raising short term rates, growth is still expected to easily meet the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent for 2017.
""The economy is fundamentally strong in other areas...industrial production is only moderating, it’s still at really high levels,"" SHKF's Short said.

""There’s still some caution (on the economy), but we’re certainly not pessimistic. I’d say we are quite optimistic.""

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 12:10AM ET</span>","Japan wages seen rising 2-2.5 percent in spring, below Abe's target: Reuters poll","By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wages will rise by 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent at next spring's annual negotiations, falling short of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of 3 percent, economists polled by Reuters predicted.
Abe's government is considering tax incentives and other means to encourage companies to raise wages by 3 percent, hoping consumers will spend more and accelerate Japan's stubbornly low inflation.
This year, major Japanese companies -- which negotiate with labor unions every spring to agree on a wage hike -- raised pay an average 1.98 percent, according to Rengo, Japan's biggest labor federation.
Japanese companies are sitting on piles of cash reserves from strong earnings but are reluctant to raise fixed costs such as wages because they are worried about Japan's shrinking population.
They also want to have a large cash buffer on hand in case of a financial or international political crisis.
Of the 38 analysts polled, 19 predicted wages will rise around 2.5 percent, while 17 projected a gain of around 2 percent. One penciled in a 3 percent hike and another said the gain would be less than 2 percent.
""Significant recovery in corporate profits suggests firms will likely raise wages,"" said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""But there are industries such as retailers which find it hard to pass on rising costs to customers, so it is difficult for many firms to raise wages significantly even if the government implements tax benefits.""
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, has been enjoying its second-longest stretch of post-war growth - but weak wage growth has contributed to limp consumer spending.
Economists projected the economy would grow 1.6 percent for the fiscal year through March and 1.1 percent over the next year, unchanged from the last monthly survey.
ELUSIVE TARGET
The poll, conducted Nov. 1 to Nov. 13, also showed the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was expected to average 0.6 percent this fiscal year and 0.8 percent the next.
That's lower than the Bank of Japan's forecasts of 0.8 and 1.4 percent, respectively.
In September, core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier, up for a ninth straight month, but failed to accelerate from August.
The central bank was last month still predicting inflation will hit its 2 percent target by March 2020, after pushing back the timeframe several times.
A majority of the economists surveyed said they believed the BOJ will start unwinding its stimulus policy when it next decides to change policy, but the timing was likely to be later next year or beyond. 
""The BOJ will not ease further as long as the upward momentum of inflation is maintained, even though 2 percent inflation will not be satisfied by fiscal 2019,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JP Morgan Securities Japan.
""We expect the BOJ will adjust its 10-year JGB yield target for the first time when CPI excluding fresh food and energy reaches 1 percent and medium-term inflation expectations rise accordingly.""

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly valuable gauge as the Fed cautiously raises interest rates in the face of below-target inflation, showed the one-year-ahead measure was 2.61 percent in October, its second monthly rise. That's up from 2.54 percent the month before and the highest since April.
The three-year-ahead expectation was 2.81 percent, slightly up from the previous month and also at the highest level since April.
Both gauges have generally slipped since the survey began in mid-2013, covering a period in which spot inflation levels have lingered below a 2-percent Fed target. The central bank has nonetheless raised rates four times since late 2015 in a nod to strong employment and steady economic growth, and expects to tighten policy again next month.

The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian economy grew 1.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2017, the Federal Statistics Service said on Monday.
That was slower than in the second quarter, when the economy grew 2.5 percent, its best annual rate since the third quarter of 2012.
""The year-on-year growth rate was depressed by the fact that there was one fewer working day in Q3 this year than in Q3 2016 – something Rosstat doesn't adjust for,"" research firm Capital Economics said in a note.
The 1.8 percent expansion in gross domestic product is a preliminary reading and could be revised later this year when the Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat, provides a detailed breakdown of economic growth factors.
Following the data release, Capital Economics said it was lowering its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.8 percent from a previously expected 2.3 percent.
The Russian economy is recovering from a full-blown crisis caused by a massive drop in prices for oil, its key export, and by economic sanctions imposed by the West over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.
Analysts polled by Reuters in late October had on average expected 2017 GDP growth of 1.8 percent after two consecutive years of contraction.

Officials are more upbeat on Russia's economic prospects, saying GDP could expand by more than 2 percent in the whole of 2017.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation picked up in October to a seven-month high, driven by faster rises in prices of food and fuel products, dampening chances of an interest rate cut by the central bank next month.
India's annual consumer inflation <INCPIY=ECI> in October increased to 3.58 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October's CPI inflation rate would edge up to 3.46 percent from September's 3.28 percent.
Some analysts expect India's decision on Friday to slash tax rates on 178 items such as chocolates and detergent powders to 18 percent from 28 percent could marginally lower retail inflation in coming months.
""There is, however, a low likelihood of a rate cut by the RBI in the immediate term,"" said Aditi Nayar, an economist at ICRA, an Indian arm of the rating agency Moody's, adding that inflationary expectations could remain high in the second half of the fiscal year that ends in March.
RBI holds a policy review on Dec. 6.
Retail inflation has been steadily rising since June, when it eased to 1.46 percent - its slowest pace since India started releasing such figures in January 2012, based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.
Separately, annual industrial output <INIP=ECI> grew a lower-than-expected 3.8 percent in September, compared with the forecast of 4.2 percent by economists in a Reuters poll, data released on Friday showed.
Prices pressures are building just as the Reserve Bank of India projected last month inflation to rise in October-March to 4.2-4.6 percent, above its medium-target of 4 percent, while leaving rates unchanged.
Crude prices have rallied, sending Brent crude to its highest since June 2015, a worry given that India imports most of its energy needs.
Despite a cut in taxes, retail petrol prices have gone up by 7.6 percent and diesel by 6.6 percent in New Delhi in the last year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces crucial state elections in his home state of Gujarat next month, is under pressure to revive economic growth, which slipped to 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace in three years.
New Delhi, facing risks of a widening fiscal deficit this year mainly due to lower growth in revenue receipts, wants the RBI to ease policy rates to support private investments and revive economic growth.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2017 07:30PM ET</span>","Outlook for UK pay growth improves, but only a little: CIPD","LONDON (Reuters) - British employers expect to raise pay for their workers only a little despite strong demand for staff and already low unemployment, according to an industry survey that suggested no immediate respite for the country's squeezed households.
The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development said its gauge of pay intentions for the private and public sector rose 2 percent in the latest quarter from 1 percent previously. 
CIPD said planned pay rises in the private sector were clustering around 2 percent, the median for the last five years.
Last week the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time since 2007 and predicted wage growth will pick up next year to 3 percent, up from a range of 1.8 to 2.2 percent seen in recent months.
But CIPD said 38 percent of private sector firms faced no pressure at all to raise wages for the majority of their workforce, compared with only 24 percent that said they did.
The squeeze on household incomes from high inflation and weak wage growth was a big factor behind the slowdown in Britain's economy in the first half of 2017. 
A separate survey from payments company Visa on Monday showed British shoppers reined in their spending by the most in more than four years in October.
""Over time we might expect low unemployment levels to lead to increased pressure on pay, as the Bank of England has predicted,"" Gerwyn Davies, CIPD senior labor market analyst, said.
""However, it's the UK's ongoing poor productivity growth that's currently preventing employers from paying more, not their inability to find or retain staff.""
Last month, Britain's official budget watchdog said it expects to ""significantly"" downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years, something that could hurt the government's finances. 
There was better news for public sector workers. CIPD said 59 percent of public sector employers reported pressure to hike salaries for most staff, most of whom are subject to a long-standing pay cap for state workers that may soon be ditched. 
Prime Minister Theresa May has eased seven years of public sector pay caps modestly and for police and prison guards. 
Finance minister Philip Hammond is under pressure to relax pay constraints further in his annual budget on Nov. 22.
CIPD said its gauge of employment demand eased only slightly from the previous quarter and remained near record high levels.
Official labor market data due on Wednesday is expected to show the unemployment rate will stay at a four-decade low of 4.3 percent, but with no improvement in wage growth, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

CIPD's survey was based on 2,007 employers and was conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 3.

Consumer spending - adjusted for inflation and seasonal effects - fell by 2.0 percent in October compared with the same month last year, Visa said, based on its credit and debit card data. It was the fifth fall in the last six months.
In monthly terms, spending was down 0.9 percent from September.
""The figures are a stark indicator of the strain on household budgets even before the Bank of England's recent interest rate rise,"" Mark Antipof, Visa's chief commercial officer, said.
The BoE last week increased its benchmark borrowing rate to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent, despite many private economists warning that high inflation and weak wage growth was already squeezing household spending hard.
A survey published on Monday showed British employers expect to raise pay for their workers only a little despite strong demand for staff and already low unemployment.
Visa said clothing and footwear suffered the biggest fall in October, down an annual 9 percent, as warm weather put shoppers off buying winter clothes. Falls were also seen in other key areas of spending such as on food and drink and recreation and culture which until recently was growing strongly.
Visa said November's so-called Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales would provide a clearer sign of how the Christmas season was shaping up.
The weak data from Visa echoed other surveys which have pointed to a sharp slowdown in spending in October. 

Economists polled by Reuters expect official retail sales data, due to be published on Thursday, will show the sharpest fall since March 2013, when Britain's economy was just starting to emerge from its post-financial crisis lethargy.

The preliminary publication of the data for this month from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment fell to 97.8 from 100.7 in the previous month.
Analysts had forecast the reading to remain unchanged.
The current conditions indicator also unexpectedly fell to 113.6 in November, from the previous 116.5, settling below above forecasts for an increase to 116.8.
Consumer expectations dropped to 87.6 this month, missing the consensus forecast for the reading to remain unchanged at 90.5.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 2.6% from the prior 2.4%, while the reading five years out held steady at 2.5%.
University of Michigan Chief Economist Richard Curtin explained that the decline in early November was due to widespread losses across current and expected economic conditions but defined the losses as “quite small”, explaining that the sentiment index remained at its second highest level since January.
“An improving labor market was spontaneously mentioned by a record number of consumers in early November, and anticipated wage gains recorded their highest two-month level in a decade,” Curtin added.
After the report, the dollar lost some ground. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1666 from around 1.1655 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3210, compared to 1.3203 previously, while USD/JPY traded at 113.27 from 113.32 earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - British industry had its strongest month so far this year in September, but more signs of strain on consumers and a plunge in construction were reminders that the economy looks set for a difficult 2018 as Brexit approaches.
The figures published on Friday suggested manufacturing may help to counteract a consumer-led slowdown and offered some vindication to the Bank of England which last week raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years.
""Stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound seems to be finally showing through in the UK manufacturing numbers,"" said ING economist James Smith. 
The Office for National Statistics also announced a 1.6 percent monthly drop in construction, while separate figures published on Friday showed British shops suffered their worst October for sales in a decade.
""Given that manufacturing represents a relatively small share of the UK economy, the persistent weakness in consumer spending is a bigger consideration for the Bank of England,"" Smith said.
Most economists polled by Reuters think Britain's economy will slow next year, in large part due to uncertainty created by a lack of progress in talks on the terms of Britain's divorce from the European Union.
But next week's data on wage growth, inflation and retail sales will offer a more complete picture of an uneven economy around which finance minister Philip Hammond must engineer an annual budget, due on Nov. 22.
NO CHANGE TO GDP VIEW
The ONS said Friday's data backed up its preliminary estimate of growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, picking up a bit from earlier in 2017 but still slower than the rate in the euro zone. 
Industrial and manufacturing output shot up by a monthly 0.7 percent in September, the fastest growth for each sector since December last year and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which pointed to a reading of 0.3 percent for both.
Industrial output, which includes manufacturing, accounts for 14 percent of Britain's economic output.
Figures for the much bigger services sector are due on Nov. 23.
For the third quarter as a whole, there was little change to estimates for industrial, manufacturing and construction output that appeared in the ONS' preliminary economic growth estimate.
Until now, the official readings of manufacturing have tended to show a weaker picture for the sector than upbeat surveys over 2017.
Separately, the ONS said Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed by much more than expected to 11.253 billion pounds in September from 12.350 billion, helped by a rise in exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 12.8 billion.
That was not enough to prevent a deterioration in Britain's trade performance in the third quarter, however, which looks likely to be a sizeable drag on economic growth.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the narrowing of the deficit in September almost entirely reflected an improvement in trade in erratic items.

Until now, there has been little sign of any big boost to British exports from the sharp fall in the value of the pound that followed last year's Brexit vote.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's trade-reliant economy posted slower growth in the third quarter, but strong consumption and rebounding exports led the government to nudge up its growth outlook for 2017.
Supported by improving retail sales, a rebound in mainland tourist arrivals and strong global trade, the economy grew a seasonally-adjusted 0.5 percent in the third quarter. That compared with upwardly revised 1.1 percent growth previously.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 3.6 percent in the third quarter compared with revised 3.9 percent growth in the second. Economists had forecast an expansion of 3.5 percent.
The still-solid momentum puts the former British colony firmly on track to achieve the government's revised full-year estimate of 3.7 percent growth for 2017 as buoyant stock and property markets helped spur consumer spending. 
In October, it forecast full-year growth of 3-4 percent. 
Looking ahead, the government expects the economy to remain on a solid footing although it warned of the prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and elevated geopolitical risks globally.
""Along with an improving global outlook, major advanced economies are likely to show further moderate expansion in the rest of the year,"" the government said in a statement.
""The mainland economy is also set to sustain sound and notable growth. The expansion in global demand should bode well for Asia's and Hong Kong's goods exports in the near term.""
EXPORTS, RETAIL SALES STRONG
Exports recorded year-on-year growth of 5.5 percent in real terms in the third quarter, led by those to Asian markets. 
A pick-up in the number of visitors from mainland China and Hong Kong's retail sales growing at their fastest annual pace in more than 30 months in September has boosted economic activity.
Further underpinning growth have been record high property prices and a buoyant stock market.
""The strength of private consumption is due to a relative low unemployment rate and wealth effect due to buoyant property and stocks markets,"" said Thomas Shik, acting chief economist of Hang Seng Bank.
""The positive factors are likely to continue in the following quarter,"" Shik said, adding the bank was likely to revise up its 2017 growth forecast, currently at 3.4 percent.
The government said upside risks to inflation remained limited, prompting it to revise down underlying and
headline consumer price inflation for 2017 to 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, from 1.8 percent and 1.6 percent. 
With its economy closely tied to its giant northern neighbour, Hong Kong has also gained from buoyant trading and manufacturing activities linked to China's resilient economic activity this year.
Some economists have warned, however, that the city could face pressure from rising borrowing costs and increasing tensions with Beijing that could threaten stability and impede policy-making. 

Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing has gradually increased control over the city even though it promised wide-ranging freedoms and autonomy not allowed on the mainland under the formula of ""one country, two systems"".

Households' average financial assets rose 6.8 percent from a year ago to 11.5 million yen ($101,447) in 2017 thanks to a 25 percent rise in Japanese stock prices, an annual survey by the Central Council for Financial Services Information (CCFSI), a body administered by the Bank of Japan, showed on Friday.
But uncertainty over Japan's social welfare provisions being maintained among a rapidly ageing population prevented households from turning to riskier investments, underscoring the challenge the central bank faces in nudging the country's risk-shy population to invest rather than save cash in accounts.
The ratio of households who made ends meet as expected or felt better-off rose to 30.7 percent from 29.2 percent in the previous year, as more people joined the workforce amid a tightening job market, the survey showed.
But 54.1 percent of households' financial assets were held in savings and bank deposits, with only 8.9 percent held in stocks, the survey showed.
When asked how they choose which financial assets to hold, 46.6 percent said they would prioritize security such as a guarantee of principal, with only 18.7 percent saying they focus on profitability.
In a worrying sign for the consumption outlook, a record high 43.2 percent of single households said they had no plans to own a house, more than double the ratio 10 years ago.
While it was unclear from the survey why households preferred not to own a house, it may be because more day-care and other facilities catering to seniors are becoming available in Japan's ageing society, said Kengo Kato, deputy director-general of the CCFSI.
""More people may be feeling they don't necessarily need to own a house"" in preparing for retirement, he told a briefing.
Japan's economy likely expanded for a seventh straight quarter in July-September, thanks to robust exports and consumption, a Reuters poll showed. [nL3N1NG1Z3]
The Nikkei average hit a near 26-year-high this week on expectations of strong corporate earnings, while the jobless rate slid to levels the BOJ considers as close to full employment.
But inflation and wage growth remain subdued, casting doubt over the long-term sustainability of the recovery.
The survey targeted 8,000 households nationwide from June 16 to July 25, with 47.1 percent replying.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected have grown for a seventh straight quarter in July-September, a period of unbroken expansion last seen between 1999 and 2001, a Reuters poll found on Friday. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have grown at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent in the third quarter, the poll of 20 analysts showed.
That result would mark a seventh straight growth quarter, the longest period of expansion since an eight-quarter run from April-June 1999 to January-March 2001.
Quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent is expected after a revised 0.6 percent rise in the second quarter.
""Consumer spending was seen stalling in July-September but export growth likely supported solid economic expansion,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. 
The poll found that private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, probably slipped 0.4 percent in the third quarter, the first fall in seven quarters. 
External demand - or exports minus imports - was seen contributing 0.4 percentage point to growth, the poll found, after it subtracted 0.3 percentage point from GDP growth in April-June.
Capital spending was seen rising 0.3 percent in the third quarter, growing for a fourth straight quarter, following a 0.5 percent rise the previous quarter. 
""We forecast the economy will continue to grow as both domestic and external demand pick up thanks to the global economic recovery and a softer yen,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""But there is downside risk from the Chinese economy and we also need to closely monitor geopolitical risk from the North Korean situation,"" he said. 
The Cabinet Office will announce the GDP data on Nov. 15 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Nov. 14).
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, was seen likely to have risen an annual 3.1 percent in October, the poll found.
Such a result would mark a 10th straight rising month and the fastest annual rate of increase since October 2008, excluding the effect of a sales tax hike in 2014.
The central bank will release the CGPI data on Nov. 13 at 8:50 a.m Japan Time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers slipped in November from a decade high seen the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, but it remained strong - underscoring the economy's continuing expansion.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, also found service-sector firms' sentiment edging up, a further sign of broadening recovery.
""The Reuters Tankan indicated that sentiment in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing remained elevated and that the outlook was also firm, reflecting strong domestic and overseas demand,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""We expect the BOJ tankan sentiment index in December to exceed company projections at the time of the September survey.""
The latest survey results bolster the argument that Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is gathering momentum from its brisk export performance and firmer domestic demand.
""The economy is in a moderate recovery trend, but capital spending lacks some strength due to uncertainty over the outlook on the global economy,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey, in which companies respond anonymously. 
The poll of 547 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 255 firms responded, was conducted Oct. 26 to Nov. 7.
The sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 27 from a decade-high of 31 in October. Sentiment deteriorated sharply among producers of industrial materials such as refined oils and chemicals, likely reflecting worsening terms of trade due to a weakening yen and rising oil prices.
Service-sector sentiment rose one point to 31, led by real estate/construction firms that benefit from the BOJ's easy money.
Retailers were more muted, a concern for the health of private consumption that constitutes some 60 percent of the economy.
""The operating rate of buildings is performing well. Marked increase in activity is seen among the wealthy who seek residences worth 300 million yen to 1 billion yen ($8.75 million). Demand for real estate among ordinary people is slow,"" a real estate firm said. 
The Bank of Japan's last tankan showed big manufacturers were the most optimistic for the business outlook in a decade.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

BOJ policymakers hope a sustained economic recovery will boost wages and consumer spending, but analysts expect inflation to remain below the central bank's 2 percent target for some time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, suggesting that claims processing disrupted by recent hurricanes has begun to improve.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Nov. 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims had fallen to 229,000 in the prior week, near a 44-1/2-year low, and remain well below the 300,000 level generally regarded as signaling a healthy labor market.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 231,000 in the latest week. They have declined from an almost three-year high of 298,000 hit at the start of September in the aftermath of hurricanes that ravaged parts of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
The Labor Department noted that it is now processing backlogged claims in Puerto Rico though its operations in the Virgin Islands remain severely disrupted. 
U.S. Treasury yields held near session highs after the data, while the dollar trimmed losses. U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower, a day after Wall Street closed at a record high.
Last week marked the 139th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,250, to 231,250 last week, the lowest level since March 31, 1973. That suggests ongoing job growth in an economy many regard as near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
The so-called continuing claims rose 17,000 to 1.90 million. Economists polled by Reuters had expected continuing claims of 1.89 million. 

The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell 750, to 1.90 million, the lowest level since Jan. 12, 1974, suggesting a continued decline in labor market slack.

Analysts expected jobless claims to increase by 2,000 to 231,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 231,250, down 1,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended November 3 rose to 1.934 million from 1.901 million in the preceding week.
USD/JPY was at 113.35 from around 113.32 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1625 from around 1.1629 earlier, while GBP/USD was at 1.3111 from 1.3118.

The consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to rise 1.8 percent on-year compared with an increase of 1.6 percent in September.
Producer prices rose 6.9 percent on-year, unchanged from previous month's increase.
Analysts had predicted the PPI would rise 6.6 percent. 
China's economy recorded better-than-expected growth of nearly 6.9 percent through the first nine months of this year, buoyed largely by a recovery in its manufacturing and industrial sectors thanks to strong government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports.

But property and construction activity, two of the economy's main growth drivers, are starting to slow under the weight of government measures to cool heated housing prices and higher borrowing costs.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted weekly index of mortgage activity was little changed at 389.7 in the week ended Nov. 3, compared with 389.8 the prior week. These were the weakest readings since 371.5 in the Feb. 17 week.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.18 percent from the previous week's 4.22 percent, which was the highest since July, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average interest rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were unchanged to 4 basis points lower than the prior week.
Home borrowing costs fell in step with bond yields in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's nomination last week of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to head the U.S. central bank. Powell, if confirmed, would succeed current chair Janet Yellen whose term expires in February.
Powell is seen as someone who would continue the Fed's current approach to gradually raising interest rates and shrinking the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Bond yields had spiked in October partly on worries Trump would select a candidate such as Stanford University economist John Taylor who is perceived to hold a hawkish view on monetary policy.
Benchmark yields have also retreated from their seven-month high after an October payrolls report that showed wage growth stalled and due to uncertainty over a Republican-sponsored bill aimed at overhauling the federal tax code.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of purchase mortgage activity, a proxy for future home sales, rose 0.5 percent from a six-week low to 1,290.8.
The group's seasonally adjusted index of mortgage refinancing activity dipped 0.5 percent to 1,290.8, the lowest since early July.
The share of refinancing requests of total applications grew to 49.0 percent from 48.7 percent the previous week.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2017 05:44AM ET</span>",UK firms to offer higher pay as Brexit deters EU workers,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British employers are having to raise their pay offers in the face of growing recruitment problems, two surveys showed on Wednesday, following a fall in the number of European Union workers since the Brexit vote.
Stronger pay growth would ease a big problem for Britain's economy -- wages lagging inflation -- and could add to the case for further interest rates hikes by the Bank of England, which last week raised rates for the first time since 2007.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said its monthly survey showed starting salaries rose in October at the second-quickest rate since November 2015.
""We already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,"" REC chief executive Kevin Green said. 
""We therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.""
Separately on Wednesday, the Bank of England said recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities.
The BoE report, based on the findings of its regional agents across the country, said companies expected pay settlements next year to offer increases of around 2.5–3.5 percent rather than the 2–3 percent range seen during 2017. 
Last week, the BoE predicted overall pay growth of around 3 percent next year, up from just over 2 percent this year.
Britain's official statistics agency said in August that net migration fell to its lowest level in three years with more than half the drop caused by European Union citizens leaving and fewer arriving since the Brexit vote.
REC said its survey, conducted with data firm IHS Markit, showed the availability of permanent and temporary workers continued to fall sharply last month.
Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in 10 years, in part because it expects the plunge in unemployment in Britain will soon start to push up wages.
The BoE also thinks slower growth in investment by businesses ahead of Brexit will aggravate a problem already facing Britain's economy: that it cannot grow as fast as before without generating extra inflation pressure.
In its regional agents report, the BoE said business investment would continue to grow at a modest pace over the next year before weaker increases over the following two years.
""Economic uncertainty was the biggest drag on investment plans,"" the BoE said on Wednesday, citing a survey of 375 firms.

""Expectations about future trading arrangements and other factors related to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, such as concerns around the future availability of overseas labor, were also reported to be restraining investment,"" it said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's economy is expected to have clocked solid growth in the third quarter, aided by improving retail sales, a pick-up in tourists from mainland China and strong global trade. 
The former British colony has seen brighter economic data in the past few months as buoyant stock and property markets helped boost consumer spending, prompting the government to raise its full-year growth outlook to 3-4 percent.
The economy is expected to have expanded 3.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with 3.8 percent in the previous quarter, according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Reuters. 
One analyst with a quarter-on-quarter forecast expects the economy to have grown a seasonally-adjusted 0.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with 1.0 percent growth in the April-June quarter. 
""The recent data relating to consumption and investment has been strong, such as retail sales and tourist numbers, and that supports our view of quite good growth in the upcoming (GDP) data,"" said Thomas Shik, acting chief economist at Hang Seng Bank. 
""We may revise up our full-year forecast if the Q3 data is as strong as we expect,"" added Shik, whose 2017 forecast now stands at 3.4 percent. 
Asian economies which are highly dependent on trade have benefitted this year from an improvement in global demand, although Hong Kong officials have warned the prospect of higher interest rates could weigh on the city's medium-term outlook. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warned in her maiden policy speech in October that the city faced ""grave"" challenges and must develop a more diversified economy. 
Her comments came as the city has seen its lucrative position as the world's gateway to China eroded as the mainland rapidly builds up its own ports, airlines and financial powerhouses, and opens its markets to foreign investors. 
A pick-up in the number of visitors from mainland China helped Hong Kong's retail sales grow at the fastest annual pace in more than 30 months in September. 
Further underpinning growth have been record high property prices, which are among the most expensive in the world, and a stock market (HSI) that has surged more than 30 percent so far this year to close at its highest in a decade this week.
With its economy closely tied to its giant northern neighbour, Hong Kong has also gained from buoyant trading and manufacturing activities linked to China's resilient economic activity this year.
Hong Kong's exports in September rose 9.4 percent from a year earlier, its eighth consecutive month of gains.

The trade data also showed China's goods surplus with the United States, historically a sore spot in relations between the two nations, narrowed last month as investors awaited U.S. President Donald Trump's arrival in Beijing later in the day.
Trade and North Korea are expected to feature prominently in discussions between Trump and President Xi Jinping, who is driving broad economic reforms by opening up China's capital markets, targeting corruption and reducing high levels of debt in an effort to foster sustainable growth.
""Continued solid exports to the U.S. may add to U.S.-China trade tensions,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, wrote after the data was released. 
October exports rose 6.9 percent from a year earlier in dollar terms, slightly lagging analysts' forecast of a 7.2 percent increase, compared to 8.1 percent growth in September, official data showed on Wednesday. 
Imports grew 17.2 percent year-on-year in October, beating forecast of 16.0 percent growth but slightly slower than the 18.7 percent rise in September.
Taken together, analysts say, the numbers reinforced recent signs of a cooling in economic momentum as the war on smog and tighter rules to reduce China's years-long addiction to debt drags on overall activity.
Trump's visit and the potential for further trade tension come as China also faces a long-term challenge to rebalance its economy from a reliance on investment and exports toward domestic consumption. 
Trump has railed against China's massive trade surplus with the U.S., criticizing Beijing for not playing by the rules.
The latest data showed shipments to the United States rose 8.3 percent on-year in October, while imports increased 4.3 percent. That resulted in $26.62 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last month, based on Reuters calculations of official data, down from a record $28.08 billion in September. 
But the surplus was still above recent trends and could keep trade tensions high, analysts say. 
After Trump returns from Asia, ""the U.S. administration will remain eager to show results of some kind on the trade deficit. This could include more protectionist measures against Chinese exports,"" said Kuijs, who estimates China's surplus with the U.S. will rise to $370 billion this year from $347 billion in 2016. 
INDUSTRIAL COMMODITIES HIT
The nation's overall trade surplus for October was $39.17 billion, according to a Reuters calculation of data from the Administration of Customs.
Expectations centered on a surplus of $39.5 billion versus September's $28.61 billion.
China's economy has recorded better-than-expected growth of nearly 6.9 percent through the first nine months of this year, thanks to strong government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports.
But momentum has started to fade and analysts say the weaker trade partly reflect moderating external demand. 
The data comes amid expectations of a renewed effort by policy makers to reduce debt risks and tighten rules to bring polluting factories to heel. The numbers mirror cooling growth in China's manufacturing sector, pointing to slackening demand at home and abroad.
China's iron ore imports fell nearly 23 percent in October from record levels the previous month, with steel mills cutting output as part of a government drive against pollution.
Steel exports fell 3 percent on-month to 4.98 million tonnes last month, hitting their lowest since February, 2014, data showed.
The data could have been impacted by a longer holiday in October this year, which resulted in fewer working days, though the overall trend is of cooling foreign trade. 
""The big picture is that both outbound and inbound shipments have softened recently, a trend that continued last month,"" Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 
""We suspect that this reflects a slight easing of growth in other emerging markets along with weaker domestic demand as a result of slower infrastructure spending.""
At the recently-concluded Communist Party Congress Xi emphasized quality over speed in fostering sustainable growth, while reinforcing a pledge to win the war on pollution and clamp down on riskier types of lending.

Even with some loss of momentum in the fourth quarter, the country's economic growth is still expected to easily meet or beat the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Argentine President Mauricio Macri said his government would definitely appeal to the World Trade Organization if the U.S. Commerce Department followed through on threatened duties on Argentine biodiesel.
""I can assure you (U.S. Commerce) Secretary (Wilbur) Ross is doing his best to find an agreement with the U.S. private sector,"" Macri told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. ""Still we didn't find it but I'm still optimistic.""
Macri, though, replied in the affirmative when asked whether his government would go to the WTO to contest the duties if they were confirmed at the preliminary level of as much as 64.17 percent.
The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to make a decision setting final antidumping duties on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel, which threatens to price its exports of the primarily soy-based fuel out of the U.S. market.
Argentina has been trying to settle the trade dispute by negotiating a minimum price for its exports, but no deal has yet been reached.
Macri, who reached out to U.S. President Donald Trump soon after he was elected in a bid to rekindle a relationship they formed as businessmen before entering politics, portrayed the dispute as one between private industries rather than governments.
The Argentine president, who has made signing trade deals a priority, said he was optimistic that Mercosur, the trade bloc formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, would be able to conclude a free trade deal with the European Union by year-end despite differences over beef and other agribusiness matters.
""I feel that the European Union is really committed to finding an agreement with Mercosur,"" he said, predicting that a deal could be signed at the WTO Ministerial Conference scheduled to happen in Buenos Aires in early December. ""They know they need some good news after Brexit.""
Macri, who is wrapping up a two-day visit to the United States during which he met with executives from companies including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and DowDuPont Inc predicted the Argentine economy would grow ""a little more than 3 percent"" in 2017.
""Yes, I am optimistic,"" he said. ""Everyone says 2.8 percent, I say a little more than 3 percent.""

Macri, whose Cambiemos coalition coasted to a sweeping victory in mid-term elections last month, acknowledged that if his forecast came true his government would likely have to make payments on debt linked to the country's economic performance.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2017 01:50AM ET</span>",Japan Sept price-adjusted wages down for fourth straight month,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wages fell 0.1 percent in September from a year earlier after adjustment for inflation, down for the fourth straight month, suggesting consumer inflation could take a hit as salaries fail to keep pace with rising prices.
The decline, announced by the labor ministry on Tuesday, comes despite persistent calls by the government for companies to boost salaries to help drive economic activity.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose 0.9 percent compared with the same month last year, accelerating from 0.7 percent growth in August and marking the fastest rise since July 2016.
Tepid wage growth is a thorn in the side of the central bank, which has been asserting that the tightest job market in four decades will push up wages -- leading to stronger consumer spending and eventually its target rate of 2 percent inflation.
Many companies remain reluctant to spend their record cash reserves on wage hikes out of fear they will not be able to pass on the costs to customers who are accustomed to years of mostly falling prices.
In response, the government is considering expanding tax breaks for companies that raise wages, to achieve a 3 percent increase in overall salaries, sources have told Reuters.
Special payments, which includes bonuses, climbed 11.6 percent year-over-year in September, the data showed.
Regular pay, which determines base wages, rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, inched up 0.9 percent.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

Retail sales values slid by an annual 1.0 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, compared with a 1.9 percent rise in September.
Another survey from payments company Barclaycard (L:BARC) also showed weak consumer spending, with a similar split between spending on essentials at the cost of spending on discretionary items.
Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years. [nL8N1N85LO]
Most economists polled by Reuters before the decision thought a hike would be a mistake in part because of the fragile state of consumer finances, pressured by the rise in inflation since last year's Brexit vote.
The BRC said its figures were a cause for concern ahead of the Christmas holidays. ""The decline was driven by the worst performance of non-food sales since our record began in January 2011,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive.
""The growth in food sales meanwhile, adds some color to this otherwise anemic picture, but these figures are very much buoyed by inflation.""
Consumer price inflation hit 3 percent in September, its highest level in more than five years and above the BoE's 2 percent target.
The BRC, whose figures are not seasonally adjusted, said total sales last month edged up 0.2 percent, which was also the weakest increase for any October since 2008.
Dickinson said the last week's rate hike - the first in more than a decade - would add more pressure on household budgets.
Barclaycard's measure of consumer spending growth eased to 2.4 percent year-on-year, compared with an increase of 3 percent in September.
""In light of the Bank of England's announcement last week, it'll be interesting to see how shoppers, who have so far demonstrated their resilience, continue to juggle the many demands on their budget,"" said Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2017 06:40PM ET</span>","Australia's low inflation likely overstated, rate rise ever more distant","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian's already anaemic inflation rate looks set to be revised lower as changing spending habits by consumers are taken into account, further pushing out the day when interest rates might rise from record lows.
A five-year update of household spending patterns issued on Monday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) implied the consumer price index (CPI) was overstating inflation by around 0.22 percentage points.
That might not sound like much, but annual inflation was already surprisingly low at 1.8 percent in the third quarter and, crucially, short of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target band of 2 percent to 3 percent.
The new weights for the CPI suggested inflation was actually only 1.6 percent last quarter. 
""It is clear is that the reweighting of the CPI will make it increasingly hard for the RBA to hit its inflation target in the medium term,"" said Westpac economist Justin Smirk.
""The Australian economy just does not have the inflationary impulse in the sectors that are inflating to offset the disinflationary pressures that dominate the consumer retailing space.""
That would be a setback for the RBA which had forecast CPI inflation would rise to around 2 percent by the end of this year and increase gradually thereafter.
Investors have already pushed out the timing of any hike in the current 1.5 percent cash rate. The futures market is now not fully pricing in a move until early 2019 <0#YIB:>, a marked change from a couple of months ago when it was implying a hike by August 2018.
The central bank holds its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and is considered certain to stay on hold. It may also foreshadow its quarterly policy review due on Friday, which analysts suspect will include a downgrade to the inflation outlook.
""We remain comfortable with our below-consensus CPI outlook, with the reweighting impact seeing both headline and underlying CPI only slowly drift higher in the coming year to 2 percent or slightly above,"" said George Tharenou, an economist at UBS.
""This keeps the RBA on hold until the second half of 2018.""
The adjustments follow a re-weighting of the goods and services contained in the CPI to reflect how spending patterns have changed over the past five years.
In particular, consumers over time tend to substitute toward items that have become relatively less expensive, and away from items that have become more expensive.
This substitution effect typically leads to downward revisions in the CPI.
The trend had been highlighted by the central bank just last month. In a speech on uncertainty, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle noted history suggested CPI inflation tended to be overstated by around 0.25 percentage point and policy was set to take account of that.
The RBA has made it clear the next move in rates will likely be upward, but not for some time to come.

It has also resisted pressure for a further easing, fearing a cut would merely stoke a borrowing binge in the housing market that might ultimately turn into a bust.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>",North American commercial property insurance rates seen rising sharply in 2018,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - North American commercial property insurance rates could rise by as much as 25 percent during 2018 for properties that suffered catastrophe losses this year, according to a report on Monday by insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson (N:WTW).
The commercial property insurance market, which has been soft during recent years, is now heading toward a correction, largely due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which together triggered one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in history, Willis Towers Watson said.
Rates for commercial properties that were not damaged, but located in catastrophe-prone areas, may increase between 10 and 20 percent, while the cost of coverage for properties in other locations could increase by up to 5 percent, Willis Towers Watson said.
Insurers around the globe are looking to raise rates after what is likely to have been their most costly quarter on record. American International Group Inc (N:AIG) said on Friday it would pursue double-digit rate increases and bolster reinsurance, following $3 billion in third-quarter catastrophe losses.
Hurricanes Irma and Maria alone caused as much as $135 billion in insured losses, according to modeling firm AIR Worldwide. Earthquakes in Mexico could cost billions more.
Other insurers pursuing rate increases include the Travelers Companies Inc (N:TRV) and Chubb Ltd (N:CB).
""The marketplace is going to react, and buyers need to be ready,"" Willis Towers Watson wrote in the report. Insurers will have a clearer sense of their losses when policy renewals begin next year, the company said.
Auto liability rates may increase between 3 and 8 percent as insurers continue to ratchet up rates because of higher accident rates due to distracted driving and rising costs to fix damaged vehicles, Willis Towers Watson said. 

Most buyers of cyber insurance, which covers certain damages if a company is hacked, will face modest increases when they renew, triggered by growth in the sector. ""The cleanest risks may still see low single-digit decreases,"" the report said.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2017 11:50AM ET</span>","Brazil inflation likely picks up in October, nears government target","By Bruno Federowski
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's consumer price index likely rose in October at its fastest pace in eight months, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, easing concerns that it could end the year below the official target.
The official IPCA index  likely increased 0.47 percent from September, according to the median of 32 economist forecasts that ranged between 0.30 percent and 0.53 percent. The report is scheduled to be published on Friday at 9:00 a.m. local time (1100 GMT). 
Food prices are close to stabilizing after falling for months due to a record harvest, helping curb downward pressures on inflation from a slow economic recovery. Meanwhile, scarce rains drove regulators to hike electricity rates in a bid to offset reduced hydropower generation.
That would lift the annual inflation rate to 2.75 percent in October, the survey showed, below the 3 percent bottom-end of the official target range but far above 18-year lows seen earlier this year. 
An uptick would add evidence to a wider trend, after indices showed producer prices nationwide and prices in Brazil's largest city of São Paulo accelerating in recent months.
It would also assuage concerns that inflation could end the year below the bank's target, and could bump up 2018 forecasts, which stand below the 4.5 percent mid-point of the target range.
StarMine's SmartEstimate, which weighs estimates according to past precision, was slightly above the median forecast for the first time in three months.
Banco J. Safra, the most accurate forecaster of monthly inflation figures in Reuters polls, raised its estimate for 2018 inflation to 4.1 percent from 3.8 percent, due to the outlook for higher-than-expected power tariff hikes.
In a report, Safra economists led by Carlos Kawall wrote that lower-than-average rains in the first quarter of 2018 are likely to force the hand of regulators, driving inflation up by nearly 20 basis points.
That should not prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates to all-time lows in coming months, as it faces subdued wage growth and abundant idle capacity.

A weekly central bank survey of economists put the benchmark Selic interest rate at 7 percent by year-end 2018. The top five most precise estimates, however, suggest the central bank could cut it as low as 6.5 percent in February, after leaving the door open for further reductions.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's economy is on track for a strong finish to 2017 and firms are passing on more of their costs to consumers as pricing power increased, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone fell to 56.0 in October last month from September's 56.7, pipping an earlier flash estimate of 55.9 and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The final euro area PMI was revised up marginally from the flash to leave euro area growth looking healthy at the beginning of Q4,"" said Cathal Kennedy at RBC Capital Markets.
Earlier figures showed growth remained solid in Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies, but slowed in Italy, suggesting a recent flurry in economic activity there may be petering out.
Growth in Spain's key services sector fell to its lowest in nine months as the political crisis in Catalonia weighed heavily on business sentiment.
But with the euro zone enjoying a brisk economic recovery after years of stagnation, an investor sentiment index beat analyst expectations and climbed to its highest level since July 2007 in November, research group Sentix said on Monday.
IHS Markit said the PMIs point to euro zone economic growth of 0.6-0.7 percent in the closing quarter of 2017, better than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month. [ECILT/EU]
New orders growth accelerated despite firms increasing their prices at the joint fastest rate since the middle of 2011. The output price index rose to a seven-month high of 53.1 from 52.7.
More expensive energy and intermediate goods pushed up euro zone prices at factory gates more than expected in September, data from the European Union's statistics office showed on Monday.
""Some price rises merely reflect the pass-through of higher costs, but companies are also reporting stronger pricing power as demand conditions continue to improve, which suggests underlying inflationary pressures are becoming more engrained,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Robust growth alongside increasing price pressures will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who last month took a step toward weaning the euro zone off loose money.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 55.0 from 55.8, ahead of a preliminary reading of 54.9 and offsetting the strongest month in almost seven years for manufacturers.

But indicating they expect activity to increase, firms took on staff at the second fastest rate in nearly 10 years. The employment index jumped to 54.2 from 53.7.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2017 04:34AM ET</span>",China Oct data to show economy resilient even as momentum fades slightly,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - A burst of Chinese data over the next few weeks is expected to show the world's second-biggest economy cooled further in October as policy makers harden efforts to reduce financial risks and foster long term sustainable growth.
That strategy was amplified at the recently-concluded Communist Party Congress by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who set the tone for policy by emphasizing quality over quantity in boosting economic growth and pledging to win the war on pollution. 
While the government splurged on infrastructure projects, keeping fiscal policy fairly loose and stoking surprisingly strong growth through the year, authorities have also ramped up efforts to reduce China's years-long addiction to debt.
""We expect growth to slow in October,"" said Wendy Chen, an economist for Nomura in Shanghai. 
Chen expects the gradual slowdown to extend through to the end of the year as pollution curbs hit factory output and weaker property and infrastructure spending cool investment growth.
Indeed, growth in factory output is seen slowing to 6.3 percent year-on-year in October from September's 6.6 percent, according to a Reuters poll of 32 economists. 
The war on pollution was partly to blame for third quarter growth cooling slightly to 6.8 percent, from the first half's 6.9 percent.
Yet those numbers defied market expectations for a sharper slowdown this year, as the government-backed construction boom drove up prices from cement to steel and glass in a boost to overall economic output. 
And October data is again expected to show growth will easily hit Beijing's 6.5 percent target for 2017 as surging profits see factories expanding output, albeit at a slower pace, and resilient consumer spending supports broad activity.
Policymakers could face a delicate balancing act over the next year, analysts say, as they target high-risk lending to firms and the property sector, while taking long-overdue steps to bring polluting factories to heel.
There are some mixed signals about how strict this winter's anti-pollution measures will actually be. 
A government official on Tuesday said pollution measures in October hurt output at some firms, which was reflected in an official survey of the sector, while iron ore futures prices rose on Friday after production cuts at steel plants appeared to be less than expected. 
Fixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.4 percent in the Jan-Oct period, down slightly from a 7.5 percent rise in the first three quarters of the year. 
Retail sales growth is seen edging up to 10.4 percent on-year from 10.3 percent the previous month.
Industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail sales data are set to be published on Nov. 14.
TRUMP AND TRADE
China is set to announce October trade data on Wednesday, the same day United States President Donald Trump arrives in Beijing for his first visit to China.
Trump has railed against China's massive trade surplus with the U.S., and bilateral trade is set to feature prominently in discussions.
China's trade surplus with the U.S. in September was the highest ever for any single month, based on Reuters calculations of official data going back to 2008, even as its overall surplus narrowed.
Economists expect China's exports to have risen 7.2 percent on-year in October, slower than 8.1 percent the previous month, while imports may have jumped 16.0 percent, producing a trade surplus of $39.5 billion. 
LOAN GROWTH TO SLOW
The governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan in comments over the weekend again warned about the risk from high leverage in China's financial system, saying that China must prevent ""black swan"" events, which refers to major, unexpected occurrences. 
Worries about a rapid build-up in China's debt prompted S&P Global Ratings to downgrade China's sovereign credit rating in September, following a cut by Moody's in May. 
China has mostly put the brakes on a buildup in corporate debt this year. Regulators have now also zoomed in on the risks from disguised property debt as investors look for ways around rules.
Economists expect that new loans in October dropped to a one-year low of 780 billion yuan ($117.59 billion) as banks restrict mortgage lending and corporates continue to shun bank loans.
Despite government rhetoric about the deleveraging drive, bank lending would have to drop sharply from this year's trend for new loans not to surpass last year's total and reach a new high. 
The producer price index (PPI) is tipped to have risen 6.6 percent in October on-year, down from 6.9 percent in September when prices spiked on concerns supply would be short due to winter production restrictions. 
The consumer price index (CPI) meanwhile is seen up 1.8 percent on-year in October, versus 1.6 percent in September.
China's foreign exchange reserves are expected to have risen for a ninth month to $3.118 trillion in October, as capital curbs and a weakening dollar helped staunch fund outflows.

China is due to announce foreign exchange reserves data on Nov. 7, followed by trade and inflation data on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from Nov. 10 to Nov. 15.

LONDON (Reuters) - Most European businesses plan to cut back orders from British suppliers because of the slow progress of Brexit talks, a survey of company managers showed on Monday.
Sixty-three percent of non-British European companies expect to move some of their supply chain out of Britain, up from 44 percent in May, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) said.
With only 17 months left until Britain is due to exit the European Union, the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears among executives of an abrupt departure with no transition.
Monday's survey raised the prospect of disruption for British manufacturers with EU clients.
On Sunday, the Confederation of British Industry said almost two in three British firms will have implemented Brexit contingency plans by March if Britain and the rest of the EU have not struck a transitional deal by then.
Britain and the EU said last week they were ready to speed up talks, but CIPS said it was already too late for scores of businesses that look likely to be dropped by European customers.
""British businesses simply cannot put their suppliers and customers on hold while the negotiators get their act together,"" said Gerry Walsh, CIPS' group chief executive officer.
""The lack of clarity coming from both sides is already shaping the British economy of the future - and it does not fill businesses with confidence.""
British finance minister Philip Hammond said last month that a transition deal needed to be struck by early 2018.
CIPS said a fifth of British businesses were struggling to secure contracts that extend beyond March 2019, the date Britain is due to leave the EU.
Its survey also added to signs that the pound's plunge after last year's Brexit vote did more harm than good to Britain's economy. Nearly two-thirds of firms said the fluctuations had raised the cost of managing their supply chains. 
Hammond is under pressure to help British businesses as he readies his Nov. 22 annual budget.
Manufacturing association EEF urged him to take measures that will boost Britain's patchy investment performance.
""The chancellor has to offset acute anxiety among companies over Brexit with a budget that reassures business the government will deliver a comprehensive and ambitious industrial strategy,"" said EEF chief executive Terry Scuoler.
EEF recommended that Hammond should boost capital allowances and tax credits for research and design in British companies.

The CIPS survey of 1,118 supply chain managers was conducted between Sept. 4 to Oct. 5. A total of 106 EU-based businesses with British supply chains took part in the survey.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies remained at +11, its joint lowest level since June.
""Growth in the economy has remained relatively stable, although the pace of growth was a little slower than expected, particularly for retailers and manufacturers,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 although it picked up a bit of pace in the third quarter.
The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday as it moved to head off what it sees as the inflationary impact of Brexit, even as it said economy will probably remain stuck in a slow gear over the next three years.
Output expectations for the next three months fell to +12 from +18 in September, the weakest reading since January. 
The CBI said it expected growth to remain modest as inflation eats further into household spending power in late 2017 and early 2018 and uncertainty about Brexit dampens business investment next year.

""We still expect more support to growth from net trade than has been the case in the recent past, as a lower exchange rate and firm global growth lift UK exports and softer domestic demand bears down on import growth,"" it said.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 10:33AM ET</span>","U.S. job growth speeds up, unemployment rate falls; wages flat","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but a sharp retreat in annual wage gains and surge in the number of people dropping out of the work force cast a cloud over the labor market. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists' expectations for an increase of 310,000 jobs. 
Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported. Some aspects of the report, however, were downbeat. 
Average hourly earnings slipped by one cent, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part because of the return of the lower-paid industry workers. That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent, which was the smallest since February 2016. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September, lifting the annual increase in that month to 2.9 percent. 
Still, October's job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve's assessment on Wednesday that ""the labor market has continued to strengthen,"" and probably does little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank has lifted rates twice this year. 
""The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,"" said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. ""Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.""
Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise jump of 575,000 in September.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data. The dollar (DXY) gained against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street were largely flat.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.
Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. Last month's one-tenth percentage point drop in the unemployment rate took it to its lowest reading since December 2000. The jobless rate is now below the Fed's median forecast for 2017.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month, the lowest level since December 2006, from 8.3 percent in September.
Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed's 2 percent target and could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year. 
The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. Growth has remained strong even as President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program. 
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday unveiled a bill that proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks. The plan has been met with opposition from small businesses, realtors and homebuilders.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports. Exports, which were the highest since December 2014, are being buoyed by a weakening dollar and strong global growth.
Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers' difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.
Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs. The retail sector lost 8,300 jobs last month.

Construction payrolls gained 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes. There were increases in professional and business services payrolls. Healthcare employment also rose last month.

Factory goods orders increased 1.4 percent as demand for a range of goods rose, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Orders increased by an unrevised 1.2 percent in August.
Economists had forecast factory orders increasing 1.3 percent in September. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -seen as a measure of business spending plans - surged 1.7 percent in September instead of the 1.3 percent increase reported last month. September's increase in these so-called core capital goods orders was the largest since July 2016. 
Orders for core capital goods rose 1.4 percent in August. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.9 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent rise.
The Commerce Department said it was unable to isolate the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the data as the survey is ""designed to estimate the month-to-month change in manufacturing activity at the national level and not at specific geographic areas.""
Strong business spending on equipment is helping to underpin manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing is also being buoyed by a weakening U.S. dollar, replenishing of business inventories and strengthening global demand. Business investment in equipment has contributed to GDP growth for four straight quarters. 
Spending is rising despite signs of slowing oil and gas drilling as ample supplies curb crude oil price increases. 
In September, orders for machinery gained 0.1 percent after being unchanged in August. Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders rebounded 17.8 percent after tumbling 7.5 percent in August.

Orders for transportation equipment rose 4.7 percent, reflecting a 30.8 percent jump in civilian aircraft orders. Motor vehicle orders edged up 0.1 percent after accelerating 2.5 percent in August.

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) increased to 60.1 in October from the prior month’s reading of 59.8.
Economists had expected the index to fall to 58.5.
October's reading was the highest since the index debuted in 2008, said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management.
""The non-manufacturing sector has reflected the third consecutive month of strong growth,"" he said. ""Respondent comments continue to indicate a positive outlook for business conditions, and the economy as we begin the fourth quarter.""
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index increased to 62.2 last month, compared to 61.3 in September.
The  New Orders Index  registered 62.8 in October, down from the reading of 63.0 in the previous month.
The Employment Index rose to 57.5 last month from September’s reading of 56.8.
The ISM Non-manufacturing Prices Index slumped to 62.7 from the prior month’s reading of 66.3.
Following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1626 compared to 1.1641 ahead of the release, while GBP/USD was at 1.3090from 1.3096. The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was at 94.70 compared to 94.62 prior to the report.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion. August's trade deficit was revised up to $42.8 billion from the previously reported $42.4 billion. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall rising to $43.2 billion in September. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit was little changed at $62.2 billion. 
Trade added 0.41 percentage points to the economy's 3.0 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter. It was the third straight quarterly contribution to gross domestic product.
The department said while it could not isolate the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on the trade data, the effects were ""embedded in source data."" 
In September, exports of goods and services increased 1.1 percent to $196.8 billion, the highest level since December 2014. Goods exports were also the highest since December 2014, while exports of services hit a record high. 
There were increases in exports of industrial supplies and materials. Exports of consumer goods, however, declined. Exports to China fell 1.1 percent.
Imports of goods and services increased 1.2 percent to $240.3 billion in September. Food imports were the highest on record as were those of capital goods. Imports of non-petroleum imports were the highest since March 2015.

Imports of goods from China slipped 0.8 percent. As a result, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 0.7 percent to $34.6 billion in September.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 261,000 in October, compared to the creation of just 18,000 posts a month earlier that was revised up from the initial decline of 33,000.
The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 310,000 jobs but showed the recovery in the U.S. labor from the effect of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September.
On a positive note, the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 4.1%, from 4.2%
Average hourly earnings showed no change month-on-month in October, below forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior 0.5% increase.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.4% in October, compared to forecasts for a 2.7% rise and the prior month’s 2.8% advance that was revised from an initial 2.9% increase.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer of the new job contracts than expected in October with a total of 252,000, compared to consensus expectations for 303,000. September’s number was revised to an increase of 15,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of the destruction of 40,000 jobs.
Government payrolls increased by 9,000 last month, compared to the 3,000 public jobs created in September, revised from an initial increase of 7,000 positions.
The participation rate unexpectedly fell to 62.7% in October from the prior 63.1%. Analysts had expected no change.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, fell to 7.9% from the September’s reading of 8.3%.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours held stable at 34.4 in in October, in line with expectations.

MADRID (Reuters) - Registered unemployment rose sharply in Catalonia in October, data showed on Friday, with more people signing on as jobless in the region than anywhere else in Spain as companies fled in the midst of the country's worst political crisis in decades. 
Almost 2,000 companies based in Catalonia moved their legal headquarters out of the region in October after an independence vote banned by Madrid that led to the central government sacking regional authorities and taking control. 
The number of people in Spain registering as jobless rose for the third straight month by 1.67 percent in October from a month earlier, or by 56,844 people, leaving 3.47 million people out of work, data from the Labour Ministry showed.
Of that, Catalonia saw unemployment rise by 3.67 percent, or 14,698 people, the largest loss of jobs amongst all the regions and compared to a just 0.08 percent rise in jobless in the region of Madrid. 
The Bank of Spain warned on Thursday that uncertainty due to the independence drive, if it persists, could lead to slower economic growth and lower job creation in the next few months.
October often sees a continuation of rising unemployment after the summer tourist sector lays off temporary workers in hotels and restaurants. 
Registered jobless rose strongest in the service sector, with a 2.2 percent monthly rise, or by 50,885 people, followed by agriculture, marking the end of summer harvests, up 5.83 percent, or 9,194 people. 
In Spain, the number of people paying in to the social security system as workers in Spain rose by 94,368 people, to 18.43 million people, the ministry said.
In seasonally adjusted terms, Spain's registered unemployed fell by 23,690 people in October from a month earlier.

Spain's unemployment rate, taken from a wide survey of the workforce a considered a more accurate representation of the country's unemployed than the monthly figure, fell to its lowest since 2008 in the third quarter at 16.38 percent.

The IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 55.6 in October from 53.6 in September, its highest level since April and its biggest one-month rise since August 2016.
The reading exceeded all forecasts in a Reuters poll and moved further above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The services survey follows relatively upbeat PMI readings for the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors in October, and taken together they suggest the economy is growing at a quarterly rate of 0.5 percent, IHS Markit said.
This is stronger than the 0.4 percent recorded in official data for the three months to September and, if sustained, suggests annual growth will rise from the four-year low of 1.5 percent recorded in the second and third quarters of 2017.
But businesses are unsure about the outlook, and optimism among services companies remained well below its long-run average, fueled mainly by uncertainty over Brexit, the PMI data showed.
""While an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England' decision to hike interest rates ... a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMIs.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday that the central bank's next move would be heavily influenced by the progress of talks on Britain's departure from the European Union.
Growth could get a boost if a transitional deal gave businesses confidence to invest.
But a fall in the pound if there was a failure to reach a deal could intensify inflation pressure.
Friday's survey showed inflation pressures remained firm.
The services PMI, which covers non-retail businesses, said firms were putting up prices at the fastest rate since April.
Costs increased rapidly, though at the slowest rate in just over a year, possibly tallying with the BoE's view that the inflationary effect of last year's more than 10 percent fall in the value of the pound is starting to fade.
Across the economy as a whole, the PMI showed that job creation was at its weakest since March.
""Squeezed margins and concerns about the economic outlook had led to more cautious hiring strategies,"" IHS Markit said.

1229,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 05:36AM ET</span>",UK Services Sector Shows Upbeat Start to 4th Quarter,"Investing.com - The UK services sector expanded at a faster rate than expected in October, easing concerns over the economy and showing a positive start to the fourth quarter.
Research group IHS Markit reported that its Purchasing Managers’ Index for the UK services sector, the UK's largest, rose to 55.6 in October, the fastest rate for six months.
Economists had predicted a reading of 53.3, cooling from September’s 53.6.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The PMI reading from the UK’s biggest sector completes a hat-trick of better than expected PMI data from the UK this week. The manufacturing and construction sectors also expanded at a faster rate than expected.
UK manufacturing PMI rose to 56.3 in October from an upwardly revised 56.0 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 55.8.
Meanwhile the construction sector, which had contracted in September, unexpectedly returned to growth in October. It was expected to remain flat with a reading of 48.1, yet rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.8.
Despite the uptick in construction, confidence in the industry fell to its lowest level for almost five years.
In a bid to combat high inflation and prevent the UK economy from overheating, on Thursday the Bank of England increased interest rates for the first time since 2007. .
The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to hike the Bank Rate 0.25% to 0.50%, effectively reversing the rate cut that followed the Brexit referendum. The pound fell sharply on what was seen as a dovish move from the Bank.
The BoE said that any further hikes would be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, they also warned that Brexit is having a “noticeable impact on the economic outlook.”

The findings, along with other private and official business readings earlier in the week, are likely to reinforce views that the world's second-largest economy saw a more subdued start to the fourth quarter after racing ahead earlier in the year. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.2 in October, up slightly from September's 21-month low but suggesting only a subdued expansion in activity and new orders.
A reading above 50 indicates growth, and any lower signals deterioration on a monthly basis. The index had hit a three-month high in August.
An official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector on Tuesday showed slower but still relatively solid growth in October.
China's leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power that is being felt at home and abroad.
Unlike the official data, the Caixin survey tends to focus more on small and mid-sized companies, which have tended to be under greater strain than their larger, state-supported peers.
But one positive takeaway from the latest Caixin survey suggested smaller firms may be regaining some pricing power.
While their input costs for raw material, fuel and labor continued to rise, service providers were able to raise their prices at the quickest pace in over two years, protecting profit margins but also pointing to building inflationary pressures.
China's economy has surprised global financial markets and investors with robust growth of nearly 7 percent so far this year, driven by a renaissance in long-ailing ""smokestack"" industries such as steel.
But property and construction activity, two of the economy's main growth drivers, are starting to cool under the weight of government measures to cool heated housing prices and higher borrowing costs.
While growth in services took up much of that slack in the third quarter, manufacturing may face a sharper slowdown in coming months as the government orders many mills and factories in northeast China to curtail or halt production to reduce winter air pollution.
Reflecting the growing drag on manufacturing output, Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI for October
fell 0.4 points to 51.0 in October, the lowest since June 2016.
""The Caixin PMIs for October showed that the economy had a relatively weak start to the fourth quarter. However, monetary policy is unlikely to be loosened unless major downside risks emerge,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
China's official factory survey showed activity in energy-intensive and polluting industries slowed in October in the face of government's rigorous pollution measures.
At China's recently-concluded Communist Party Congress, President Xi Jinping said the country would pursue high-quality growth over high-speed growth while reinforcing a pledge to win the war on pollution and clamp down on riskier types of lending.
Even with some loss of momentum in the fourth quarter, China's economic growth is still expected to easily meet or beat the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent after a robust start to the year.
Analysts polled by Reuters last month forecast China's 2017 growth at 6.8 percent, before slowing to 6.4 percent in 2018 as the property curbs and a crackdown on debt risks gain more traction.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>","Australia retail sales lack momentum, could crimp economic growth","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retailers suffered another tepid month of sales as consumers, battling stagnant wages and rising utility bills, curbed spending in an outcome that augers poorly for third-quarter economic growth.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales were flat in September, a big surprise given analysts had looked for a bounce of 0.4 percent following a shock decline in August.
Sales fell in nominal terms in July and August, yet adjusted for inflation they still rose 0.1 percent for the whole third quarter. Essentially, retailers sold more goods but got less money for them.
The Australian dollar  skidded about 20 pips following the data to be down 0.3 percent at $0.7687, leaving behind a more than one-week high of $0.7729 set on Thursday.
Australia's retail sector had shown some signs of life earlier in the year, but that recovery was short-lived as sluggish wages and household incomes sapped spending power.
Friday's data implies a risk private consumption didn't add much to overall economic growth in the September quarter. It also casts a shadow on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) forecasts for the A$1.7 trillion economy to accelerate at a 3 percent pace over the next two years.
The RBA has long feared ballooning debt in Australia's red-hot property sector was limiting consumers' ability to spend elsewhere in the economy, one reason it has held rates at an all-time low 1.50 percent since August 2016.
The ABS figures showed hefty falls in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, with Tasmania and South Australia rebounding after losses the previous month. 
In chain volume measures, household goods and department stores led the declines, while food and clothing inched higher.
In a sign of the times, Australia's biggest department store operator Myer (AX:MYR) this week cut its growth targets after its quarterly sales fell 2.8 percent.
Other parts of the economy are in better shape.

Data out on Thursday showed dwelling approvals climbed to a seven-month high while Australia boasted its longest run of trade surpluses in over four decades.

DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks more than doubled in October compared with the same period in 2016, and strong orders should continue to bolster truck production into 2018, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Thursday.
Preliminary truck orders for October hit 35,700, up significantly from 13,674 in October 2016, according to FTR.
""The market continues to follow our expectations and highlights that the market fundamentals remain solid as we approach 2018,"" said Jonathan Starks, FTR's chief operating officer.
October marks the fifth consecutive month of rising truck orders. Truck orders slumped in 2017 amid high inventory levels and truck companies' concerns over the state of the economy.
Class 8 semi-trucks are the big rigs that haul most U.S. freight down the country's highways.
Truck order growth in 2018 could be fueled by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs next month. Experts predict many smaller truck firms that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop, benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles.
FTR said October's order growth was not evenly spread among all truck manufacturers.
The main truck makers in the U.S. market are  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV), PACCAR Inc (O:PCAR) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2017 01:52PM ET</span>",Bank of England takes slow lane after first rate hike since 2007,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years on Thursday but said it expected only ""very gradual"" further increases as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, sending sterling down sharply.
The BoE's nine rate-setters voted 7-2 to increase the Bank Rate to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent, reversing an emergency cut made in August 2016 after the Brexit vote.
It was the first BoE hike since 2007, before the global financial crisis tipped Britain into a deep recession.
However, investors focused on the BoE's wariness about its next moves, pushing down sterling by its most in five months against a basket of other major currencies (=GBP). The five-year gilt yield fell by the most since the day after the BoE cut rates last year.
The BoE did not repeat its previous warnings to markets that they were underestimating the extent of future rises.
That echoed the cautious approach taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to attempts to wean their economies off massive stimulus programmes.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said that in broad-brush terms, the central bank was on the same page as investors who expect two more 25 basis-point rate hikes before the end of 2020. 
Nonetheless, he cautioned investors not to be too relaxed as inflation was still on course to exceed the BoE's 2 percent target in three years' time.
""We in fact need those two additional rate increases in order to get that return of inflation to target,"" Carney told reporters. ""If you look closely at the forecast, inflation approaches the target, it doesn't quite get there, and the economy is likely to be in a position of excess demand."" 
Britain's economy slowed sharply this year after the Brexit vote in 2016, raising questions about the wisdom of raising rates now among many economists. 
But Carney fears that Brexit will aggravate Britain's weak productivity growth and make the economy more inflation-prone.
Carney said the Brexit talks were likely to be the biggest factor for the next BoE move on rates, either up or down.
He also said the sheer novelty of a first rate hike created some uncertainty about its impact on the economy, but there was no reason to expect this to be larger than normal.
Thursday's move meant the BoE followed through on its signal in September that a rate hike was coming. That may go some way to help counteract Carney's reputation - in the words of one British lawmaker - of being an ""unreliable boyfriend"" who did not live up to previous guidance about higher rates.
TIMING IT RIGHT?
The two Monetary Policy Committee members who voted to keep rates steady, deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, said wage growth was too weak to justify a rate rise now.
But the BoE said all nine MPC members backed its previous guidance that any future increases in the Bank Rate would be ""at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"".
The BoE said debt servicing costs paid by British households and companies remained ""historically very low"". 
UK Finance, representing major lenders, said 3.7 million people with variable-rate mortgages would pay an average of 13 pounds ($17) more a month for every 100,000 pounds of debt.
Economists polled by Reuters had overwhelmingly predicted a hike on Thursday, although nearly three-quarters of them thought it was too soon to make such a move.
""It's a bit of a gamble to hike at a time when the economy is stuttering and nobody knows which way the Brexit dice are going to roll,"" Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management, said.
Howard Archer of economics consultancy EY ITEM Club, predicted rates would rise again only in late 2018. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategist Pierre Bose said the BoE message increased the importance of the Brexit talks: ""Progress ... could drive bond yields higher and a rebound in sterling.""
BoE DILEMMA 
Thursday's vote split reflects the dilemma facing the BoE.
On the one hand, Britain's economy has grown slowly this year as a jump in inflation caused by the slump in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote pinched spending by consumers. Also, companies are offering sub-inflation pay rises to staff.
The central bank said the decision to leave the EU was already having a ""noticeable impact"" on the economic outlook.
But the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s and an expected improvement in lacklustre productivity growth suggested pay growth was about to rise, the BoE added.
The BoE said it expected inflation to have peaked at 3.2 percent in October. Inflation would only fall back to close to its 2 percent target if Bank Rate rose in line with the ""gently rising"" path implied in financial markets.
This would mean rates hit 1 percent by 2020, with a single quarter percentage-point rise likely next year.
The BoE stuck with its forecasts that Britain's economy would grow by 1.6 percent next year and by 1.7 percent in 2019.
Before the financial crisis, Britain's economy typically grew by more than 2 percent a year.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2017 11:47AM ET</span>",U.S. third quarter productivity fastest in three years; jobless claims fall,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity increased at its fastest pace in three years in the third quarter but the trend remained moderate, suggesting that a recent acceleration in economic growth was unlikely to be sustained.
Other data on Thursday showed the number of people filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-1/2-year low last week, offering further evidence that the labor market was tightening despite hurricane-related disruptions in September.
The surge in productivity last quarter held down growth in labor costs, indicating that inflation pressures could stay benign for a while. Still, jobs market strength bolsters the case for the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged on Wednesday.
""While the data point to a solid economy, they also reinforce the view that growth is not likely to remain strong for an extended period without improved wage gains,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Productivity is still growing too slowly.""
The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 3.0 percent annualized rate. That was the quickest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and followed an unrevised 1.5 percent rate in the April-June period.
The rise outpaced economists' expectations for a 2.4 percent pace and was flagged in last week's third-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 3.0 percent rate during that period.
Productivity increased at a 1.5 percent rate compared to the third quarter of 2016. Manufacturing productivity fell at a 5.0 percent rate last quarter, the steepest rate of decline since the first quarter of 2009.
Overall, worker productivity has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent from 2007 to 2016, below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016. This, together with slowing population growth indicate the economy's potential growth rate has declined. 
As such, analysts say the economy could struggle to achieve the 3 percent annual growth, which has been pledged by President Donald Trump. The Trump administration is pushing for big tax cuts and deregulation to achieve this goal. 
Congressional Republicans on Thursday called for a range of changes to the U.S. tax code, including slashing the corporate tax rate and reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the Republican tax reform proposal, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. U.S. stocks were little changed.
PRODUCTIVITY RISE UNSUSTAINABLE
Eight years into the recovery, annual GDP growth has not exceeded 3 percent and economists do not expect the acceleration in productivity to be sustained.
""Given how long the expansion has lasted, we are not especially hopeful for much firming in productivity during the coming years,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
With productivity rising in the last quarter, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at only a 0.5 percent pace after rising at a 0.3 percent pace in the April-June quarter. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2016, unit labor costs fell at a 0.1 percent rate, remaining negative for a second straight quarter. The weak growth in unit labor costs came despite hourly compensation rising at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. 
""This is a silver lining for corporations' bottom-lines that continue to benefit from contained labor costs despite the tightening in the labor market,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 for the week ended Oct. 28, the Labor Department said. That was not too far from 223,000, a 44-1/2-year low touched in mid-October. 
Last week marked the 139th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 7,250 to 232,500 last week. That was the lowest reading since April 1973.
The low level claims suggest a surge in job growth in October after nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September as Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government's closely watched employment report due on Friday will probably show that payrolls increased by 310,000 jobs in October.

Prices remain 2.5 percent higher than they were last October but are now 27 percent below the record high hit in February 2011.
Agricultural commodities have emerged from a highly volatile period and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has said it expects them to remain stable over the next decade. 
The FAO index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 176.4 points in October, down 1.3 percent from September.
Dairy prices were the biggest faller among the commodities measured in October, falling 4.2 percent as importers held back on purchases while awaiting new supplies while prices for skim milk powder were pushed down by low demand and ample stocks. 
Cereals markets are likely to be balanced in 2017-18, the FAO said, forecasting that global production would surpass last year's record harvest by a small margin, reaching 2.613 billion tonnes.
Total production of coarse grains is forecast to reach a record high, thanks to increases in South America and Southern Africa, and global rice output is set to be broadly stable. 

Wheat production, however, is due to decline by 1 percent from last year to 752.8 million tonnes, mainly because of a smaller harvest in the United States and an expected decline in Australia's crop, the FAO said.

LONDON Reuters) - Manufacturers in the euro zone had their strongest month since early 2011 in October as factories struggled to meet booming demand despite adding staff at the fastest rate in at least 20 years, a survey showed on Thursday.
""Euro zone factories started the fourth quarter with increased vigour, with the sector's growth spurt showing no sign of abating,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Economic growth in the currency bloc was a
faster-than-expected 0.6 percent last quarter and unemployment has fallen to an almost nine-year low, official data showed this week.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc rose to 58.5 last month from September's 58.1. That
was below a preliminary estimate of 58.6 but was its highest since February 2011 and the second-highest in over 17 years.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday, dipped to 58.8 from September's 6-1/2 year high
of 59.2 but remained well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. The flash estimate was 58.7. 
In a sign November will also be busy, new order growth accelerated at the fastest pace since early 2011 while factories built up backlogs of work at the joint-steepest rate since IHS Markit started monitoring it 15 years ago.
To try to meet growing demand, manufacturers took on staff rapidly, with the employment sub-index registering 57.3, up from 56.5 and the highest reading in its 20-year history.
""It's especially encouraging to see employment growing at a survey-record pace as firms seek to boost capacity in response
to fuller order books,"" Williamson said.
""Export order growth remains encouragingly solid, suggesting little impact from the strengthening of the euro this year, and

domestic demand continues to improve across the region.""
Robust growth alongside increasing price pressures will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who last
month took a step towards weaning the euro zone off loose money.

Data published by the Federal Labour Office showed the seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.495 million, a bigger drop than the 10,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
The unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent, the lowest level since reunification in 1990.
""The positive development on the labor market persists,"" Labour Office chief Detlef Scheele said in a statement. ""The strong upturn in the autumn has led to both unemployment and underemployment falling more strongly than usual.""
The healthy labor market should continue supporting a consumption-based growth cycle in Germany, contributing to rising tax revenues that will give the next government fiscal leeway to boost investment.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are trying to form a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens after an election in September.
The Greens want to boost investment in environmentally friendly technologies as well as infrastructure, digitalization and education. The FDP and conservatives prioritize tax cuts.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Lending curbs cooled home values in New Zealand last month, and pulled prices down in its biggest city Auckland for the first time in six years as investors braced for a further downturn in the face of the new government's planned ban on foreign homeowners.
Prices in the Auckland region, previously the epicenter of rapid house price inflation, fell 0.6 percent for the first annual fall since 2011, data from government valuer QV showed on Thursday.
Nationwide, growth eased to its slowest pace in five years at 3.9 percent in the year ending October, down from 4.3 percent the previous month, suggesting central bank restrictions are starting to tighten the screws on a market that sizzled at a red-hot pace over recent years.
A further downturn in the sector is on the cards, economists say, as the newly-appointed Labour government this week said it planned to implement a ban on foreign owners of existing homes by early 2018. That would form part of a series of measures to fix what Labour describes as a housing crisis.
""I think a slower housing market next year is a sure bet and that will have a short-term impact on consumer spending and therefore growth,"" said Dominick Stephens, chief economist at Westpac Bank.
An immigration boom, robust economic growth and low housing stock fanned hefty home price gains of more than 56 percent in the past decade.
Labour has said that it is implementing the ban on foreign speculators as a matter of principle but that it does not expect the restrictions to significantly dent house prices.
However, the leftwing government also plans to impose more stringent tax rules on local property investment and curb migration, which would see less people entering the country in need of houses.
Economists said that political uncertainty during the lead up to the election and coalition negotiations throughout September and October likely contributed to easing prices in the past few months.
Still, even before the Labour government took power this month the market had begun to run out of steam.
""In general there appears to be a trend of slowing in the rate of growth with the frenzy induced by high numbers of investors in the market subsiding and a return to more normal levels of activity in housing market around the country,"" said QV spokeswoman Andrea Rush, in an emailed statement.
Figures released by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand had also shown falls in Auckland in recent months and slowing growth throughout the year.
Though waning house values could drag on household confidence and economic growth it should bring some relief to the central bank which had been alarmed at the financial stability risk posed by the elevated market.

""To the extent that we've had quite a surge in house prices in recent years, some easing would be welcome by the Reserve Bank given the unaffordability of New Zealand housing,"" said Christina Leung, economist at think tank the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 10:28PM ET</span>","Australia keeps building homes, exporting goods in boon to economy","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approvals to build new homes in Australia climbed to a seven-month top in September while the country boasted its longest run of trade surpluses in over four decades, a promising omen for growth across the economy.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed total dwelling approvals rose 1.5 percent in September, confounding forecasts for a 1 percent fall.
Multi-unit apartments gained 2.3 percent while growth in private houses was robust too. Total approvals, at 18,849, were the highest since February, posting a remarkable turnaround after steady declines since mid-2016.
This means residential investment will continue to add to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the coming quarters, thanks to the healthy pipeline of construction.
Australia is in the midst of its biggest-ever home construction boom, already in its fifth year, boosting jobs and sales of everything from furniture to electronics.
All this supply is finally tempering house prices, which have been running especially hot in Sydney and Melbourne.
Home prices across the major cities went flat in October as Sydney suffered a second month of falls, as regulators' efforts to rein in investment lending continued to bite.
A similar tale of slowing house prices was seen across the Tasman, where New Zealand home values last month grew at their slowest pace in five years pressured by lending restrictions.
Housing is an important element of Australia's A$1.7 trillion economy, having added half a percentage point to growth in each of the last three years. Its health will determine where the economy, and interest rates, are headed.
The resilience of home building will likely be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has kept interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent for more than a year, waiting for inflation to show up.
TRADE SURPLUS
Separate figures out Thursday showed Australia's trade surplus doubled to A$1.75 billion ($1.35 billion) in September, handily beating market forecasts of A$1.2 billion. That was the eleventh straight month of surpluses, its longest winning stretch since the early 1970s.
Total exports climbed 2.9 percent in the month, led by gold and iron ore earnings, while imports dipped 0.2 percent.
Shipments of iron ore, the country's single biggest earner, were particularly strong in September mirroring record levels of imports by China.
As a result, Australia's total exports to China topped A$9 billion in September, an increase of 36 percent on the same month last year.
The ABS has already estimated that export prices fell 3 percent in the third quarter due to weakness in coal and iron ore, while prices for imports dropped 1.6 percent.

All of which implies volumes rose in the third quarter and net exports likely added to economic growth, perhaps by around a quarter of a percentage point.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 03:53PM ET</span>","Fed keeps rates unchanged, remains on road to December rate hike","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and pointed to solid U.S. economic growth and a strengthening labor market while playing down the impact of recent hurricanes, a sign it is on track to lift borrowing costs again in December.
Investors had all but ruled out a rate hike at the central bank's policy meeting this week and attention has largely been focused on who will be in charge of monetary policy at the end of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's first term in February 2018. 
President Donald Trump is set to announce his nomination on Thursday afternoon with Fed Governor Jerome Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen's gradual approach to raising rates, seen as having a lock on the job.
""The labor market has continued to strengthen and ... economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions,"" the Fed's rate-setting committee said in a statement after its unanimous policy decision.
In keeping with that encouraging tone, the central bank's policymakers acknowledged that inflation remained soft but did not downgrade their assessment of pricing expectations.
U.S. Treasury yields were largely unchanged after the release of the statement. The U.S. dollar pared gains against a basket of currencies and the S&P 500 index rose slightly.
""It confirms a December move,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""If we get a confirmation that Trump picks Powell tomorrow, it's a sign that monetary policy will continue on its current course that we have seen so far this year with gradual normalization.""
The Fed has raised rates twice this year and currently forecasts another nudge upwards in its benchmark lending rate from its current target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent by the end of 2017.
BALANCE SHEET REDUCTION
Fed policymakers have been buoyed in recent months by a stronger global and domestic economy and further tightening in the labor market, although they are divided over the causes and duration of the current weakness in inflation.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure sits at 1.3 percent after retreating further from the central bank's 2 percent target for much of the year. 
Nevertheless, Yellen and some other key policymakers have said the Fed still expects to continue to gradually raise rates given the strength of the overall economy. In its statement, the central bank reiterated it expects inflation to rise back to its target over the medium term and emphasized that the unemployment rate has declined further.
U.S. financial conditions remain loose, strengthening the argument that another rate rise would not slow the current brisk growth. The government reported last week that the economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
A decline in hiring in September has largely been dismissed as a blip caused by the temporary displacement of workers due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That jobs report showed wages growing at an improved pace and the unemployment rate falling to more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.
A strong rebound in job gains is anticipated when the Labor Department releases its October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
The Fed also said on Wednesday it was proceeding with the reduction of its $4.2 trillion in holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a process which began in October.
New Fed Governor Randal Quarles, Trump's first appointee to the central bank, voted at this week's policy meeting. The Republican president could fill at least three more open vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board in the coming months.

The central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. factory activity retreated from a 13-1/2-year high in October as some of the boost from hurricane-related supply disruptions faded, but continued to point to strengthening manufacturing conditions.
Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring in October, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed. 
Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The Fed said ""the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
""A good portion of the weakness this month was in supplier delivery times, which was a leader of strength the prior month,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago. ""From the Fed's perspective, continued improvement in domestic production offers additional support for an end-of-the-year rate hike.""
September's jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.
Longer supplier delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.
The survey's prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. While other components of the ISM index, including production, new orders and employment also fell last month, they remained at lofty levels.
Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar. Sixteen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in October.
Nearly all industries last month reported that hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida in late August and early September, continued to have an impact on supplies and raw material costs. The survey's measure of raw material inventories contracted in October. 
""Inventories were drawn down in the month, which is scored as a negative in the report but is really a positive since it creates the potential for future production increases to replenish inventory levels,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose marginally as did stocks on Wall Street. 
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.
The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody's Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It did, however, support expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.
""Hiring is strong and evidence continues to accumulate that the economy is beginning to gain momentum heading into year-end,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a jump in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

The data poses a small upside risk to the government's gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

The ADP National Employment Report said private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, exceeding a median forecast of 200,000 among economists polled by Reuters.
Domestic private payrolls in September were revised down to an increase of 110,000 from the previous 135,000. 
The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.
""This labor market is tight and is destined to be tighter,"" Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics chief economist said on a conference call with reporters.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 303,000 jobs in October, versus a drop of 40,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have increased by 312,000.
The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at 4.2 percent.

Zandi said the government's jobs readings in September and October would show larger swings than those from ADP because it uses a different method to count workers affected by the storms.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Soaring memory chip sales helped South Korea exports record 12 consecutive months of growth in October, evidence Asia's fourth largest economy is stepping up a gear. 
While shipments growth moderated from September, October outpaced September in terms of average exports per working day, highlighting brisk business activity. 
""October exports showed export fundamentals are still strong. Given that there was waning of the low-base effect, and only 18 working days, October fared well,"" said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities. 
Exports grew 7.1 percent on-year, far below bumper growth of 35 percent in September, but average exports per working day came in at $2.5 billion, outperforming September's $2.35 billion, government data showed on Wednesday.
South Korea celebrated the annual Chuseok holiday from Oct. 2 through Oct. 9, shortening the number of working days from 23.5 in September to 18. 
Asia's fourth-largest economy has been riding an unexpectedly robust export cycle on strong global demand for memory chips, which has cushioned some softness in private consumption. 
Exports to China jumped 13.5 percent from a year ago, posting double-digit growth for a third month in a row, as demand for intermediate goods including memory chips and petrochemical products remained strong. 
Shipments to the United States dropped 12 percent, as exports of cars and machines slowed, government data showed. 
Imports expanded 7.4 percent on-year, below analysts' forecasts of 11.5 percent and also moderating from 22.6 percent growth in September. 
A separate government report showed inflation moderated in October to the slowest pace in 10 months, muting calls for an interest rate hike in coming months.
The consumer price index rose 1.8 percent in October from a year ago, below the 1.9 percent projected in a Reuters survey, and falling short of the Bank of Korea's (BOK) 2 percent target.
Such subdued inflation may raise new doubts about the central bank's next steps given that market participants have been expecting the bank to raise interest rates for the first time in over six years at its Nov. 30 meeting.
""Inflationary pressure is not strong, and it now seems there is no urgent need for a rate increase,"" said Lee Sang-jae, an economist at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Lee said he still sees a hike at the bank's November meeting, but acknowledged the BOK could act later than expected as slower inflation triggered new doubts about growth momentum in the economy. 
In a Reuters poll conducted on Oct 27, 11 of 13 economists said they saw the BOK raising its policy rate by 25 basis points from a record low of 1.25 percent at the end-November meeting. All those who forecast a hike in November cited much stronger-than-expected third-quarter growth readings posted on Oct. 26. 
Wednesday's data showed prices were down 0.2 percent on a monthly basis versus the survey's expected 0.1 percent decline.
October's core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, was an annual 1.3 percent, down from September's annual 1.6 percent. 
Fresh food costs moderated after surging through the summer, increasing 1.8 percent on-year following a 6 percent jump in September. Prices of electricity, gas and water decreased 1.6 percent following an 8 percent increase in September.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 10:20PM ET</span>",China October factory output rises at weakest pace in four months: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing output rose at the weakest pace in fourth months in October and companies continued to shed staff despite a slight pick-up in domestic and export orders, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
Stringent winter air pollution curbs could add to business costs and force companies to throttle back production further in coming months, one analyst said.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) was 51.0 in October, unchanged from September’s reading and in line with economists' expectations for a further modest improvement in operating conditions.
But the production sub-index fell to 50.8 from 52.1, nearing the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, while confidence in the outlook over the next year moderated to the second-lowest since August 2016.
The Caixin report followed a similar official survey on Tuesday which pointed to an unexpected cooldown in China's manufacturing sector in the face of a weakening property market and a crackdown on smog, which is forcing some steel mills and factories in the northeast to curtail or halt production.
The Caixin version, which tends to focus more on small and mid-sized companies, did show a modest expansion in domestic and export demand, however, while the official readings showed a marked softening in new business.
The private survey also suggested further pressure on profit margins for smaller companies, which have not benefited as much from a year-long construction boom as their larger, state-owned peers.
Input prices continued to rise at a sharp clip due to higher raw material costs and tougher environmental policies, but stiff competition limited firms' ability to fully pass on the cost increases to their customers.
The rate of input price inflation was among the highest since early 2011, though it did ease slightly from September.
""The stringent production curbs imposed by the government to reduce pollution and relatively low inventory levels have added to cost pressures on companies in midstream and downstream industries, which could have a negative impact on production in the coming months,” Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.
Small- and medium-sized manufacturers in China's industrial heartland are struggling with soaring costs or facing closure as
as a mandated switch from coal to cleaner-burning fuel pushes natural gas prices higher, according to a Reuters report citing industry executives.
China's economy has surprised global financial markets and investors with robust growth of nearly 6.9 percent so far this year, driven by a renaissance in long-ailing ""smokestack"" industries such as steel.
But property and construction activity, two of the economy's main growth drivers, are starting to cool under the weight of government measures to cool heated housing prices and higher borrowing costs.

The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 52.8, above the preliminary reading of 52.5 and just below September's final reading of 52.9.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 14th consecutive month.
""The headline PMI for October indicated slightly softer growth, however the underlying data remains fairly solid,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Output picked up, growing at the quickest pace since May, while export orders from other Asian countries underpinned a firm rise in new business inflows.""
The output component of the PMI index was a final 53.3, above a preliminary a 52.6 and above a final 53.2 in September.
The final index measuring companies' expectations for future output was higher than the preliminary reading and remained firmly positive, but was at an 11-month low.
The PMI survey comes one day after government data showed manufacturers expect output to rise in October and then fall in November as they adjust production in electronics parts in response to shifting demand from China.
Recent data has shown a slight slowdown in exports and industrial output, but economists remain optimistic that a tight labor market and rising business investment will keep growth on track.

Foreign nationals were behind 5 percent of home purchases in Metro Vancouver in September, up from about 0.9 percent in August 2016, the month the 15 percent levy was enacted in response to offshore money flowing into the west coast city's overheated housing market.
In the suburb of Richmond, home to Canada's largest immigrant population, foreign buyers accounted for 10.8 percent of purchases in September, while in nearby Burnaby, foreign buyers were behind 9.6 percent of deals.
The numbers were still below those of July 2016, when more than 24 percent of home sales in both Burnaby and Richmond involved foreign nationals, as buyers scrambled to close to deals before the tax took effect.
British Columbia's New Democratic government inherited the foreign buyer tax from the previous Liberal government, and Finance Minister Carole James has been reviewing the levy as part of a new strategy on housing affordability.
""I'm concerned about the role of foreign speculation in B.C.'s housing market. ... All options are on the table as we look at the impact the tax has had on the housing market,"" she said in a statement.
Sales of detached homes in the Vancouver area plunged sharply in the months after the foreign buyer tax was announced, with the market remaining tepid over the past year. 
Condo sales, which are at a much lower price point than detached homes, rebounded more quickly and prices have jumped 21.7 percent in the past year.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Mexico economy likely shrank for first time in four years after quakes,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy likely shrank for the first time in more than four years during the third quarter, a preliminary official estimate showed on Tuesday, after the country was battered by earthquakes and hurricanes in September.
Gross domestic product in Latin America's second-biggest economy contracted around 0.2 percent in seasonally adjusted terms during the July-September period compared with the previous quarter, the national statistics agency said.
That follows expansion of 0.6 percent in the second quarter. If confirmed, it would be the first quarterly contraction since the second quarter of 2013. Official third-quarter data will be released on Nov. 24.
Mexico was struck by two devastating earthquakes in September and was also hit by hurricanes. The head of the statistics agency, Julio Santaella, said on Twitter that economic activity had been affected by the quakes.
The government says the cost of rebuilding tens of thousands of homes and buildings damaged by the quakes, which killed at least 471 people, will approach 48 billion pesos ($2.5 billion).
Central bank officials have said that after a dip in output, the economy should bounce back as reconstruction efforts gather pace.
The preliminary data showed the industrial sector likely shrank by 0.5 percent in the July-September period versus the second quarter, while services slipped 0.1 percent. Agriculture expanded 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter.
Economists noted that the drop in services, a main engine of growth in recent years, might not be due to the quake.
""Activity was significantly more resilient than expected during the first half of 2017, but there are now growing and clear signs that the forward momentum is softening,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a report.
The national statistics institute also introduced a new base year of 2013 for GDP data, replacing data based on 2008.
The revisions led to higher growth during previous quarters as mining now has a lower weight than services, economists at Banorte said.
Given those higher growth rates in the first two quarters, Banorte raised its outlook for economic expansion this year from 1.9 percent to 2.1 percent.
Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, the economy grew by about 1.6 percent in unadjusted terms, the statistics agency said.
Before the string of natural disasters, Mexico's economy had been more resilient than expected this year after U.S. President Donald Trump held off on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made exports.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 12:48PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence near 17-year high; wages rising,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a near 17-year high in October, with households upbeat about the labor market and business conditions, which could underpin consumer spending and boost the economy in the final three months of the year.
The economy's prospects were further bolstered by other reports on Tuesday showing an acceleration in wage growth in the third quarter and sustained increases in house prices in August. The strong domestic fundamentals likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.
""An optimistic consumer emboldened by a solid economy and an increasingly competitive labor market is likely to continue to spend, reinforcing a virtuous cycle that should be supportive of further growth,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 5.3 points to 125.9 this month, the highest reading since December 2000.
The surge in confidence was probably driven by expectations of big tax cuts after President Donald Trump and Republicans in the U.S. Congress vowed to enact tax reform this year. The proposed plan unveiled in late September promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals.
Record high share prices also likely contributed to the rise in consumer confidence this month. Confidence among households in the $125,000 and over income group increased sharply, but optimism among low-income consumers was mostly lower.
""The rich only get richer in this economy where the advancing tide is not lifting all the boats,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, was the most favorable since July 2001.
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, is pointing to further declines in the jobless rate and labor market slack. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.
Tightening labor market conditions are gradually generating a faster pace of wage growth. A separate report from the Labor Department showed the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.7 percent in the third quarter after rising 0.5 percent rise in the second quarter.
That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.5 percent, the largest gain since the first quarter of 2015.
WELCOME SIGN
Signs of a pickup in wage growth, which has lagged the eight-year economic recovery, are likely to be welcomed by Fed officials, who are scheduled to begin a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates this week, but is expected to increase borrowing costs in December for a third time this year.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, also lifted by upbeat earnings from consumer companies Mondelez (O:MDLZ) and Kellogg (N:K). The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries slipped.
Steadily increasing wages offer hope that inflation could soon trend higher. Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target. Labor costs increased 2.4 percent in the year to June.
A government report on Monday showed the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increasing 1.3 percent in the 12 months through September. The core PCE has undershot the Fed's 2 percent target for nearly 5-1/2 years.
""As long as the labor market remains tight and wages are firming, Fed officials will continue to expect inflation to move higher next year and thus will be inclined to stay on the gradual normalization path, even in the face of current low inflation prints,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.7 percent in the third quarter. They increased 0.5 percent in the second quarter. Wages and salaries were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months through September after gaining 2.3 percent in the year to June.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 5.9 percent in August from a year ago after increasing 5.8 percent in July.
House prices are being driven by an acute shortage of properties available for sale. Robust consumer confidence, rising wages and strong house prices should keep consumer spending supported for the rest of the year.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. Households, however, relied heavily on savings to fund purchases, leading to concerns that consumer spending could slow down in the months ahead.

Savings dropped in September to their lowest level since August 2008. A fourth report showed factory activity in the Midwest vaulted to a 6-1/2-year high in October.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew faster than expected last quarter and unemployment fell to its lowest in almost nine years, backing up the European Central Bank's move to begin reducing its bond buying despite slightly soft inflation this month.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that the gross domestic product of the 19 countries that use the euro grew 0.6 percent in July-September from the previous three months and was 2.5 percent higher than in the same period of 2016. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent quarterly rise and a 2.4 percent year-on-year gain.
""The better-than-expected GDP print – along with our leading indicators – suggests that growth remains robust, thus supporting the recent ECB QE recalibration,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists Daniele Antonucci and Joao Almeida wrote in a note.
Last week the ECB took its first step towards weaning the euro zone off ultra-loose money by saying that from January it will halve the amount of bonds it buys every month to 30 billion euros. It nevertheless promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking.
The economic growth helped bring down euro zone unemployment to the lowest level since January 2009, beating market expectations.
The unemployment rate fell to 8.9 percent of the workforce or 14.513 million people in September from a downwardly revised 9.0 percent, or 14.609 million, in August. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an unemployment rate of 9.0 percent.
But consumer price growth in October eased to 1.4 percent year-on-year, a Eurostat estimate showed, from 1.5 percent in the previous two months. The ECB wants to see headline inflation below but close to 2 percent over a two-year horizon.
The slower inflation was mainly because of slower growth of energy prices, which rose 3.0 percent year-on-year in October, slowing from 3.9 percent in September, offsetting equally volatile unprocessed food prices which rose 2.8 percent after 1.5 percent in September.
Measured without these two most volatile components, inflation slowed to 1.1 percent in October from 1.3 percent in September.
""Strong growth supports the notion that core inflation should eventually normalize further, while headline inflation is likely to print lower for some time and follow a V-shaped trajectory, to come closer to the ECB target from late 2018,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

""Despite today's downside surprise, core HICP has inflected higher since the 'local' low of 0.7 percent in March, albeit gradually and from a low level. It should get back to its long-term average of 1.5 percent in the second half of 2018,"" it said.

With inflation still distant from his 2 percent target, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stressed that he saw no immediate need to exit its ultra-easy policy even as other major central banks have started to unwind their crisis-era monetary programs.
Acknowledging the rising costs and diminishing returns of his stimulus program, however, Kuroda signaled the chance of slowing the BOJ's exchange-traded fund (ETF) buying before embarking on a full-fledged withdrawal of stimulus.
""When adjustments to our framework become necessary, they don't need to involve everything in the BOJ's framework. Our (ETF) purchases focus on affecting risk premium, so we will take that into account in making a decision,"" Kuroda told a briefing.
The remarks came after the BOJ's widely expected decision to maintain a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields around zero percent.
Newcomer Goushi Kataoka voted against keeping policy steady for the second straight meeting, arguing that the BOJ should make clear its readiness to expand stimulus again if domestic factors delay achievement of its price target.
While not an official proposal for easing, the former private economist also said the BOJ should buy government bonds so 15-year yields ""remain at less than 0.2 percent"". The 15-year government bond yield stood around 0.307 percent on Tuesday.
The dissent by Kataoka could complicate the BOJ's efforts to follow in the footsteps of its U.S. and European counterparts in withdrawing stimulus, analysts say.
""Other central banks are unwinding easy policy, so distortions will emerge if the BOJ continues with its current framework,"" said Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""If Kataoka proposes more easing, it just complicates things further. There are no hawks on the board, so the BOJ could lose its chance to normalize policy.""
BOJ TRIMS INFLATION OUTLOOK, MAINTAINS TIMEFRAME
In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ slightly cut its inflation forecasts for the current fiscal year ending in March 2018 but roughly maintained its optimistic projections for the following years.
It also maintained its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020.
After three years of heavy asset purchases failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ last year revamped its policy framework to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing.
Aside from its bond purchases, the BOJ keeps buying ETFs at an annual pace of 6 trillion yen ($53 billion). The move has drawn criticism from some analysts who say it distorts markets and is unnecessary with Tokyo stock prices scaling multi-year highs.
Kuroda said that while the recovery was gaining momentum, he saw no immediate need to raise the BOJ's yield targets, slow risky asset purchases or debate a strategy for withdrawing stimulus.
""The economy is sustaining its momentum to achieve 2 percent inflation, but the momentum remains weak,"" he said.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.
But core consumer prices rose just 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target, keeping the bank under pressure to maintain its ultra-easy policy.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 11:55PM ET</span>","China October factory growth slows more than expected on smog war, softer export orders","By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector cooled more than expected in October in the face of tighter pollution rules that are forcing many steel mills, smelters and factories to curtail production over the winter.
While still easily in expansionary territory, China's monthly official factory survey also showed unexpected weakness in new export orders, which had been expected to pick up heading into the peak year-end shopping season.
The data gives global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of the fourth quarter, with the government's punishing war on smog adding to uncertainty amid early signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
""Some regions stepped up pollution controls this month, with firms adjusting, halting or staggering production,"" National Statistics Bureau official Zhao Qinghe said in comments published with the data.
Zhao said that activity in energy-intensive and polluting industries slowed in October, while high-end manufacturing and consumption-related manufacturing continued to grow.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Tuesday fell to 51.6 in October, from 52.4 in September, which was the strongest in over five years.
It was the weakest reading in three months, but remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the PMI would fall slightly to 52.0, but still point to the 15th straight month of expansion.
China's economy has recorded better-than-expected growth of nearly 6.9 percent through the first nine months of this year, buoyed largely by a recovery in its manufacturing and industrial sectors thanks to strong government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports.
Profits for the country's industrial powerhouses surged 27.7 percent in September, the most in nearly six years, as environmental inspections and the start of plant closures in smog-blighted northern provinces sparked fears of supply shortages and sent prices of finished goods like steel and copper sharply higher.
However, the latest survey showed input price gains slowed considerably in October, with the reading at 63.4 compared to 68.4 in September and the weakest since July.
A separate PMI for the steel industry showed raw material purchase prices fell sharply in October after strong gains in recent months.
Output price gains also slowed, reflecting concerns that higher commodity prices have not trickled down to higher prices and profit margins for downstream industries.
Prices of steelmaking raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal have started to dive on fears that winter output curbs will lead to a supply glut, weighing on mining companies and global commodity prices. [IRONORE/]
More rigorous restrictions on steel output are expected in November as manufacturers in 28 cities in northern China have been asked to stagger production to reduce emissions.
THE COST OF BLUE SKIES
The latest pollution closures come on top of ongoing government efforts to trim down and upgrade China's bloated industrial sector by shutting down outdated capacity, which has also helped support producer prices.
The PMI decline was ""likely due to disruptions to industrial activity in north-eastern China as a result of the ongoing environmental crackdown, as well as softer investment spending in response to slower credit growth and the unwinding of pre-Party Congress fiscal support,"" said Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard.
""We anticipate further weakness in the months ahead.""
A sub-reading for output fell to 53.4 in October from 54.7 the previous month, still solid but matching the slowest growth over the last seven months.
At China's recently-concluded Communist Party Congress, President Xi Jinping said the country would pursue high-quality growth over high-speed growth while reinforcing a pledge to win the war on pollution and clamp down on riskier types of lending.
But analysts are unsure if the government would stomach the risk of markedly slower economic growth rates without resorting to fresh stimulus measures, as authorities have done in the past.
COOLING DEMAND
The official survey pointed to cooling demand at home and abroad. Export order growth nearly stalled, and was the weakest since December, while imports also slowed, though they remained in expansionary territory.
Large firms, many state-owned, continued to outperform at the expense of small and mid-sized firms, with medium-sized companies backsliding the most in October.
""The lower PMI implies some weakening in (economic) growth momentum in October after a strong September,"" economists at Nomura said in a note. ""We maintain our forecast of real GDP growth slowing further to 6.6 percent year-on-year in Q4 from 6.8 percent in Q3.""
Growth in China's services sector also eased in October, but continued to show solid expansion, a sister survey showed, suggesting it may offset much of the downdraft from the loss of steam in manufacturing.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.3 from 55.4 in September, which was the strongest reading since May 2014.
A sub-reading for the construction sector fell to 58.5 from 61.1 in September.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.
The employment situation in both the manufacturing and services industries worsened in October, with firms across the economy shedding staff at a faster rate, the data showed.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 11:19PM ET</span>",South Korea factory output grows at fastest annual rate in four years,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's September factory output barely grew from a month earlier but nonetheless notched the fastest annual jump in more than four years, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday. 
Factory output blew past a 4.7 percent forecast and soared 8.4 percent from a year earlier on what a Statistics Korea official said was a base-year effect.
Output only rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent from August, far below the 2.4 percent seen in a Reuters poll.
""September being a holiday-shortened month in 2016 is the main reason for the surge in on-year terms,"" the Statistics Korea official said. ""While output barely grew from August, the production base is much higher now compared to the same time last year. Output has been gradually expanding as manufacturing of semi-conductor chips is in a super-cycle.""
A so-called global ""super-cycle"" in memory chips has been a particular boon for the South Korean economy which is geared toward hi-tech exports, with gross domestic product rising over the July-September period at its fastest rate in seven years.
The chip boom helped Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) to book a record operating profit in the third quarter as tight supply and strong demand for semi-conductors drove up revenue.
Tuesday's report showed output of semi-conductors jumped 13.4 percent in September from a year earlier after rising for most of this year, boosting output figures especially in on-year terms.
Production of cars soared 27.1 percent from a year earlier on base-year effects.
In September 2016 factory output fell 2 percent from a year earlier on a fewer working days because of the Chuseok holiday and as  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) experienced its first full strike in 12 years, disrupting production.
This year, South Korea celebrated the annual Chuseok holiday from Oct 2 through Oct 9.
In an encouraging sign that the recovery is becoming more balanced and broad-based, services output grew 1.3 percent in September and marked the fastest growth since July 2015 thanks to a brisk retail sector. 
Service sector data suggested private consumption picked up in September, supporting the stellar third-quarter growth reading published last week.
""Service sector output saw a big jump, so it could see some adjustments in the coming months, but it will continue to expand on improving domestic demand,"" the Statistics Korea official said.
A separate report from the Bank of Korea on Tuesday showed business sentiment for November jumped to a near six-year high as an improved economic outlook and strong exports boosted overall confidence.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 09:01PM ET</span>",BOJ set to hold fire; focus on dissenter's stimulus preference,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is set to keep monetary policy steady and roughly maintain its ambitious price forecasts on Tuesday, pointing to signs of growing strength in the economy that policymakers hope will accelerate inflation towards its elusive 2 percent target.
But Goushi Kataoka, a newcomer to the board, may propose ramping up stimulus after dissenting last month to a decision to stand pat on policy, setting back the BOJ's quest to dial back its massive monetary support, analysts say.
At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.
The market's focus would be on whether Kataoka will propose expanding stimulus. While any such proposal is likely to be voted down, it may expose a rift in the nine-member board on the future direction of monetary policy.
""If Kataoka proposes additional easing, that would be an important turning point for future debate on monetary policy,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The proposal could mark a starting point for shifting the debate within and outside the BOJ, from seeking an exit from easy policy to strengthening stimulus,"" he said.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely hold a briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.
In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is seen trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from the 1.1 percent it estimated made in July, sources say.
The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020, they said.
The BOJ currently projects inflation will hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

But core consumer prices rose just 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target, keeping the bank under pressure to maintain ultra-easy policy even as its U.S. and European peers begin to scale back their stimulus.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>","Japan industrial output falls less than expected, spending disappoints","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output fell less than expected in September and companies expect output to rise in October - keeping the economy on an expansion path. 
Labor demand remained at the strongest level in 43 years, but household spending unexpectedly fell in September, raising some concern about the lack of impact a tight jobs market had on consumer spending.
The Bank of Japan is expected to signal at a policy meeting ending on Tuesday that it will hold off on expanding stimulus for the time being, but it may still struggle to explain why economic growth is not pushing up consumer prices.
""Industrial output fell due to temporary weakness in China's economy, but global demand remains solid, so output will rise in the future,"" said Daiju Aoki, regional chief investment officer for Japan at UBS Securities.
""Consumer spending looks a little weak. It's important for the BOJ to see a recovery in consumption. Unless this happens, the BOJ could lower its growth forecasts in the future.""
Industrial output fell 1.1 percent in September because of a fall in output of memory chips, equipment to make flat panel displays, and heavy machinery used in construction, trade ministry data showed on Tuesday.
The fall was the largest in four months but still less than the median estimate for a 1.5 percent decline. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 4.7 percent in October and fall 0.9 percent in November.
Japan's jobless rate held steady at 2.8 percent in September, data from the Internal Affairs Ministry showed, matching the median estimate.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio also held steady at 1.52 in September from the previous month, showing labor demand remains at the strongest in 43 years. The median estimate was for 1.53.
Household spending fell 0.3 percent in September from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms, compared with economists' median estimate of a 0.7 percent annual increase.
The decline was due to lower spending on golf, travel, air conditioners and refrigerators, the data showed.
Domestic demand was brisk in the first half of the year, but the weaker-than-expected household spending data suggests it is now losing some momentum. 
Economic growth has been slow to translate into higher consumer prices, which is frustrating the BOJ's efforts to reflate the economy.

Core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September from a year ago, well away from the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 11:40AM ET</span>",Bank of England set for step into unknown with first rate hike since 2007,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to step into the unknown on Thursday, when it is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2007 at a time when growth appears weaker than before any other rate rise of the past 20 years.
Having cut rates to a record low 0.25 percent in August 2016 after Britons voted to leave the European Union, the BoE is now correcting course and falling in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are either raising rates or scaling back stimulus.
Whereas the United States and the euro zone are enjoying robust growth, however, Britain's economy has grown at its slowest pace in more than four years over the past 12 months.
Quarterly growth of 0.4 percent offers the weakest backdrop to any rate rise since the BoE became independent in 1997.
True, inflation is at a five-year high of 3.0 percent, a full percentage point above the BoE's target, but that is mainly because the pound is an average 11 percent weaker against the currencies of Britain's main trading partners since the Brexit vote. 
The BoE has often overlooked past spikes in inflation if they were caused by currency fluctuations that were deemed to be temporary.
Inflation is set to fall this time too, but only slowly, as the BoE judges domestic inflation pressures are pending.
Partly due to stagnant productivity since the 2008 financial crisis - and partly due to concerns about the effect of Brexit on immigration, trade and investment - BoE Governor Mark Carney thinks the economy cannot grow as fast as it has in the past without generating excess inflation.
""We're in a new paradigm,"" says George Buckley, an economist at Nomura who was one of the first to sense a change at the central bank earlier this year, when most economists were saying they did not expect rates to rise until 2019.
Raising rates now would be the biggest call on monetary policy Carney has made as governor, and may shape his legacy.
Carney has faced criticism from economists who say his past guidance on monetary policy has been unhelpful, and from Brexit supporters who say he is too focused on the risks of leaving the EU. But until recently his broad approach to interest rates has been fairly uncontroversial.
For most BoE watchers, the likelihood of a rate rise only became clear in September, when minutes of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee's meeting that month showed underlying price pressures were no longer a minority concern.
Two policymakers voted for a rate rise, and a majority of the others said they expected to do so ""over the coming months"".
RAISING RATES ""MAD""
Almost all economists polled by Reuters last week expect the BoE to raise interest rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent on Thursday. Most do not expect another one next year and 70 percent said even one rate rise would be a mistake. The latter view is common in markets, too.
""Personally, I think it would be mad,"" Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investors, which manages $430 billion of assets, told Reuters earlier this month.
""You'd be tightening at a time of economic softness to defend against a weakness in sterling that you need (to boost exports).""
The BoE says its policy decisions are not driven by exchange rates. When Carney gives his news conference at 1230 GMT on Thursday, he is likely to focus on a 42-year low in unemployment and how it heralds more upward pressure on wages and inflation.
The BoE has been here before, however. Unemployment has repeatedly fallen further than the BoE forecast in recent years, while wage growth has remained stubbornly around 2 percent, half the 4 percent rate associated with pre-crisis rate rises. 
Investors will be keen to glean what is meant in practice by the BoE's long-standing stated expectation that it will only raise rates ""at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"".
Markets have priced in an almost 90 percent chance of a rate rise on Thursday, but then expect the BoE to wait until late 2018 before raising again, Nomura's Buckley said.
He said that was probably too long for the BoE's tastes. On the other hand, however, Carney will not want to box himself in or lead the wider public to believe he plans to return rates to their pre-crisis level of around 5 percent.
Economists do not expect one or two rate rises will hurt growth much unless businesses or the public think many more will come and curb spending as a result. 
BoE forecasts showing inflation is still expected to exceed its target even after three years might be the clearest sign that the BoE thinks faster rate rises are needed, Buckley said.
Either way, the stakes are high both for the BoE and its governor, who has said he will step down at the end of June 2019.

""If he presides over a tightening of monetary policy and it slows down the economy, that's what he will be remembered for,"" McCaughan said.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 11:15AM ET</span>","Euro zone sentiment keeps surging, unaffected by Catalan crisis","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment rose in October for the fifth consecutive month to reach its highest level since the start of 2001, showing almost no impact from the Catalan crisis, European Commission data showed on Monday.
The near 17-year high, the highest reading since January 2001 when the bursting of the dot-com bubble had begun to hit confidence in the euro zone, confirmed the economic recovery of the 19-country currency bloc after a decade-long economic and financial crunch.
The monthly survey showed that sentiment in the euro zone rose more than the average forecast of economists polled by Reuters to 114.0 points in October from a 113.1 the previous month.
Confidence grew markedly in Germany, the bloc's largest economy, and in Italy. It declined in France.
Sentiment also improved in Spain, despite the Catalan crisis, with marked rises in the industry and services sectors. But confidence dropped in the country's retail sector and among consumers.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy assumed direct control of Catalonia on Friday, hours after the region declared independence following a referendum on Oct. 1.
Data show that ""political tensions continue to have little effect on economic sentiment this year"", Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING said.
The figures confirm sound economic growth in the euro zone, which is expected to expand 0.5 percent in the third quarter from the second, forecasts by economists polled by Reuters show.
The European Union statistics office Eurostat will release preliminary estimates on Tuesday on the bloc's gross domestic product in the third quarter. If the data confirm the 0.5 percent forecast, growth will have slowed from the second quarter's 0.6 percent.
But economists remain confident growth will accelerate again in the last three months of the year. 
""While the available hard data imply that euro-zone GDP growth slowed a little in Q3, we think that it will pick up again in Q4,"" economic research firm Capital Economics said in a note.
In October, optimism in the euro zone grew in all surveyed economic sectors, jumping to 16.2 points from 15.4 in September in services, the largest sector in the euro zone.
Industry's confidence grew to 7.9 from 6.7 and retailerssaw a rise to 5.5 from 3.0.
Consumers shared the positive mood, with optimism rising to -1.0 from -1.2 in September, reaching the highest level in 16 years, data released on Monday showed, confirming a preliminary estimate published last week. 
The euro zone's improving sentiment did not extend to Britain, where confidence among consumers dropped to -5.5 from -5.2 in September.
The positive reading for the 19-country euro zone was only partly clouded by a drop in inflation expectations among manufacturers to 8.6 from 10.5 in September. 
That could curb output in coming months. Manufacturing production expectations dipped slightly, while export orders rose only marginally.

Inflation expectations among consumers continued to increase, to 14.7 from 14.2 in September.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 11:04AM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending grows at fastest pace since 2009, savings drop","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in more than eight years in September, likely as households in Texas and Florida replaced flood-damaged motor vehicles, but underlying inflation remained muted.
Households, however, dipped into their savings to fund purchases last month, pushing savings to their lowest level since 2008. Against the backdrop of lackluster wage growth, the drop in savings suggests that September's robust pace of consumer spending is probably unsustainable.
""Relying on consumer savings to move the economy forward is not going to last for long,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.0 percent last month after an unrevised 0.1 percent gain in August. The increase, which also included a boost from higher household spending on utilities, was the largest since August 2009.
Economists had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.8 percent in September. The data was included in last Friday's third-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending growth slowing to a 2.4 percent annualized rate after a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter. 
The moderation in consumption was offset by a rise in inventory investment, business spending on equipment and a drop in imports, which left the economy growing at a 3.0 percent rate in the third quarter after the April-June period's brisk 3.1 percent pace. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which starts on Tuesday. Investors were also awaiting the announcement of a new Fed chief, which is expected this week. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were largely flat.
The Commerce Department said the September data reflected the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but said it could not quantify the total impact of the storms on consumer spending and personal income. 
Consumer spending in September was buoyed by purchases of motor vehicles, probably as drivers in Texas and Florida replaced automobiles that were destroyed when Harvey and Irma slammed the states in late August and early September. 
Spending on long-lasting goods like autos surged 3.2 percent last month. Outlays on services rose 0.5 percent. 
CORE INFLATION BENIGN
Though disruptions to the supply chain as a result of the hurricanes also likely contributed to an uptick in inflation last month, underlying price pressures remained benign. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, edged up 0.1 percent in September. The so-called core PCE has now increased by 0.1 percent for five straight months.
The core PCE increased 1.3 percent in the 12 months through September after a similar gain in August. The core PCE has undershot the Fed's 2 percent target for nearly 5-1/2 years.
The soft core PCE readings are likely to intensify the inflation debate among Fed officials. 
Some policymakers believe the low inflation readings are the result of transitory factors like one-off reductions in the costs of mobile phone services, and expect price pressure to rise as the labor market tightens. Others, however, worry that the factors behind tame inflation could prove more persistent.
The U.S. central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates this week, but is expected to do so in December. It has raised rates twice this year.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.6 percent in September after slipping 0.1 percent in August. While that put consumer spending on a higher growth trajectory heading into the fourth quarter, the pace is unlikely to be maintained.
Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in August. Income at the disposal of households after inflation was flat after slipping 0.1 percent in August.
With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $441.9 billion in September, the lowest level since August 2008, from $521.4 billion in the prior month. The saving rate dropped five-tenths of a percentage point to 3.1 percent, the lowest level since December 2007.

""The low savings rate is expected to be a larger constraint on consumer spending in the months ahead and could lead to higher delinquency rates for some categories of consumer credit if real income growth continues to lag,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German annual inflation slowed in October and remained below the European Central Bank's target, data showed on Monday, lending support to the bank's decision to withdraw monetary stimulus only slowly.
Consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), increased by 1.5 percent on the year after a rise of 1.8 percent in September, the Federal Statistics Office said. On the month, prices fell by 0.1 percent.
Both figures undershot expectations. A Reuters poll had pointed to an increase of 1.7 percent on the year and a rise of 0.1 percent on the month.
The ECB last week said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January, but extended the program until the end of September, promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking, citing muted price pressures.
""Considering the strong expansion (in the euro zone) an ultra-expansive monetary policy is no longer justifiable,"" VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel wrote in a note.
""But looking at the inflation rate on the other hand, a significantly tighter monetary policy cannot be considered.""
A breakdown of non-harmonized German data showed that only food inflation had picked up from September. The prices of energy, services and rents grew by less in October than in the previous month.
Spanish inflation data, also published on Monday, showed that annual consumer price inflation inched down to 1.7 percent on the year in October, below September's reading of 1.8 percent
'ECB COMFORTABLE'
The ECB's careful approach is opposed by Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann who before the ECB policy meeting last week demanded a quick and consistent withdrawal of monetary support.
ECB chief Mario Draghi said on Thursday the central bank's decisions were not unanimous and that there was a large majority on some but not all policy measures approved by the ECB governing council, of which Weidmann is a member.
Economists said that inflationary pressures in Europe's largest economy should continue to be subdued, partly because the stronger euro translates into little upward pressure on wages.
The German economy grew by 0.7 percent on the quarter between January and March and by 0.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by household and state spending as consumers and authorities reap the benefits of record-low borrowing costs and a low unemployment rate.

""As long as the showcase model of the euro zone economy – the German economy – which is also the most advanced in the current cycle, doesn't show any signs of accelerating inflationary pressure, the ECB will feel extremely comfortable with its dovish tapering,"" said Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that personal spending increased 1.0% in September from the prior month, compared to expectations for a rise of 0.8% and the prior month’s 0.1% gain.
Consumer spending is the single biggest source of U.S. economic growth, accounting for as much as two-thirds of economic activity.
Personal income, meanwhile, registered an increase of 0.4% in September, in line with forecasts and compared to the prior rise of 0.2%.
Meanwhile, the core PCE price index rose 0.1% in September from a month earlier, in line with expectations for it to match the previous month’s advance.
The core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1.3% in September, also matching consensus for a repeat of the prior month’s increase.
The Federal Reserve uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.
The report also showed that real personal consumption gained 0.6% last month, beating expectations for a 0.5% increase and following a drop of 0.1% in August.

National Bureau of Statistics Deputy Head Li Xiaochao said on Monday there had been significant improvement in the long-standing discrepancy between national and regional GDP data.
The government had stepped up inspections of potentially fraudulent data and was working towards unifying the accounting systems used by national and local authorities.
""The problem of discrepancy between regional and national GDP data has significantly improved, but (the gap) is still large,"" Li said in an interview with China Information News that was published on the statistics bureau's website on Monday.
""This situation is not conducive to accurately understanding regional economic trends, scientifically implementing macroeconomic controls, and impacts the credibility of government statistics,"" Li said.
The gap has been narrowing, but the discrepancy between provincial GDP and the national figure was still 2.76 trillion yuan ($401 billion) last year, roughly equal to the GDP of Thailand, according to Reuters calculations.Several cases of falsified government data have been publicized over the last year, with high-level officials pledging harsh penalties for making fraudulent submissions.
Li said the NBS will work with regional statistics agencies to compile regional data, with national and regional data to be released together once the new system is in place.
The statistics office said it would push forward inclusion of research and development spending into regional GDP data, and would research methods for calculating service output from owner-occupied housing as part of improving its statistical methods.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2017 11:00PM ET</span>",China October factory growth seen easing slightly as smog war begins,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector likely grew at a slightly slower pace in October as the government began a major crackdown on air pollution, ordering many steel mills, smelters and factories to curtail or halt production over the winter, a Reuters poll showed. 
But official readings are still expected to show a healthy rate of expansion for manufacturing overall, buoyed by a continuing government infrastructure spree and strong global demand for China's exports heading into the peak year-end shopping season.
The data will give global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of the fourth quarter, with the war on smog adding to uncertainty and coinciding with early signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on Tuesday is expected to come in at 52.0 for October, down from 52.4 in September, which was the highest in over 5 years, according to a median forecast of 36 economists polled by Reuters.
That would be the 15th month in a row that the reading remained above the 50-mark that divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, and would still be the second-highest in the last five years. 
A recovery for China's manufacturing and industrial firms -- boosted by government spending, a resilient property market and 
unexpected strength in exports -- has helped the economy post better-than-expected growth of nearly 6.9 percent through the first nine months of this year.
Profits for China's industrial powerhouses surged 27.7 percent in September, the most in nearly six years, as environmental inspections and the start of plant closures in northern provinces sparked fears of supply shortages and sent prices of finished goods like steel and copper sharply higher.
Prices of steelmaking raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal, however, have started to dive on fears of excess supply, which should start to weigh on mining companies.[IRONORE/]
The pollution closures come on top of ongoing government efforts to trim down and upgrade the country's bloated industrial sector by shutting down outdated capacity, which has also helped support producer prices.
SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES
While third-quarter GDP growth data released earlier this month hardly skipped a beat after a strong first half, the economy is starting to show some signs of fatigue in two of its main drivers - property and construction.
Still, senior officials said recently that China is still well on track to meet its official 2017 growth target of around 6.5 percent, despite the punishing war on pollution.
Economists expect the findings of a private survey on China's factory activity on Wednesday will show activity in October expanded a similar rate to the previous month.
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will be unchanged at 51.0 in October versus the previous month.
The private survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms, which have not benefited as much from the year-long state-led construction boom as large, government-owned ""smokestack"" industries.

The official PMI survey will be published on Oct. 31, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector. The Caixin PMI will be published on Nov. 1, with a Caixin services PMI to be released on Nov. 3.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose in September at the fastest pace in three months as shoppers spent more on clothes and daily goods in a sign that consumer spending remains strong due to a tight labor market.
The 2.2 percent annual increase in retail sales in September was less than the median estimate for a 2.5 percent annual increase and follows a revised 1.8 percent annual increase in August.
Strong consumer spending makes it more likely that consumer prices will accelerate in the future, which supports the Bank of Japan's argument that it can afford to keep its monetary easing unchanged as inflationary pressure gradually builds up.
""Consumption in July-September is likely to be a little bit weaker than the previous quarter, but the outlook remains healthy,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Consumer spending is still in moderate recovery. The labor market will support spending in the future.""
Spending on clothes rose 5.0 percent in September from a year ago, the fastest increase in three months, data from the trade ministry showed on Monday. Spending on daily goods like soap and shampoo rose an annual 1.2 percent, versus a 0.4 percent annual decline in the previous month.
The BOJ is expected to signal that it will hold off on expanding stimulus for the time being at a policy meeting ending on Tuesday.
The policy meeting comes after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's victory in a lower house election, which heightened expectations the BOJ's ultra-loose policy - a key pillar of his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies - will continue.

Core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September from a year ago, which is distant from the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target, although the central bank argues that consumer prices will eventually pick up because of the tight labor market and wage growth, albeit slow.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank cut its key rate to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent on Friday and said further cuts were likely in coming months.
Friday's cut was in line with market expectations. Sixteen of 20 analysts and economists polled by Reuters had predicted the central bank would lower its key rate by 25 basis points <RUCBIR=ECI>.
The central bank said it would consider cutting the key rate further as inflation has slipped below its 4 percent target to 2.7 percent in annual terms as of Oct. 23.
""The Bank of Russia Board of Directors leaves open the option of further rate reduction at its upcoming meetings,"" the central bank said in a statement.
Inflation has slowed faster than expected this year largely thanks to booming agriculture production and the central bank's tight monetary policy.
The slowdown in inflation was also driven by the stronger rouble, the central bank said.
""Moving forward, the Bank of Russia's key rate decisions will be based on its assessment on the balance of risks for inflation significantly and persistently deviating in either direction from the target, as well as consumer price movements and economic activity against the forecast,"" it said.
The central bank has previously said it aims to bring the key rate down to 6.5-7 percent in 2019 due to the sharp fall in inflation, which has tumbled from around 17 percent in early 2015.
The central bank said it had also confirmed its economic outlook. Last month, the central bank said it expected gross domestic product to grow by up to 2.2 percent in 2017.
The rouble briefly firmed to 58.00 versus the dollar compared with a level of 58.14 shortly before the rate decision.
The central bank's next rate meeting and a news conference with Governor Elvira Nabiullina is scheduled for Dec. 15.

Price growth is seen rising to 1.9 percent by 2022, in line with the ECB's target and above the 1.8 percent predicted three months ago, according to the survey of 58 forecasters, an important input in the ECB's policy deliberations.
The ECB decided on Thursday to halve asset buys from next year but extend them by 9 months, arguing that the improved outlook allows for reduced stimulus, even if lengthy central bank support is still needed.
Inflation projections for the coming years were left unchanged, though both 2018 and 2019 forecasts remained above projections by the ECB's staff, suggesting these may be revised up when they are updated in December.
Indeed, the euro is trading weaker than the ECB expected and oil prices are sharply higher, indicating that the September projections may be too pessimistic.
Economic growth is also likely to be faster than earlier expected, with forecasts raised for both 2018 and 2019.
The survey now sees growth at 1.9 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019, both 0.1 percentage point higher than three months ago. But longer term growth, defined as expansion in 2022, is still seen at 1.6 percent.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in over six years at its Nov. 30 meeting, months earlier than previously anticipated, after the economy grew at a robust pace in the third quarter, a Reuters poll showed.
A rate increase would mark the Bank of Korea's (BOK) first tightening since June 2011, and bring an end to a five-year easing cycle which began in July 2012.
Asia's fourth-largest economy has been riding an unexpectedly robust export cycle on strong global demand for memory chips, which has been cushioning some softness in private consumption. 
Eleven of 13 economists polled by Reuters said they now see the BOK raising its policy rate  by 25 basis points (bps) from a record-low of 1.25 percent when the bank next reviews policy at the end of November.
That was marked switch from an Oct. 17 poll, where economists were unanimous in expecting the bank to stay on hold for the rest of this year. Only a small minority had predicted a hike in the first half of 2018.
All of those who forecast a hike in November cited much stronger-than-expected third-quarter growth readings posted on Oct. 26. The data showed the economy clocked its fastest growth in seven years on soaring global demand for the country's electronics, particularly memory chips.
""It looks like a November hike is almost a done deal,"" said Stephen Lee, a fixed income analyst at Meritz Securities who changed his Nov. 30 view to a hike from a hold. 
""I sensed the BOK may be gearing up for a hike after the bank's October meeting but third-quarter growth nicely beat even the BOK's own forecast,"" Lee said, adding that conditions ""now look right"" for a tightening.
The BOK kept its policy rate unchanged on Oct. 19 but one dissenting policymaker called for a hike, prompting some speculation that a tightening could be on its way.
The BOK had cut rates eight times over the past five years to re-energize Asia's fourth-largest economy, even at the risk of aggravating high levels of household debt.
The move will be following the rate-hike path of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise rates for a third time this year in December and continue to whittle down its massive balance sheet.
But South Korea's domestic demand has remained sluggish, leaving growth still heavily reliant on exports.
Private consumption grew 0.7 percent in the third quarter from three months earlier, only at half the rate of overall GDP in the third quarter. Output from the construction sector expanded 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the slowest pace in nine quarters. 
Policymakers are also keeping a watchful eye on debt-laden domestic households struggling with limited income growth and the threat that poses to consumption.
Some analysts say domestic demand may not be strong enough to warrant a rate hike and that BOK should hold its fire this year.
""We really need to see how South Korea's economy goes in the fourth quarter. Pre-holiday effects might have made the (Q3) figures come out much bigger than they really are, which means it will be better for the BOK to wait a bit, further monitoring economic data,"" said Lee Jae-hyung, an economist at Yuanta Securities, who believes the BOK will hold fire until the end of this year.
Lee sees the BOK starting to raise rates in the first quarter of next year. 
South Korea celebrated the annual thanksgiving holiday from Oct 2. through Oct. 9. Businesses may have ""front loaded"" shipments into September, which could skew October readings.
October trade data, due on Nov. 1, is expected show another month of strong exports, after September marked a ninth consecutive month of double-digit expansion.
""There are fewer working days in October (then September) but exports will continue to show strong performance driven by sales of semiconductors,"" said Kathleen Oh, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank of Korea.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial production was expected to show a fall in September after solid gains the previous month, a Reuters poll found, although analysts say the trend remains upward thanks to expanding global demand. 
Industrial output was seen down 1.5 percent in September from the previous month after revised growth of 2.0 percent in August, the poll of 19 economists showed. 
Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said factory output had been up and down this year but would show a rising trend if the monthly data was averaged out. 
""Increasing demand, both in Japan and overseas, supported output growth but especially so for exports,"" he said.
""A pickup in the global economy and a softer yen boosted Japan's exports - they are a tailwind for manufacturers."" 
The trade ministry will announce the factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday Japan time (2350 GMT on Monday).
The poll also found the Bank of Japan was likely to maintain short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and keep the 10-year government bond yield target around zero percent next week. 
Separately, sources have told Reuters the BOJ is set to roughly maintain its price forecasts and blame stagnant inflation on factors like corporate efforts to boost productivity, signaling that it will hold off on expanding stimulus for the time being. [nL4N1MZ2E2]
The poll found retail sales were seen likely to grow 2.5 percent in September from a year ago, up for an 11th straight month, while household spending was seen rising an annual 0.7 percent for the month versus 0.6 percent in August.
""Consumer spending remains lackluster but sales in autumn and winter clothes performed well due to cool weather,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Japan's jobless rate was expected to be steady at 2.8 percent in September, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen at 1.53, matching a level last seen in February 1974. 
The trade ministry will issue the retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT on Sunday) while the internal affairs ministry will publish the labor market and household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday (2330 GMT on Monday).

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",U.S. economy likely slowed by hurricanes in third quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth probably slowed in the third quarter as hurricanes Harvey and Irma restrained consumer spending and undercut construction activity, but underlying momentum likely remained strong amid robust business investment on equipment.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, gross domestic product likely increased at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the July-September period after a brisk 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of third-quarter GDP growth on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). Without the hurricane-related disruptions, economists say third-quarter GDP growth would have either matched or beat the pace set in the April-June quarter.
""Despite the temporary disruption to construction and consumer spending that will be visible in the third quarter data, the real takeaway from the report will be how resilient overall U.S. GDP growth continues to be,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Economists estimate that Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida, chopped off at least one percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth. With post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already showing a rebound in activity, Friday's report will probably have no impact on monetary policy in the near term.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that economic growth in the third quarter ""will be held down"" by the severe disruptions caused by the hurricanes. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.
The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama's first term. 
Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump's tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies. Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.
TEMPORARY LIFT
""The absence of any fiscal policy change has so far neither supported nor hurt the economy and while any potential tax reform in the future might temporarily lift the growth rate to 3 percent, it will not materially alter the economy's long-term growth prospects,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hurt incomes and undercut retail sales in August, likely crimped consumer spending in the third quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is forecast slowing to below a 2.5 percent rate following a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter. 
The storms are also expected to have weighed on investment in nonresidential structures like oil and gas wells, which is forecast to have contracted.
Spending on homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, also probably took a hit from Harvey and Irma. Spending on residential construction is forecast to have declined for a second straight quarter.
But the impact of moderate consumer spending and weak residential and nonresidential construction investment was probably offset by continued gains in business spending on equipment, trade and an acceleration in inventory accumulation.
Business investment on equipment is expected to have increased for a fourth straight quarter and trade to have contributed to GDP growth three quarters in a row. 
Businesses likely boosted inventories in the third quarter in anticipation of strong demand. Economists estimate that inventory investment contributed as much as eight-tenths of a percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth. 

Inventories added just over a tenth of percent point to growth in the second quarter. Government investment is expected to have rebounded after two straight quarterly declines.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2017 12:45AM ET</span>",China's September industrial profits surge most in nearly six years,"By Lusha Zhang and Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits for China's industrial powerhouses surged the most in nearly six years in September as a government crackdown on air pollution sparked fears of winter supply shortages and sent prices of finished goods like steel and copper sharply higher.
Sustained earnings growth will give China's policymakers more room to restructure bloated and often inefficient state-owned enterprises, which dominate the industrial landscape and account for a hefty portion of the country's corporate debt.
Industrial profits in September rose 27.7 percent from a year earlier to 662.18 billion yuan ($99.46 billion), accelerating from a 24 percent jump in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Friday. 
That was the sharpest monthly gain since December 2011, when profits leapt 31.5 percent.
The NBS attributed the September surge to stronger growth in production and sales and higher prices for manufactured goods, as well as a pick-up in earnings in sectors such as electricity, alcohol and electronics.
""We predict the industrial sector will remain on a steady, improving trajectory in the fourth quarter,"" Zheng Lixin, a spokesman for the industry ministry, told a media briefing.
For the first nine months of the year, the firms notched up profits of 5.58 trillion yuan, a 22.8 percent jump from the same period last year and up a touch from January-August.
Industrial firms' liabilities increased 6.7 percent in September on-year, compared with a rise of 6.4 percent in the first eight months of the year.
While a year-long construction boom is starting to show signs of fatigue, still robust industrial earnings will be good news for the country's leaders who gathered for a key Communist Party Congress over the past week to set political and economic priorities for the next five years.
President Xi Jinping opened the gathering stressing the need to move from high-speed to high-quality growth. 
While reiterating a commitment to give market forces freer rein in the world's second-largest economy, Xi also said the government would strengthen the role of state firms, raising questions about whether Beijing will pursue painful reforms in the sector which some analysts say are long overdue. 
PRICES KEY TO PROFIT OUTLOOK
Market watchers had expected solid September earnings after producer prices rose by a higher-than-forecast 6.9 percent on-year, boosted by strong demand for building materials.
Most analysts have maintained those price gains and industrial profits would start to moderate in coming months as measures to cool China's heated housing market and a government crackdown on riskier lending starts to bite. 
But commodity prices got a fresh leg up in recent weeks as the government pressed ahead with efforts to reduce notorious winter smog, urging major northern industrial cities to slash steel output ahead of the official winter heating season.
That has spurred fears of shortages and pushed up steel prices, but is having the opposite effect on steelmaking raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal, which are sliding on worries about a supply glut.
China's steel output dropped in September from a record high in August as mills cut production in line with Beijing's campaign for clearer skies.
Beijing was already in the midst of a multi-year campaign to shutter older, inefficient plants and reduce profit-draining industrial overcapacity, though many analysts say they are merely being replaced with newer, cleaner factories and the country's excess capacity issue have not been fully addressed.
Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (SS:601600) announced a plan on Thursday to bring up to 16 billion yuan of investment into some subsidiaries after posting a more than 10-fold rise in nine-month profit. Chalco is the listed arm of China's biggest state-run aluminum firm, Chinalco.
""MAN OF STEEL"" 
A breakdown of the profit data showed heavy industry continued to reap most of the benefits from the building boom, which is also being driven by heavy government infrastructure spending.
Mining industry profits surged 473.8 percent in January-September on-year, and manufacturing profits rose 19.6 percent.
Earnings in the mining industry soared 5.9 times last month from a year earlier, but sectors such as electricity, gas and water production saw their profits fall 18.3 percent. 
China's economy has surprised analysts with robust growth so far this year, with the rebound in its industrial sector contributing to a reflationary pulse that has boosted manufacturing worldwide.
Though GDP growth slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in the third quarter, senior officials said last week that the economy is still on track to meet the official growth target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, despite the punishing war on pollution.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the economy will grow 6.8 percent this year, before slowing to 6.4 percent in 2018.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 10:44PM ET</span>",Japan consumer prices rise for ninth straight month; energy key driver,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices marked a ninth straight month of annual gains in September but failed to accelerate from the previous month, underscoring the central bank's huge task as it struggles to meet an ever-elusive 2 percent inflation target.
Most of September's scant inflation was driven by continued rises in energy costs, which were partly offset by falling cellphone bills - another sign that companies still baulk at raising prices for fear of stalling a fragile recovery in private consumption.
Still, the Bank of Japan is set to largely maintain its current inflation forecasts at a policy meeting next week, blaming stagnant inflation on factors such as corporate efforts to boost productivity.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, matching August but lower than a median market forecast of 0.8 percent.
""Private consumption was probably weak in July-September and gains in household income may have slowed due to weak summer bonus payments,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""There's still quite some distance from the BOJ's 2 percent target, so monetary policy will be steady for the time being.""
A 7.6 percent rise in energy prices made up most of the consumer price growth, a sign inflation was still driven by temporary factors rather than sustained strength in demand.
Stripping away the effect of fresh food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in September from a year ago, data from the internal affairs ministry showed.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were up 0.6 percent in October from a year earlier, against a median forecast for a 0.5 percent rise. It was the fastest annual pace since March 2015, a potential source of comfort for the BOJ.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.
Japan is experiencing near full employment, and wholesale prices rose in September at the fastest annual rate in almost nine years as raw material costs surged.
Some firms, such as brewer Asahi Group Holdings Ltd (T:2502) and restaurant chain Torikizoku Co (T:3193), have announced plans to raise prices.

But others remain cautious including Aeon Co Ltd (T:8267), Japan's biggest retailer by sales, which plans more price cuts to attract consumers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, suggesting the labor market continued to tighten after recent hurricane-related disruptions. 
Other reports on Thursday, however, offered a less favorable look at the economy. The goods trade deficit widened in September and retail inventories fell, prompting the Atlanta Federal Reserve to trim its third-quarter GDP growth estimate. In addition, signed contracts to buy previously-owned homes were unchanged last month.
""Firms remain unwilling to release labor. The labor market is very tight,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 223,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since March 1973. 
Economists had forecast claims rising to 235,000 in the latest week. They have declined from the almost three-year high of 298,000 hit at the start of September in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.
The impact of Harvey and Irma has largely dropped out of the claims data for the mainland United States. But Irma and Hurricane Maria continue to impact claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, now virtually isolated because of the destruction of infrastructure due to the storms.
A Labor Department official said claims data for the islands had continued to be estimated.
Last week marked the 138th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,000 to 239,500 last week. 
That suggests a sharp rebound in job growth in October after nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September. 
LABOR MARKET SLACK DIMINISHING
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 3,000 to 1.90 million in the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since December 1973.
The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 1.90 million, the lowest reading since January 1974. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which October's unemployment rate will be derived. 
The four-week average of continuing claims fell 40,500 between the September and October survey weeks, suggesting a further improvement in the unemployment rate as labor market slack continues to diminish. The job market strength supports the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the European Central Bank's announcement that it would extend its bond purchases at a reduced rate. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were largely unchanged. Stocks on Wall Street rose.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit rose 1.3 percent to $64.1 billion in September. Exports of goods increased $0.9 billion to $129.6 billion. Goods imports gained $1.7 billion to $193.7 billion amid a surge in capital and consumer goods imports, which likely reflects the economy's underlying strength.
The Commerce Department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent last month. But stocks of goods at retailers tumbled 1.0 percent, weighed down by a 2.6 percent dive in motor vehicle inventories. As a result, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate.
""The higher-than-expected trade deficit implies a lower contribution from the net exports,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""In addition, today's weak inventories data also imply a lower contribution from this subcomponent.""
The government will publish it's advance estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the April-June quarter.

A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed its pending home sale index was unchanged at more than a 2-1/2-year low in September. The index, which is based on signed home purchase contracts, fell 3.5 percent on an annual basis.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, was unchanged with a reading of 106.0. August's index was revised lower.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales edging up 0.2 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are viewed as a forward-looking indicator for the state of the housing market because they become sales one or two months later.
Although the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, the housing sector has faltered this year. Home sales have weakened amid tight inventories while builders have cited shortages of land and labor as a curb on construction.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales fell 3.5 percent overall and there were annual declines across all four of the nation's regions.
Compared with the prior month, pending sales for September rose 1.2 percent in the Northeast, 1.4 percent in the Midwest and 1.9 percent in the West.
""Activity is falling further behind last year's pace because new listings aren't keeping up with what's being sold,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
He added the situation will likely be further exacerbated as inventory starts to decline heading into the winter months.
The South saw declines of 2.3 percent in September, which the NAR largely attributed to the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

The index is now at its lowest reading since January 2015 (104.7), after having fallen 3.5% from a year ago it what was its fifth decline in the last six months.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun noted that it was difficult for many would-be home buyers to find a place.
“Demand exceeds supply in most markets, which is keeping price growth high and essentially eliminating any savings buyers would realize from the decline in mortgage rates from earlier this year,” he explained.
“While most of the country, except for the South, did see minor gains in contract signings last month, activity is falling further behind last year's pace because new listings aren't keeping up with what's being sold,” he explained.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in October likely fell close to 4 percent from the same month in 2016, though automakers' sales were buoyed by replacement of storm-damaged vehicles and record-high consumer discounts, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.
LMC maintained its full-year forecast for new vehicle sales in 2017 of 17.1 million units.
October U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.32 million units, a drop of almost 3.7 percent from 1.37 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 17 selling days of October. Automakers will release U.S. sales results for the month on Nov. 1.
Major automakers' U.S. new vehicle sales climbed to a monthly high for the year in September as consumers replaced flood-damaged cars after Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas in late August.[nL2N1ME0SD]
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for October will be 17.6 million vehicles, down more than 1 percent from 17.8 million units in the same month in 2016, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were also set to decline more than 4 percent in October.
U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy.
Consumer discounts hit a monthly record of $3,901, above the previous record of $3,835 set in October 2016.
""While incentives have declined from the record high set last month, the need to reduce inventory could push spending to a new all-time high level in the final months of the year,"" said Thomas King, J.D. Power's senior vice president for data and analytics.
Discounts as a percentage of the manufacturer's recommended sale price hit 10.5 percent in October, as they have for 15 of the last 16 months. Consumer discounts of more than 10 percent are considered unhealthy for automakers in the long term as they undermine resale values. 

Despite the lofty consumer discounts, the average new vehicle sold in October spent 75 days in inventory. This was the longest since July 2009, during the height of the Great Recession.

The CBI's monthly retail sales balance slid to -36 from September's two-year high of +42, marking its lowest level since March 2009.
The reading was far below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, most of whom expected a reasonably modest slowdown in growth.
While the CBI survey is volatile month-to-month, the three-month average balance for reported retail sales sank to -1 from +18 in September.
""It's clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist.
""While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand,"" she added.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 12:20AM ET</span>",Global growth? Sure. But still not much inflation pressure: Reuters poll,"By Anu Bararia and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The global economy is on its best roll in years and set to do better in 2018, but economists in Reuters polls around the world mostly said synchronous growth is not about to spawn significant price pressures.
Indeed, while several major central banks have shifted their bias away from ultra-easy monetary policy, with a few notable exceptions, inflation remains below their targets and is generally set to stay that way in the year ahead.
""It is becoming a familiar refrain. Another quarter, another set of upward revisions to our global growth forecasts, another downward revision to our global inflation forecasts,"" said Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC.
""But for developed world central banks, the task is getting ever harder. Tackling both low inflation and rising financial stability risks will demand a delicate balancing act by central banks and a more nuanced approach to inflation targeting if the global expansion is to be sustained.""
In Reuters surveys taken Oct 3-24 of more than 500 economists across Asia, Europe and the Americas, 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts for nearly three-quarters of the 48 economies polled were raised or left unchanged.
Global economic growth as a whole is forecast at 3.5 percent this year, steady compared with a poll published three months ago but a tad lower than the recently upgraded view from the International Monetary Fund.
While the consensus forecast for 2018 also remained steady at 3.6 percent, a majority who answered an additional question said the risk to their forecasts were skewed more to the upside.
However, respondents cut their 2017 inflation forecasts for nearly two-thirds of the economies surveyed.
Around 40 percent of the 134 economists who answered an extra question said global inflation pressures won't pick up until 2019 or beyond while a quarter said they were unlikely to rebound at all. The rest said they will before end-2018.
Erik Nelson, a strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York, said for their global growth forecasts, which are roughly in line with the Reuters consensus, inflation picking up faster than expected is the number one risk. 
""If inflation picks up a lot more than we are expecting, either in the United States or other economies, and central banks have to tighten a little more aggressively than we currently think, then there is probably some downside risk for those forecasts,"" Nelson said.
CHALLENGE FOR CENTRAL BANKS
Global central banks are at different stages in removing monetary policy accommodation, with persistently weak inflation nearly everywhere complicating decision-making.
""Low inflation expectations may have become self-fulfilling, so low inflation is likely more persistent than what central banks think,"" said Mikael Milhoj, senior analyst at Danske Bank.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates in December and twice next year, according to economists who largely said risks were skewed more to a slower pace of hikes. 
Uncertainty over who U.S. President Donald Trump will choose to head the Fed when Chair Janet Yellen's term ends on Feb. 1 has also clouded the outlook.
One of the candidates Trump has interviewed and is seriously considering according to reports, former Treasury undersecretary John Taylor, was deemed in a Reuters poll as likely to adopt the most radical change to current policy were he to be appointed.
After more than two years of purchases worth over 2 trillion euros in total, the European Central Bank is expected to announce at its meeting on Thursday that it will trim asset purchases to 40 billion euros a month from January and continue buying securities for another six or nine months. 
The rising risk of a disorderly Brexit won't deter the Bank of England - the only major central bank dealing with inflation running well above its target - from making what a majority of economists say will be a policy error by raising rates for the first time in a decade on Nov. 2. 
The Chinese economy, Asia's largest and the world's second-biggest, is forecast to expand 6.4 percent next year but faces twin risks of managing its massive debt pile as well as a highly inflated property market. 
Inflation there is expected to be more muted at 1.6 percent this year, down from last year's 2.0 percent, due to weak food price rises, but is expected to pick up to 2.2 percent in 2018.
Asia's third-largest economy, India, is predicted to grow 6.7 percent in 2018 - its weakest pace in four years - following disruptions caused by a government currency ban late last year and a new national tax launched in July.
And the biggest economy in Latin America, Brazil's, is likely to outpace Mexico for the first time in five years this year thanks to record-low interest rates. It will grow 2.3 percent in 2018, the poll found.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy clocked its fastest growth in seven years last quarter, as global demand for the country's electronics more than offset the impact of regional geopolitical strains on trade and boosted expectations for an imminent interest rate rise.
Gross domestic product rose 1.4 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter, preliminary numbers from the Bank of Korea showed on Thursday, significantly beating the 0.8 percent forecast in a Reuters survey and marking the biggest jump since a 1.7 percent spike in the second-quarter of 2010. Year-on-year growth accelerated to 3.6 percent in the third quarter from 2.7 percent in the second quarter, also beating forecasts.
The stellar numbers show Asia's fourth largest economy has been able to brush aside the impact of a diplomatic chill between China and South Korea over a U.S. missile defense system and wider concerns about North Korean military provocations.
They have also prompted several analysts to bring forward forecasts for a central bank rate hike.
Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment, now sees a 25 basis point hike in the bank's next policy meeting in November.
""This kind of robust growth is surely a rate-hike ingredient,"" Kim said. ""Shipments out of semiconductors and IT sector in general have been good, and it also seems exports of services also improved in the third quarter.""
The data pushed the won to an eight-week high in early trade on Thursday on the heightened rate hike expectations.
The BOK kept its policy rate unchanged at the record low of 1.25 percent last week but one dissenting policymaker called for a hike, prompting some speculation that a tightening could take place at the central bank's next policy meeting on Nov. 30.
The third quarter numbers are likely to bolster this view with growth now on track to hit the central bank's official forecast of a 3 percent expansion.
""Even if the economy contracts on-quarter, say by about 0.54 percent in the fourth quarter, we can achieve 3 percent expansion this year,"" Chung Kyu-il, director general for the Economics Statistics Department at the BOK said on the sidelines of a briefing in Seoul.
The central bank said last week that a row with China over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system could knock off 0.4 percentage points off the nation's economic growth this year.
China believes the missile defense system can be used to look inside its territory. An unofficial Chinese boycott against South Korean consumer products and tourism has hurt some segments of Korea's economy though shipments of other products such as memory chips remain very strong.
Exports grew 6.1 percent in the third quarter after declining 2.9 percent a quarter earlier, while private consumption growth slowed to 0.7 percent in the July-September period from 1.0 percent.
Exports, which account for about 40 percent of GDP, notched a ninth consecutive month of double-digit growth in September in value terms, the longest stretch of such expansion since 2001.
""It has been the semiconductors that mainly boosted production from manufacturing sector, but the third quarter also saw some extra boost from overseas sales of cars and petrochemical products,"" Chung said in a briefing.
The outlook for domestic demand is also improving for the year ahead, with the nation's minimum wage set for its biggest increase in nearly two decades next year.
Construction investment increased 1.5 percent, expanding even after the government's August announcement of tough new housing market rules, which included a hike in capital gains taxes for owners of multiple homes and new curbs on mortgages.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK retailers cut jobs at fastest rate since 2008: BRC,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers cut jobs over the past three months at the fastest rate since comparable records began in 2008, due to technological change and rising employment costs, the British Retail Consortium said on Thursday.
The BRC, which represents major retailers, said its members employed 3.0 percent fewer staff in the third quarter of this year than during the same time in 2016, and total hours worked fell by 4.2 percent year-on-year.
Both were the steepest falls since the BRC started collecting records in 2008, when Britain was in the middle of its sharpest recession in decades.
This contrasts with the picture in the broader economy, where the unemployment rate is its lowest since 1975 and job creation has been strong, albeit partly at the expense of wages.
Still, the BRC report chimed with a European Commission survey last month that showed British retailers' expectations for employment sank to their lowest since late 2011.
""The pace of job reductions in the retail industry is gathering steam,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
""Behind this shrinking of the workforce is both a technological revolution in retail, which is reducing demand for labor, and government policy, which is driving up the cost of employment,"" she added.
Retail, which accounts for just under 10 percent of jobs in Britain, has a lot of low-paid jobs that have been affected by rapid rises in the minimum wage in recent years, as well as a new government training levies and pension requirements.
High-street retailers also face stiff competition from online stores, which typically need fewer staff, and supermarkets have increasingly been switching to customers scanning their own shopping, supervised by a handful of staff.
 Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY), Britain's second biggest supermarket group behind  Tesco  (L:TSCO), said last week it was seeking to cut up to 2,000 jobs, mainly in its payroll and human resources departments.
One silver lining of the fall in jobs was an increase in average pay for staff who remained, as productivity improved, the BRC said - a trend at odds with the lacklustre performance on jobs and productivity in other British industries.
""The challenge for retailers will be in maintaining the pace of productivity improvement as they come up against shortages of the skills needed for a new, digital-dependent industry,"" Dickinson said.

Britain's economy suffered a weak first half to the year, as higher inflation hurt consumer spending, and many businesses have been cautious about investment due to uncertainty about the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union in 2019.
The NHBC data suggests the construction industry may be heading for an upturn later this year, after a weak third quarter in which annual growth slowed to 2.8 percent from 4.1 percent, according to official figures.
Britain has a long-term housing shortage, especially in southern England, and earlier this month Prime Minister Theresa May pledged a further 10 billion pounds ($13.3 billion) to the Help to Buy program which subsidizes new construction.
There was also positive news for commercial property. A quarterly survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that demand for commercial property from both tenants and investors picked up modestly over the past 12 months.
The strongest demand was for industrial sites, while appetite for offices was flat and retail demand fell.
Both the NHBC and RICS surveys showed similar regional patterns. Activity was weakest in London, where housing starts were down by more than a third over the past year and the highest proportion of surveyors judged commercial property to be overvalued.
The biggest rises in house-building registrations was in Scotland, with large jumps too in northeast and central England, as well as Wales.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 06:13PM ET</span>",Brazil signals record low rates with slower cuts ahead,"By Silvio Cascione and Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank slowed the pace of monetary easing on Wednesday but signaled it remained likely to cut interest rates to a record low next month, as policymakers seek to boost an incipient economic recovery with inflation under control.
The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, cut the benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points to 7.50 percent, after four consecutive cuts of 100 basis points. The decision was widely expected by economists polled by Reuters.
The bank repeated language from its previous meeting recommending a moderate reduction in the pace of easing going forward, leading analysts to predict a 50-point cut in December. That would take the Selic rate to a record low of 7.0 percent.
Guidance for early 2018 nevertheless remained up in the air. Economists diverged about the potential meaning of the bank's decision to remove a reference to a gradual end to rate cuts from the post-meeting statement.
""The doors appear open for an additional cut by the following meeting, in February,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists wrote in a report forecasting the Selic rate would fall to 6.5 percent in early 2018. Others, such as UBS economist Fabio Ramos, said the statement backs up the view that the December cut will be the last in the current cycle.
The Selic rate has fallen from 14.25 percent just a year ago. Since then, Brazil's economy has resumed growth after two years of deep recession in 2015 and 2016 that shed nearly 3 million jobs and left huge idle industrial capacity.
Inflation has plunged from double-digits to less than 3 percent, far below the official target of 4.5 percent, and is forecast by the central bank to stay around the goal through the end of 2019.

""Whether the bank cuts the Selic below 7 percent will depend on the short-term outlook, which seems relatively benign from our standpoint,"" said Luciano Sobral, an economist with Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 12:29PM ET</span>","U.S. business spending on equipment robust, new home sales surge","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in September and shipments rose for an eighth straight month, pointing to robust business spending that should help to mitigate the impact on the economy from the hurricanes.
Other data on Wednesday showed new single-family home sales vaulting to a near 10-year high last month. The signs of strong business investment on equipment in the third quarter and a pick-up in the housing market supported views the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December.
""The positive reports keep the economy's wheels turning, and the Fed on track for another rate hike this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Businesses don't invest in the future if they don't think consumers will be there to buy their goods and services.""
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.3 percent increase in August. 
Economists had forecast orders of these so-called core capital goods increasing 0.5 percent last month after a previously reported 1.1 percent jump in August. Core capital goods orders advanced 3.8 percent year-on-year. 
Shipments of core capital goods climbed 0.7 percent after soaring 1.2 percent in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
Core capital goods shipments have now increased for eight straight months. Business investment on equipment stumbled in late 2015 and much of last year as declining oil prices hurt profits. Spending is in part being supported by a weakening dollar, strengthening global growth and steady oil prices.
The dollar briefly rose against a basket of currencies after the data as traders anticipated an interest rate hike in December, which would be the third this year. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rising to a seven-month high. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower after lackluster earnings reports from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
Business spending on equipment probably contributed to economic growth in the third quarter, which could help to cushion the blow on GDP from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Economists estimate that Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida, sliced off as much as one percentage point from third-quarter GDP.
UPSIDE RISK TO THIRD-QUARTER GDP ESTIMATE
The government is due to publish its advance GDP estimate for the July-September quarter on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy probably grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the July-September period, slowing down from the second quarter's brisk 3.1 percent pace.
But the Commerce Department report, which also showed inventories increasing 0.6 percent in September, the largest gain since June 2015, suggested third-quarter economic growth could surprise on the upside. 
The economy's improving prospects were also underscored by a second report from the Commerce Department showing new home sales surged 18.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month amid an increase in all four regions. 
That was the highest level since October 2007 and the percent gain was the largest since January 1992. New home sales are, however, volatile month-to-month and last month's jump likely exaggerates the health of the housing market, which has struggled for much of this year.
""There are several reasons...to be reluctant to believe the upbeat message from today's home sales report,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""This recent surge in activity has not been evident in a number of the other housing indicators that we track.""
Strong business spending on equipment is helping to support manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, shot up 2.2 percent last month amid a 5.1 percent rise in demand for transportation equipment. 

Durable goods orders increased 2.0 percent in August. Unfilled orders for durable goods increased 0.2 percent in September after being unchanged the prior month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's sluggish economy perked up slightly during the past three months, an unexpected boost that clears the way for the Bank of England to raise interest rates next week for the first time in a decade.
While falling short of the strong growth rates enjoyed by euro zone countries earlier this year, British economic growth picked up to 0.4 percent in the July-September period from 0.3 percent in the second quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.
Sterling climbed almost a full percentage point against the U.S. dollar on the figures, which beat the average forecast for growth of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. 
British five-year government bond yields also rose to their highest since last year's vote to leave the European Union as markets anticipated a quicker pace of BoE rate rises next year.
Britain performed much better than most economists expected immediately after last year's vote to leave the European Union, and it was one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in 2016.
But it slipped to the bottom of the pack earlier this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012, largely due to higher inflation caused by the pound's fall after the Brexit vote, at a time when its peers have enjoyed robust growth, 
While Wednesday's figures are a small boost for under-pressure finance minister Philip Hammond ahead of his November budget, they do not alter the broad picture of an economy dogged by poor productivity and squeezed living standards.
""Despite the weak outlook, the Bank of England will now almost certainly raise the Bank Rate by 25 basis points ... on 2nd November,"" said Daniel Vernazza, chief UK economist at UniCredit.
A Reuters poll published on Tuesday showed the BoE is widely expected to raise rates to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent on Nov. 2, due to concerns that the economy cannot grow as fast as it used to without generating excess inflation. [BOE/INT]
Financial markets nudged up the chance of a move to nearly 90 percent from just over 80 percent before the data.
Last month the BoE said Wednesday's preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was likely to show 0.3 percent growth, though it might be stronger due to improving consumer demand.
In the past, Britain's economy typically grew by 0.5-0.6 percent a quarter but the BoE and other economists have indicated that the sustainable growth rate may have fallen.
FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY
Hammond told broadcasters the growth figures were ""solid"" and proof of the fundamental strength of an economy that since the referendum had often made forecasters look too pessimistic.
In a separate statement, he said he was focused on boosting productivity - arguably Britain's biggest economic problem - in order to create more higher-wage jobs.
Next month's budget would consider ways to support high-growth firms short of finance, the housing sector and consumers, but the economic situation placed limits on what could be done, Hammond added.
Britain's budget watchdog has said it expects to chop its forecasts for productivity growth in coming years, suggesting the economy will have less room to grow without generating inflation - a diagnosis shared by BoE Governor Mark Carney.
In the short-term, a further argument in favor of higher rates might come from solid bank lending figures from industry association UK Finance.
Nonetheless, most economists polled by Reuters think it would be a mistake for the BoE to hike interest rates now, in part because of the economic uncertainty generated by the Brexit process.
The ONS data showed the vast services industry was behind the bulk of Britain's economic expansion in the third quarter, but manufacturing also contributed, helped by a rebound in car production.
In year-on-year terms, third-quarter growth was unchanged at 1.5 percent, also slightly stronger than analysts had expected.
Britain's dominant services maintained its momentum from the previous quarter, the ONS said, while industrial output expanded at its fastest rate in more than a year.
Construction continued to struggle, however, contracting by 0.7 percent on the quarter - its sharpest fall since the third quarter of 2012.
""We would urge the (BoE) to proceed with caution on raising rates, as tightening monetary policy amid the current economic and political uncertainty could weaken growth,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.

The preliminary estimates of GDP do not include a breakdown of spending, and are heavily based on estimated data.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales surged 18.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month amid an increase in all four regions. 
That was the highest level since October 2007 and followed August's upwardly revised sales pace of 561,000 units. 
The percent gain was the largest since January 1992. August's sales pace was previously reported at 560,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11 percent of overall home sales, falling 0.9 percent to a pace of 555,000 units last month.
New home sales, which are drawn from permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales soared 17.0 percent on a year-on-year basis in September. 
The housing market has trod water for much of this year, amid shortages of homes available for sale, skilled labor and suitable land for building. 
Activity was also hampered by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which weighed on homebuilding in September and hurt sales of previously owned homes in the South. Housing is expected to have been a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. 
In September, new single-family homes sales raced to a more than 9-1/2 year high in the Northeast. Sales in the South hit their highest level since July 2007. There were also strong gains in the West and Midwest last month. 
More than two-thirds of the new homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be started. 
With sales surging in September, the inventory of new homes on the market was unchanged at 279,000 units. At September's robust sales pace it would take 5.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.0 months in August.

A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A euphoric mood among German constructors and manufacturers drove business confidence to an all-time high in October, a survey showed, reflecting optimism that an upswing in Europe's largest economy has further to run.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Wednesday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 116.7 from an upwardly revised 115.3 in September.
Ifo said a continuing recovery in the euro zone was helping German exporters feel more positive. This was especially true for capital goods manufacturers and mechanical engineering firms. 
""Companies are very optimistic about the months ahead. They also upwardly revised their very favorable assessments of the current business situation,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""Germany's economy is powering ahead.""
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said the economy was unfazed by complex coalition talks that Chancellor Angela Merkel has embarked on with two other parties after her conservative bloc lost ground in a national election last month.
The record high reading, which came after two consecutive monthly falls, beat a Reuters consensus forecast of 115.2.
Wohlrabe added that companies also appeared to be taking in their stride Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union, a standoff between the Spanish government and the region of Catalonia and U.S. tax reforms.
'ECB DRIVING GROWTH'
If the Ifo indicator rose again in November, a change in the growth forecast for Europe's largest economy could be needed, Wohlrabe said.
Leading German economic institutes this year raised its 2017 forecast to 1.9 percent, from 1.5 percent previously.
A survey published by His Markit this week showed Germany's private sector posted the highest increase in new orders in 6-1/2 years in October.
Record-high employment, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs are driving a consumer-led upswing that helped Merkel win a fourth term in office on Sept. 24.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) chief economist Joerg Kraemer said the positive cycle in Germany should continue thanks to the ultra-low interest rate environment created by the European Central Bank.

""We are not in a normal economic cycle,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""There are no disruptions (expected) as the monetary policy of the ECB, which is too loose for Germany, will push the economy forward for another couple of years.""

Li Xiaochao, deputy director at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said the current methodology for calculating housing prices has met with ""new challenges and difficulties"", after a work meeting with a visiting German delegation this week, according to a statement posted on the agency's website.
Li did not specify what the challenges were, but said China would further improve the housing price statistics system and calculation methodology to ""better facilitate state macro-control in the property market"".
He did not give a time table but added the changes would be made as China actively learns from the experiences of the European Union and Germany.
China first established the real estate price survey system in 1997 and has since introduced two significant changes in its methodology, including extending the number of cities it covers. The NBS now compiles and publishes every month a property price index that covers 70 large- and medium-sized cities.
The country's property prices have soared since late 2015, led by a price surge in its biggest cities which has since spilled into smaller centers. More than 45 major cities have imposed measures to cool overheating since October 2016.
Critics have long questioned the reliability of China's official housing price index, as there has been a considerable discrepancy between the official index and people's general perception of price increases.

Prices for new homes in September rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier, slowing from an 8.3 percent increase in August, as government measures to cool a long property boom take hold.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices were surprisingly tame last quarter while core inflation stayed below target for almost a second full year, leading investors to pare back the already slim chance of a rate hike for months to come.
The local dollar dived to a 4-1/2 month trough as the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent for the year to September, below market forecasts of 2.0 percent.
Underlying inflation averaged around 1.85 percent, again missing estimates and actually a touch slower than in the second quarter.
Core inflation has now undershot the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) long-term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent for seven straight quarters, the longest period on record.
""Consumer prices are amazingly benign across the economy,"" said Matt Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment strategy for fund manager Perpetual Investments.
""That's because wages growth is at an all-time low, and households are saving more to pay down their debt,"" he said. ""It tells me that the RBA is on hold not only in 2017 but also all of 2018.""
Investors battered the Australian dollar <AUD=D4>, sending it sliding 0.7 percent to $0.7716, its lowest since mid-July.
Interest rate futures <0#YIB:> moved to further push out the likely timing of any hike. A rise in rates to 1.75 percent is now not fully priced in until November next year.
DISINFLATIONARY PRESSURES
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported its headline CPI rose 0.6 percent in the third quarter, from the second quarter when it edged up just 0.2 percent.
That missed market forecasts for a 0.8 percent increase, with vegetables, petrol and telecoms all falling in price.
Supermarket giant Coles on Wednesday blamed a slowdown in its sales growth on a rapid fall in the price of fresh produce and fierce retail competition.
The Wesfarmers-owned (AX:WES) retailer is cutting prices to win market share from rivals, while margins were further compressed by ""significant"" produce price deflation.
Energy prices saw the single biggest increase, rising 8.9 percent in the third quarter and adding 0.25 percentage points to the overall increase in CPI.
Economists see that trend as more of a tax on consumer spending than a sign of overheating demand, greatly lessening the need for an interest rate response by the RBA.
""This is the wrong type of inflation, in that the increases are in non-discretionary, regulatory type components,"" said Su-Lin Ong, Sydney-based senior economist at RBC Capital.
""You might say core inflation has probably troughed but it is showing little signs of momentum. The odds are that it will stay around these levels for some time.""
The inexorable rise of electricity costs is largely a function of policy failure and has become a major political headache for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
After months of prevarication, the government recently outlined a plan for a national energy guarantee that essentially put the onus on utilities to fix the problem.
So far, the plan has been long on aspirations and short on detail and analysts suspect energy prices will continue to rise in the near term.
Indeed, policy makers have repeatedly stressed they will look through the impact of energy prices on inflation and that any move in rates is still ""some time"" away.

""The key takeout from the Q3 result is that price pressures remain comatose with no need for the RBA to reach for the rate hike lever anytime soon,"" said John Peters, a senior economist at Commonwealth Bank.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's economy will likely grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll showed, as a currency ban and the new goods and services tax (GST) have disrupted business activity and dampened consumer demand.
Asia's third-largest economy will grow at 6.7 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2018, the slowest since the new methodology of measuring gross domestic product (GDP) was introduced in the 2014-15 fiscal year, according to the latest poll of 30 economists.
The poll was taken on Oct. 12-24, closing just before India announced a $32.43 billion plan to recapitalise state banks, a bid to tackle a major drag on the economy.
While the latest poll's number for this year matches the International Monetary Fund's toned-down forecast - that was 7.2 percent earlier - it is a sharp decline from 7.3 percent the July Reuters poll showed. 
But despite the broad and marked slowdown expected in economic activity, India's projected growth rate will be second to the world's fastest growing major economy - China - if predictions are met. [ECILT/CN]
A majority of economists said the risk to their already lower outlook for Indian growth this fiscal year is skewed further to the downside as stressed corporate balance sheets prevent a recovery in private capital spending and mounting bad loans at Indian banks remain a burden.
All but three of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said the government had imposed too many sweeping changes for the economy in a short period of time, referring to demonetization and the GST, and that has lowered growth expectations.
""Demonetization was unnecessary and had a huge disruptive effect. Even before the economy could recover from that shock, came (the) GST,"" said Kunal Kundu, vice president and India economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""More importantly, the government was not prepared adequately enough, thereby transmitting further shock to the slowing economy."" 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision last November to scrap high-value old banknotes wiped out about 86 percent of currency in circulation virtually overnight in an economy which is largely cash-based.
That has hurt consumer spending, which powers more than half of the $2 trillion economy.
But just when some improvement in data raised hopes that the impact of the cash clampdown had been absorbed, confusion among businesses on pricing goods and services after the July 1 implementation of GST has impacted activity.
The economy grew at 5.7 percent annually in the April-June quarter, its lowest level in more than three years and well below expectations.
However, nearly three-fourths of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said India does not need a stimulus package and instead should focus on fiscal discipline which is vital for investment from outside the country to flow in.
""There is limited scope for any stimulus when the budget fiscal deficit projections will anyways be breached on account of revenue shortfall,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
Despite bleak growth expectations, the Reserve Bank of India is forecast to keep key policy rates on hold through mid-2019, focusing on anchoring inflation.
The latest Reuters poll predicted retail inflation to average 3.5 percent this fiscal year, unchanged from the July median but below the RBI's medium-term target of 4.0 percent.
Inflation was expected to average 4.5 percent in 2018-2019, compared to 4.3 percent in the previous poll.
""With inflation trending up directionally and RBI's insistence on 4 percent target on a durable basis, a convincing case for a rate cut appears less plausible,"" said Madhavi Arora, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 12:10AM ET</span>",Brazil central bank set to taper rate cuts near record low,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank is set to slow the pace of interest rate cuts on Wednesday, taking its benchmark rate just above an all-time low as the economy finally starts to emerge from recession.
All but one of 54 economists polled by Reuters last week expected the bank, following its two-day monetary policy meeting, to cut its Selic rate by 75 basis points to 7.50 percent after four consecutive 100-basis-point cuts. 
The announcement will be made at 1820 local time (2020 GMT). 
The pace of reductions, along with what some expect to be a hawkish post-meeting statement, should signal the imminent end of an aggressive easing cycle that has brought the Selic rate down from 14.25 percent just a year ago.
""We expect the statement to indicate in a strong way that the rate-cutting cycle is set to end before year-end,"" wrote Cristiano Oliveira, chief economist at Banco Fibra. 
Most economists expect a final 50-basis-point cut in December to 7.00 percent, below a record low of 7.25 percent, although a sizeable minority think rates could go as low as 6.50 percent in coming months. 
Brazil's economy has resumed growth this year after two years of deep recession in 2015 and 2016 that left a huge idle capacity. Inflation has plunged from double-digits to less than 3 percent, far below the official target of 4.5 percent.

The large output gap has left plenty of room for the economy to grow without fanning price rises. The growth rate may surpass 2 percent next year. However, economists such as Santander's Rodolfo Margato do not expect the economy to face rising inflation pressures until late 2019 even as interest rates remain at stimulative levels, he wrote in a report.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2017 11:30PM ET</span>","BOJ sees less to fret about low inflation, policy on hold","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's central bank is set to roughly maintain its price forecasts at its policy meeting next week and blame stagnant inflation on factors like corporate efforts to boost productivity, signaling that it will hold off on expanding stimulus for the time being.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is also likely to stress that the bank is nowhere near dialing back its massive stimulus program, with inflation distant from its 2 percent target.
The rate review comes in the wake of premier Shinzo Abe's victory in a weekend election, which heightened expectations the BOJ's ultra-loose policy - a key pillar of his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies - will be sustained regardless of who succeeds Kuroda when his term ends next April.
""There's a strong chance Kuroda will be reappointed, which means the BOJ's policy framework won't change much,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""The BOJ's next move could be to raise its long-term yield target, but that won't happen at least until late next year.""
At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.
The market's focus would be on whether Goushi Kataoka, a board newcomer who voted against keeping policy steady last month, will propose expanding stimulus.
While any such proposal is likely to be voted down by others who see no need to ramp up monetary support amid a strengthening economy, it may expose a fresh rift in the board on the future direction of monetary policy.
STRUCTURAL FACTORS
In a quarterly review of its projections due on Tuesday, the BOJ is seen slightly trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from an estimate of 1.1 percent made in July, said sources familiar with its thinking.
The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit its target by March 2020, they said.
The BOJ currently projects inflation to hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018, well above a Reuters poll of 0.8 percent, and 1.8 percent the following year.
With the economy in good shape, BOJ officials have recently explained slow inflation as being the result of companies' efforts to avert wage hikes by automating and streamlining operations.
While such efforts may weigh on prices in the short-term, they would eventually boost inflation and Japan's long-term growth potential by enhancing productivity, they say.
""We shouldn't be too negative about the fact wage and inflation growth remains subdued,"" BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai said last week, a view Kuroda is likely to echo in his post-meeting news conference.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

But core consumer prices rose just 0.7 percent in August from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target, keeping the bank under pressure to maintain ultra-easy policy even as its U.S. and European peers begin to dial back stimulus.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2017 11:20PM ET</span>","Australia economy energized by jobs, infrastructure surge: poll","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy looks set to pick up pace over the next two years as surging employment bolsters incomes and state governments splurge on infrastructure, though a mountain of household debt still looms as a concern.
Economists polled by Reuters estimated Australia's A$1.7 trillion ($1.33 trillion) of annual gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.3 percent in 2017, unchanged from July's forecast.
The economy expanded by only 1.8 percent in the year to June but mainly due to a weather-beaten contraction in the third quarter of 2016. Once that negative drops out of the calculation, the pace should spring ahead.
Growth was then seen accelerating to 2.8 percent for both 2018 and 2019, extending Australia's run of 26 years without a technical recession.
The upbeat outlook is reflected by surveys of business, which have been showing the best conditions since before the global financial crisis, with sales, profits and jobs all improving.
""Leading indicators from the surveys clearly point to an improving economy, at least in the near-to-medium term,"" said NAB chief economist, Alan Oster.
""A positive by-product of that has been solid outcomes for hiring intentions and capex plans for the year ahead.""
The labor market has been a stand out performer with a huge 372,000 jobs created in the year to September, the fastest pace since 2008. That has supported incomes and spending in the face of unusually subdued wage deals.
Healthcare, education and construction have all been major generators of jobs, driven in part by increased public spending. Australia's state governments have been particularly active in infrastructure investment and helped revive economic growth in the June quarter after a slow start to the year.
Kristina Clifton, a senior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, estimates infrastructure work will add up to 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in the year to June 2018 and generate around 36,000 new jobs.
Yet stubborn softness in wages has kept inflation in check, suggesting there is still plenty of slack in the economy.
Analysts expected consumer price inflation to run at 2.0 percent this year, the very bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2-3 percent target range, and to pick up only gradually to 2.3 percent by 2019.
Such a benign background gives the central bank plenty of scope to keep policy loose and markets are not pricing in a rise in the current 1.45 percent cash rate until late 2018.
That is likely just as well since households are sitting on record levels of, mainly mortgage, debt and many could not bear a sharp rise in borrowing costs.

Total mortgage originations are forecast to decline to $1.60 trillion next year, lower than an expected $1.69 trillion this year, the Washington-based industry group said.
Loan volume would rebound to $1.64 trillion in 2019, it said.
The amount of new loans to refinance a home was expected to drop to $430 billion, down 28.3 percent from 2017, while the amount of new mortgages to buy a home will likely increase by 7.3 percent to $1.2 trillion, MBA said.
For 2019, MBA forecast purchase loan volume to total $1.24 trillion and refinancing volume to fall again at $395 billion.
""The housing market has been hamstrung by insufficient supply, with inventories of homes remarkably low given the home price growth we have experienced,"" MBA's chief economist Michael Fratantoni said in a statement.
""The job market remains strong, demographic trends are quite favorable, mortgage credit is becoming more available to qualified borrowers, and home prices should continue to rise,"" he added.
Home borrowing costs will likely rise as the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates three times next year and twice in 2019, but they would remain near the low end of their historical range, according to Fratantoni.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) should stay below 3 percent by the end of 2018, while the interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will likely hold below 5 percent, he said.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to 55.7 in October, from the prior reading of 54.8. That was its highest level since January.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The research group also said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased to 55.9 in October, from the prior month’s reading of 55.3.
Analysts had expected the reading to rise to just 55.6.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
IHS Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) advanced to 54.5 in October from the prior month’s final reading of 53.1.
Economists had estimated that it would rise to only 53.5.
As a negative, IHS Markit noted that growth of overall new business volumes moderated further from the two-year peak seen in August.
“This reflected a slowdown in the service sector, as manufacturing firms reported the strongest rise in new work since March,” these experts explained.
IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore said the surveys pointed to a strong start to the fourth quarter.
“Resilient service sector growth and an encouraging rebound in manufacturing production combined to generate one of the sharpest rises in private sector output for two and-a-half years during October,” Moore said.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1757 from around 1.1754 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3153 from 1.3148 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 113.83 compared to 113.95 before the release.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 93.78 compared to 93.80 before the report.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Private sector growth across the euro zone slowed more sharply than predicted this month, a survey showed on Tuesday, but stayed strong even though firms increased prices at the steepest rate in over six years.
IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for October, seen as a good guide to economic growth, fell to 55.9 from September's 56.7, still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
October's reading was below all expectations in a Reuters poll, which had forecast a more modest dip to 56.5, but was still much higher than it has averaged in recent years.
""It's a carrying on of the recent story where everything is going along quite nicely, it's more positive news for the euro zone economy,"" said Andrew Harker, an associate director at IHS Markit.
""France and Germany were both the growth drivers. Outside of that the rate of expansion eased off a bit but was still solid.""
Harker said the PMI, if maintained, pointed to fourth quarter economic growth of 0.6-0.7 percent, faster than the 0.5 percent a recent Reuters poll predicted.
The robust growth came as firms jacked up prices. An output price index climbed to 53.3 from 52.7, its highest reading since June 2011.
Inflation has stubbornly refused to reach the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling but a recent Reuters poll predicted policymakers will say on Thursday they plan to start trimming monthly asset purchases in January.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry sank to 54.9 from 55.8, missing all expectations in a Reuters poll that predicted a reading of 55.6.
But suggesting firms think the slowdown won't last, they hired staff at the second fastest rate in over nine years. The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.7 and has only been higher once -- in March -- since early 2008.
Manufacturing growth accelerated and the PMI came in at 58.6 compared to September's 58.1, its highest since February 2011.
It was forecast at 57.8 and was better than anyone polled by Reuters predicted.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dipped to 58.7 from 59.2.
Indicating the momentum might continue, new orders picked up. The sub index was 58.7 compared to September's 58.5,

Demand for loans has been rising steadily for years as access to credit became easier, driven in part by increased competition among banks and cheap wholesale and retail funding.
In the last three months of the year, banks are set to keep their credit standards on corporate loans broadly unchanged but households' access to consumer credit and housing loans may ease further, the ECB said based on its poll of 134 banks.
In the third quarter, credit standards for corporate loans remained broadly unchanged, despite expectations for easing but they eased for mortgages and consumer loans, the ECB added.
""Competitive pressure, banks' risk perceptions, and cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had an easing impact on credit standards on loans to enterprises in the third quarter of 2017, while banks' risk tolerance had a tightening impact,"" the survey showed.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy will likely grow 6.8 percent in 2017, topping the state target and accelerating for the first time in seven years, a Reuters poll showed, as Beijing walks a tightrope by containing debt and property risks without stunting economic growth.
Still, growth in the world's second-largest economy is projected to slow to 6.4 percent in 2018, the Reuters poll of more than 65 economists showed, as the property curbs and efforts to deal with debt risks are expected to gain more traction. 
China's property investment and construction are seen slowing as more cities try to curb surging housing prices, while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs and a crackdown on pollution hurts some factories.
Chinese economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to cool to 6.7 percent from a year earlier, but the full-year growth is expected at 6.8 percent, according to the poll. 
In 2016, China's economic growth slowed to a 26-year low of 6.7 percent. The growth pace has inched down every year since 2011. 
China's annual economic growth rate eased to 6.8 percent in July-September from 6.9 percent in the second quarter as the property sector cooled while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs. 
""As overall GDP growth still remains above the government's target of 'around 6.5 percent', we expect policy makers to maintain a tightening bias,"" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a note. 
""Looking ahead, we expect to see weaker growth, mainly on the investment front, as the impact of tighter financial conditions start to emerge.""
The forecasts for this year and in 2018 were both more optimistic than the polling results in July.
GRADUAL SLOWDOWN
China's economy has defied expectations of a marked slowdown this year due to a improving global demand for its goods, sustained state infrastructure spending and stronger corporate earnings boosted by soaring factory price rises, analysts said.
In the opening speech of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress this week, President Xi Jinping said China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth.
Analysts are looking to the annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is usually held in December, for signals on the 2018 growth target and policy initiatives.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects China to keep its annual growth target at around 6.5 percent in 2018.
Analysts believe the PBOC will keep benchmark lending rates unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the second quarter of 2019, the Reuters poll showed. 
They have pushed back their expectations on a cut in the amount of cash that banks are required hold as reserves, or the reserve requirement ratio (RRR).
The central bank is expected to cut the RRR for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) in the second quarter of 2018 to 16.5 percent, versus the July poll's prediction for the 50 bps cut in the first quarter of next year.
In late September, the central bank cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves (RRR) for the first time since February 2016. The move, effective in January, offers an earnings boost to banks if they lend more to struggling smaller firms and the private sector.
Analysts expect annual consumer inflation to be more muted at 1.6 percent in 2017, down from last year's 2 percent due to weak food inflation. But the rate could pick up to 2.2 percent in 2018, the poll showed.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2017 02:20AM ET</span>",China's home price growth steadies in September as speculative curbs weigh,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices registered a second straight month of weak growth in September, with prices in the biggest markets slipping and gains in smaller cities slowing as government measures to cool a long property boom took hold. 
China's housing market has been on a near two-year tear, giving the economy a major boost but stirring fears of a property bubble even as authorities work to contain risks from a rapid build-up in debt.
While monthly price rises peaked in September 2016 at 2.1 percent nationwide, they have softened only begrudgingly since then, regaining momentum as buyers shrugged off each new wave of measures to curb speculation. 
Analysts say more tightening could still be expected in lower-tier cities with relatively fast price gains, as critics argue China's ever-growing administrative control over its property market has only reaffirmed speculator views that prices will remain steady.
""China's property prices are still rising even as sales are falling off a cliff, which suggests the market still sees property as an investment product in the belief that the government won't let prices fall,"" said Yi Xianrong, a Professor of Economics at Qingdao University. 
Still, signs of a more stable and less frothy housing market for now will be welcome to the country's leaders as they attend a critical Communist Party Congress to set political and economic priorities for the next five years.
President Xi Jingping opened the twice-a-decade gathering last week, stressing the need to move from high-speed to high-quality growth. 
Average new home prices rose 0.2 percent month-on-month in September, the same rate as in August when prices rose at the slowest rate in seven months, according to Reuters calculations from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data out on Monday.
""The curbs are in general still intensifying, which have gradually impacted property buyers' expectations,"" said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with Centaline, a property agency. 
New home prices rose 6.3 percent year-on-year in September, decelerating from August's 8.3 percent increase, partly thanks to last September's high base.
Higher prices are also eating up more of home buyers' disposable income, which could dampen future demand.
The head of the central bank warned last week that China's household debt is rising too quickly, and some analysts suspect a recent burst of consumer loans points to the illicit use of loans for property investment.
As mega-cities like Beijing imposed increasingly stringent measures, speculators have moved to smaller centers this year where local governments offer cheap credit and impose few restrictions in the hopes of clearing a glut of unsold homes.
Prices for new private homes in China's top-tier cities fell 0.2 percent in September versus a 0.3 percent decline in August, the NBS said in a note accompanying the data. 
In southern boomtown Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, prices stabilized after a drop of 0.4 percent in August. 
However, some second- and third-tier centers such as the southern town of Guilin have also been forced to impose curbs in recent months, banning some buyers from quickly ""flipping"" properties.
Tier-3 cities rose 0.2 percent from a 0.4 percent increase in August, the NBS said in the note. 
More curbs are likely to be introduced in lower-tier cities, some analysts say. Yan Yuejin, an analyst with Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, said smaller provincial capitals with faster gains in recent months such as Guiyang and Shenyang could be tightening controls in the fourth quarter.
While market watchers do not anticipate significant price declines let alone a crash, weakness in property and construction is starting to drag on broader economic growth.
Data last week showed GDP growth eased to 6.8 percent last quarter from 6.9 percent in the first half, with a marked deceleration in the property sector.
Property sales dropped for the first time in more than 2 1/2 years in September and housing starts slowed sharply.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported a monthly price increase for new homes, although the total dropped to 44 in September from 46 in August.
China's housing minister said on Sunday that property sales will slow in the fourth quarter but prices will remain stable.

Wang Menghui, head of the housing and urban-rural development ministry, said the government will keep measures consistent and not loosen controls, a pattern that has been seen before in China when prices start to soften more quickly than intended.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2017 08:20PM ET</span>",UK households' morale and rate hike expectations rise - IHS Markit,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British households' financial worries have eased to their lowest since June, despite the prospect of higher Bank of England interest rates and a reliance on borrowing to make up for falling employment income, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit Household Finance Index rose to 43.8 in October from 42.8 in September, its highest since June, and marking a recovery from a third quarter which was the weakest since 2014.
Since its launch in 2009, the survey has never exceeded the 50 mark that would indicate an improved financial situation.
Markit said the survey's improvement this month reflected households' increased optimism about the economic outlook for the next year, as well as an increased willingness to spend on cars, holidays and household large goods.
However, despite increased workplace activity and a softening in inflation expectations, households reported a fall in income for the first time since January.
""The gap between rising spending and falling income may have been bridged with increased borrowing,"" the report said. ""Latest data also suggested easier access to unsecured debt.""
A separate survey by the EEF trade association and the bank Santander (MC:SAN), also released on Monday, showed that investment had slowed this year but the proportion of manufacturers planning to invest more over the next two years had risen to 51 percent from 43 percent in 2016.
""With global demand on the up conditions should be ripe for industry to make new investments in capacity and productivity enhancing technology. But Brexit means the future outlook for investment is not clear cut,"" EEF economist Lee Hopley said. 
The Bank of England is hoping solid consumer demand will keep the economy growing in the face of lackluster investment. 
BoE data has shown unsecured household borrowing growing at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent in recent months, down only slightly from an 11-year high reached last year.
Earlier this month, lenders told the BoE they planned to limit access to unsecured credit, after regulators raised concerns about sliding credit standards and urged banks to set aside more capital in case of future losses.
Monday's data is unlikely to dissuade the BoE from raising interest rates soon, after it surprised financial markets last month by saying it expected to raise interest rates in the next few months, if the economy grew as expected.
The Markit report - based on a poll of 1,500 Britons between Oct. 11 and Oct. 15 - showed the public are also revising their expectations for a rate rise. 

Some 40 percent expect rates to rise in the next three months, up from 12 percent in September's survey, while 63 percent see a rate rise within six months.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2017 04:17AM ET</span>","China says jobless rate lowest in years, but challenges persist","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's unemployment rate has hit its lowest point in multiple years at 3.95 percent by the end of September, but employment still face challenges as the economy pushes ahead with structural reforms, China's labor ministry said on Sunday.
The ministry of human resources and social security said in a statement that 10.97 million new jobs had been created in China from January to September this year, a growth of 300,000 compared with the previous year.
The figure represents having essentially fulfilled the ministry's year-end target, the ministry said in a pre-prepared statement given to reporters.
Despite being ahead of schedule, Yin Weimin, head of the ministry, told reporters that ""raising the capacity to employ workers overall still faces large pressures.""
""We need to create 15 million jobs per year,"" Yin said, singling out China's more than 8 million new university graduates that enter the job market each year as one group in need of additional employment.
Yin also said the low unemployment rate in the face of an overall slowdown in the economy was largely due to the new internet economy and entrepreneurship, adding that the ministry would actively support startups to help them ""thrive"".
From 2015 to 2020 every one percent increase in GDP is expected to equal roughly 1.8 million new jobs, Yin said.
Premier Li Keqiang said in March that China added 13.14 million new urban jobs in 2016 and aims to add another 11 million this year while keeping the registered unemployment rate below 4.5 percent.
The labor ministry's announcement was made as part of a once-ever-five-years congress of the ruling Communist Party, which opened last Wednesday and runs until Tuesday.
At the congress, the Party sets broad policy directions and reshuffles top leaders. As China's economy slows, Beijing has made increasing efforts to stave off mass unemployment that may spark social unrest.
China's official unemployment rate has remained generally stable as economic growth has dipped to a 26-year low and the government forges ahead with ambitious plans to cut back on industrial capacity.
Many analysts say, however, that the government figure is an unreliable indicator of national employment conditions as it measures only employment in urban areas and also doesn't take into account the millions of migrant workers that form the bedrock of China's labor force.
On an annual basis, the official unemployment rate was last below 4 percent in 2001, when it was 3.6 percent, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The rate ended 2016 at 4.02 percent after not budging from 4.1 percent from 2010-2015.
The government has said that some sectors, especially those targeted by capacity cuts, such as coal and steel, still show signs of unresolved employment challenges.
The ministry of human resources in April said that China would need to resettle about half a million workers that lose jobs in the coal and steel sectors this year and will speed up development of a ""black list"" system for firms with wage arrears.

Property sales in China dropped for the first time in over two-and-half years in September, while housing starts slowed sharply as cooling measures started to bite, according to Reuters calculations based on official data on Thursday.
Real estate, which directly effects many other business sectors, is a crucial driver for China's economy but also poses significant policy risks as the government tries to tamp down soaring prices while avoiding a crash and an ensuing blow to confidence and economic growth.
Wang Menghui, head of China's housing ministry, told reporters at an briefing in Beijing that ""the national growth rate of transitions for commercial housing will slow in the fourth quarter.""
The rapid rise of property prices has been contained and the government will keep measures consistent and not loosen control, Wang said, adding that the market was healthy and stable.
""We will firmly maintain our position that houses are for living in, not for speculation,"" he said.
The remarks were made as part of a once-every-five-years congress of the ruling Communist Party, which opened on Wednesday and runs until next Tuesday.
At the congress, the party sets broad policy directions and reshuffles top leaders.
China will release September home price data on Monday.
The softening in property activity appeared to drag on broader growth in the third quarter, as many economists had predicted. China's economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, easing from 6.9 percent in the second quarter.
Further slowing is expected in coming months, but the head of the state planning agency said on Saturday that the economy is still on track to meet the official full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent.

The 2017 deficit increased to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. The previous fiscal year deficit was $586 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3.2 percent.
The latest fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, straddled the presidencies of Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Donald Trump, a Republican.
Accounting for calendar adjustments, the 2017 fiscal year deficit was $644 billion compared with $546 billion the prior year. 
Fiscal 2017 revenues increased 1 percent to $3.315 trillion, while spending rose 3 percent to $3.981 trillion.
Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has sought to overhaul the U.S. tax code with precise details currently being worked on in Congress.
The Republican tax plan currently calls for as much as $6 trillion in tax cuts, which would sharply reduce government revenues. 
It has prompted criticism that it favors tax breaks for business and the wealthy and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. The administration contends tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth.
In addition to the annual deficit, the national debt - the accumulation of past deficits and interest due to lenders to the Treasury - now exceeds $20 trillion.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said the ever-rising debt levels are unsustainable as the government pays for the medical and retirement costs of the aging Baby Boomer generation.
For September, the U.S. government recorded an $8 billion surplus, a 76 percent drop from the same month last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury reporting a $6 billion surplus last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the surplus last month was $61 billion compared with an adjusted surplus of $73 billion the prior year.
A senior Treasury official said outlays last month were a record for the month of September. Outlays were $341 billion, up 5 percent from the same month a year earlier while receipts totaled $349 billion, down 2 percent from one year ago.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales unexpectedly rebound in September,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September as the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began to dissipate, but a persistent dearth of properties for sale continued to weigh on overall activity.
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million units last month. August's sales pace was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling 1.0 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units last month. Sales were down 1.5 percent from September 2016, the first year-over-year decline since July 2016.
Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, and Irma, which battered Florida in early September, had already affected sales for August. Texas and Florida make up more than 18 percent of the nation's existing home sales.
The NAR said that Houston's market had recovered quickly, with a 4 percent gain in September compared to a year ago. Florida's sales were still down 22 percent compared to this time last year.
Analysts expect that sales in the hurricane-affected areas will rebound further once delays in sales fade. However, the overall housing sector has been slowing as the number of properties available has not kept up with demand.
Supply was down 6.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has declined on a year-on-year basis for more than two years.
The median house price was $245,100 in September, a 4.2 percent rise from a year ago, reflecting the shortage of homes on the market.
""As long as we have a housing shortage, this will lead to affordability issues,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.5 months a year ago. Economists view a six-month supply as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The median number of days that homes were on the market in September was 34, compared to 39 days a year ago.
Across the regions, sales increased in the West by 3.3 percent and in the Midwest by 1.6 percent. They fell 0.9 percent in the South and were unchanged in the Northeast.

The Commerce Department reported earlier this week that new U.S. single-family home sales fell to a one-year low in September, as Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South.

The industry data showed that home resales increased by 0.7% in September to a seasonally adjusted 5.39 million units from 5.35 million units in the previous month.
The consensus forecast was for a 1.0% decline to 5.30 million units in September.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
“After three straight monthly declines, existing-home sales slightly reversed course in September, but ongoing supply shortages and recent hurricanes muted overall activity and caused sales to fall back on an annual basis,” the report indicated.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that the 1.5% annual decline was the first since 2016.
“Home sales in recent months remain at their lowest level of the year and are unable to break through, despite considerable buyer interest in most parts of the country,” he said.
Yun explained that the decrease was due to stifling sales growth with not enough listings and quickly rising prices that strain the budgets of perspective buyers.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1787 compared to 1.1792 before the release, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.3170, compared to 1.3167 before the data, while USD/JPY traded at 113.42 compared to 113.40 earlier.

A central bank report also showed a sharp jump of nearly 23 percent in property loans in the same period, suggesting authorities will be in no rush to remove tough cooling measures imposed over the past year to rein in soaring home prices.
On Thursday, People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan issued a stark warning about asset bubbles in the world's second-largest economy, which has posted more robust growth this year driven by government spending and record bank lending.
Speaking on the sidelines of a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, one of the most pivotal events in the country, Zhou said China will fend off risks from excessive optimism that could lead to a ""Minsky Moment"", referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices after long periods of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures.
While China's debt has built up rapidly in recent years, much is held by firms under state control.
The government and China bulls argue that its debt levels are generally manageable, given that levels of sovereign and household debt are much lower than in advanced economies, while savings rates are far higher.
The central bank report on Friday, however, suggested consumers are quickly catching up in the debt race, and much of the credit growth appears linked to the property market.
Outstanding household consumer loans in both yuan and foreign currencies totaled 30.2 trillion yuan ($4.56 trillion) by end September, jumping 29.1 percent from a year earlier.
In the first nine months of this year, China's banks issued 5.1 trillion yuan of new household consumer loans.
Analysts suspect funds from some of these consumer loans are flowing illicitly into the property market and stock market. China recently launched probes into consumer loans that are being misused for home purchases, warning they cannot be used to ""fuel property bubbles"".
Despite intensifying property curbs and higher mortgage rates, Chinese banks issued 4.4 trillion yuan ($664.70 billion) of property loans in the first nine months of this year, more than the 4.32 trillion issued in the same period last year. The figures include individual mortgages and loans for property development.
As a result, outstanding yuan-denominated property loans rose 22.8 percent by end-September from a year earlier to 31.1 trillion yuan, the central bank said.
Outstanding individual mortgage loans rose 26.2 percent to 21.1 trillion yuan. The central bank didn't disclose the value of new mortgages issued in the first three quarters.
China will release its latest home price data on Monday. Restrictions on home buying have seen prices level out and even soften slightly in top cities in recent months, but there are signs that speculators are now moving into smaller cities and towns with fewer controls.
Economists say surging house prices will also start to weigh on consumer demand as homeowners divert more of their income to servicing their mortgages.
While China's per capita disposable income rose at the fastest pace in 2 years in the first nine months of this year, spending growth slowed to the weakest on record.

The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was seen likely to rise 0.8 percent in September from a year ago after a 0.7 percent gain the previous month, the poll of 20 economists found.
Tokyo core consumer prices, available a month before the nationwide data, were expected to be up 0.5 percent in October from a year earlier, the same rate of gain as in September.
Economists say electricity and gasoline costs pushed up consumer prices slightly in September but prices excluding energy related items were subdued. 
""Core CPI index is likely to hover below 1 percent supported by energy costs,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But their positive contribution may start to wane and there is a chance the growth in the index may be capped later this year. The focus is how prices of other items will perform,"" he said.
Higher charges for parcel delivery and some food products will be monitored for how they may affect other prices, analysts said.
The government will publish the consumer inflation data at 8:30 Tokyo time on Oct. 27 (2330 GMT Oct. 26).
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said recently that inflation remained weak despite the economy's moderate but steady expansion, which meant the central bank would maintain its massive monetary stimulus for the time being.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>","Slower property, construction growth drag on China Q3 GDP but services pick up","BEIJING (Reuters) - China posted relatively solid economic growth in the third quarter, driven by a stronger services industry, though there were signs of weakness in real estate and construction as property cooling measures start to bite, data showed on Friday.
China's property sector grew 3.9 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, decelerating from 6.2 percent in the second quarter and the slowest pace in nearly two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a more detailed breakdown of third-quarter GDP data issued on Thursday.
Growth in construction activity slowed from 5.4 percent in the second quarter to 4 percent, the weakest expansion since the fourth quarter of 2000, NBS data showed.
Property and construction together account for 13.3 percent of the economy, with property alone directly impacting 40 other industries.
Softening in those sectors appeared to be the main drag on otherwise fairly resilient China data on Thursday. Third-quarter growth eased only slightly to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter, as had been widely expected.
Analysts have long predicted a slowdown in the property sector and construction after city governments began rolling out a flurry of measures from late last year to cool soaring home prices and deter speculators.
Property sales dropped for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years in September and housing starts slowed sharply.
China had posted forecast-beating growth in the first half of the year, led by a sharp turnaround in the long-ailing industrial sector, which accounts for a third of the economy.
A construction boom -- fueled by the housing frenzy and government infrastructure spending -- has spurred demand and prices of building materials, and the resulting return of factory gate inflation has boosted earnings for China's heavily indebted heavy industry.
But industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, and there is uncertainty about how ""smokestack"" industries will fare over the coming months as China implements drastic measures to reduce winter air pollution. 
China's steel output dropped in September from a record high the previous month as mills in the world's top producer cut production in line with Beijing's campaign for clearer skies, pointing to further declines as winter curbs kick in.
The services industry took up much of the slack, expanding 8 percent in the third quarter, from 7.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by a pickup in the financial sector and strong expansion in information technology and other areas.
Though ""old economy"" stalwarts like property and industry have led the way this year, Beijing continues to push for a more balanced economic growth model driven more by consumption and services. 
Consumption industries including retail and catering and accommodation posted mostly stable growth of 7.1 percent in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September.
The labor market outlook was also bolstered by another report on Thursday showing a measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region racing to a record high in October. The signs of labor market strength could cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.
""It doesn't take one hundred PhD economists at the Fed to figure out that the labor market is on the tight side of normal,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""At this point, we would expect a sharp bounce-back in employment growth in October.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.
Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data. The hurricanes, which lashed Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, boosted claims to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September. 
A Labor Department official said claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico continued to be impacted by Irma and Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure. As a result the Labor Department was estimating claims for the islands.
Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey left more than 100,000 restaurant workers temporarily unemployed. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are not included in nonfarm payrolls.
Economists had forecast claims slipping to 240,000 in the latest week. The dollar briefly pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors booked profits after a recent rally that lifted shares to record highs. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
Last week marked the 137th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
Improvements in the labor market have been largely due to a recovery that started during former President Barack Obama's first term. While U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump's tax plans, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies.
The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Tightening labor market conditions likely keep the Fed on track to raise interest in December for a third time this year, even as inflation remains moderate. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 248,250 last week. 
The claims data covered the survey week for October nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 20,500 between the September and October survey periods, supporting views of a rebound in job growth this month.
""The data suggest that the underlying trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region soared 24 points to a record high reading of 30.6 in October.
The average workweek index also increased 8 points to a reading of 19.4. It said no firms reported decreases in employment this month. The robust labor market readings helped to lift the Philadelphia Fed's current manufacturing activity index four points to a five-month high of 27.9 in October, offsetting declines in new orders and shipments measures.
Also underscoring labor market strength, the claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since December 1973. 

The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims fell 22,750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2017 05:35AM ET</span>",UK third-quarter retail sales growth weakest in four years as inflation bites,"By David Milliken and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales slowed unexpectedly sharply in September, dragging quarterly growth to its weakest annual rate since 2013 and suggesting consumer demand remains uncertain as the Bank of England nears its first rate rise in a decade.
Retail sales volumes fell 0.8 percent in September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, reversing a jump in August and undershooting all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll. Third-quarter growth slowed to its lowest year-on-year rate since the second quarter of 2013 at 1.5 percent.
Last month the BoE said it was likely to raise interest rates in the coming months if the economy and inflation pressures strengthen as expected, but in recent days a few investors have begun to doubt if the BoE will move as soon as next month. 
Markets see a roughly 80 percent chance of a rate rise on Nov. 2 after the BoE's next meeting, but sterling fell to a one-week low of $1.3126 after the data on Thursday as rate futures pared back the odds of further rate increases in 2018.
""Uncomfortable questions have been raised about just where UK growth is going to emerge from in Q4,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange services company WorldFirst.
""We will find out in the coming months whether this is consumers holding off on purchases in preparation for Christmas, or whether the Bank of England's messaging on interest rate rises has been enough to keep some hands in pockets.""
BoE policymakers said in September that consumer demand was showing signs of improving after weakness earlier in the year, though it was too soon to tell if it would compensate for weak business investment.
The ONS said Thursday's figures pointed to retail sales adding 0.03 percentage points to economic growth in the third quarter, compared with 0.09 percentage points in Q2. The BoE and most economists expect economic growth of around 0.3 percent.
LESS FOR THEIR MONEY
The rising cost of goods in stores - which are now increasing at their fastest since March 2012 - meant the amount British shoppers were getting for their money was growing more slowly than the amount they spent, the ONS said.
""The slump in retail sales in September was driven by retailers implementing large price rises,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said. 
However, he and other economists cautioned against drawing too strong conclusions about the overall health of consumer demand from trends in retail sales.
Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes in September alone were up 1.2 percent versus the average forecast in a Reuters poll of a 2.1 percent rise.
Consumer price inflation hit a five-year high of 3.0 percent in September, largely reflecting the fall in the pound pushing up the cost of imports since last year's Brexit vote.
Pay has not kept up. Official data on Wednesday showed that regular pay in the three months to August was 0.4 percent lower in real terms than in 2016 - the sixth consecutive month of falls and the longest such run in almost three years.
Some shoppers are tightening their belts, as industry data on Tuesday showed the market share of Britain's four biggest supermarkets falling in response to growing sales at German discount chains Aldi and Lidl.

Relatively cheap online fashion retailer ASOS (L:ASOS) also revised up growth forecasts on Tuesday, in part due to stronger demand after it froze its prices despite higher import costs following last year's fall in the pound.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2017 05:15AM ET</span>",German DIHK chambers of commerce see economy growing 2.2 percent in 2018,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce raised its growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy to 2.0 percent for this year from its previous estimate of 1.8 percent and sees an even stronger expansion next year.
The German economy is enjoying a consumer-led upswing, helped by record-high employment, moderate inflation and ultra-low borrowing costs. The upturn is boosting tax revenues and the state's budget surplus, which should help Chancellor Angela Merkel seal a tricky coalition agreement in coming months.
""The economy is firing on all cylinders,"" DIHK managing director Martin Wansleben said, adding that the upswing was broadly based on strong domestic demand and solid exports.
The DIHK said it expected growth of 2.2 percent in 2018.
""Investments are kicking in as an additional growth driver,"" Wansleben said.
He urged the next government to lower corporate taxes, increase public investments in infrastructure and pass an immigration law to attract more skilled workers from abroad despite a popular backlash following the refugee crisis.
According to the DIHK's autumn survey, business morale regarding current conditions reached a record-high as 51 percent of firms reported good conditions, 43 percent said things were satisfactory and only 6 percent said things were bad.
The DIHK's survey of 27,000 managers, the biggest of its kind in Germany, found that 25 percent expected conditions to improve further, 64 percent for them to remain stable and only 11 percent expected a deterioration.
Asked about the biggest threats for future growth, most companies pointed to shortages of skilled labor and rising labor costs as the principle risks.
Wansleben said a failure by the European Union and Britain to clinch a Brexit trade agreement in time would not stifle Germany's economic upswing, but it would put a question mark over DIHK's growth forecast for 2018.
""Our projections are based on the assumption that the people in charge are dealing with the matter in a way so that there won't be a crash,"" Wansleben said.

Asked whether a breakdown of talks between Brussels and London had the potential to derail Germany's economic upswing, he said: ""The upswing wouldn't be halted, but this would be a very bad signal, politically.""

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 11:00PM ET</span>","Australia jobs grow at fastest pace since 2008, inflation still lags","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia enjoyed another month of solid jobs growth in September, with the annual pace of gains sprinting ahead to the fastest in almost a decade and nudging the unemployment rate lower.
Data out on Thursday showed the unemployment rate slipped to 5.5 percent, compared with analysts' expectations for a steady 5.6 percent. That was the lowest reading since May, which itself was the lowest since early 2013.
Employment climbed a seasonally adjusted 19,800 in September, again topping forecasts for a 15,000 rise, and marking 12 straight months of gains.
Annual jobs growth zoomed ahead to 3.1 percent from an already rapid 2.7 percent. Such a pace would be equivalent to an annual rise of 4.5 million in U.S. payrolls.
That took jobs gains for the year so far to 371,500, led largely by strength in the healthcare, construction and education sectors.
The composition of the data was promising too. While more part-time work was created in September, about 85 percent of jobs added in the past year have been full-time positions.
""Annual growth in full-time jobs was 3.9 percent, which is extraordinary,"" said Michael Workman, a senior economist at CBA.
""Yet, a lot of the increase is in areas such as healthcare and tourism, which are at the lower end of the wage scale,"" he added. ""That means the total income effect of all these jobs is less than in past booms, and it is a lot more benign for inflation.""
At the same time, the workforce participation rate is also the highest since 2012 at 65.2 percent, meaning the proportion of people actively looking for work has expanded too.
That slack in the labor market is keeping wages growth near record lows and restraining inflation, which is stuck under the central bank's target band of 2-3 percent.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has held rates at 1.50 percent for more than a year as it balances soft domestic demand and inflation against escalating household debt.
The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> briefly popped up a fifth of a U.S. cent to $0.7864 on jobs data that led investors to further push out the timing of any increase in interest rates. Interbank futures <0#YIB:> are not fully priced for a rate hike until November next year.
Economists expect hiring to remain elevated in the coming months, led by massive infrastructure spending by the government, public expenditure on healthcare and generally upbeat business surveys.
""However, the abundance of spare capacity already in the labor market means that even if jobs growth remains strong there will be plenty of slack for some time yet,"" said Kate Hicki, Sydney-based economist at Capital Economics.

""This explains why we expect wage growth to remain around 2 percent throughout the next year despite recent improvements in the jobs market.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth slowed in September for the first time in three months, official data on Thursday showed, in a sign overseas demand for goods from the world's third-largest economy may be taking a breather.
The 14.1 percent year-on-year increase in exports was less than the median estimate for a 14.9 percent increase and was less than an 18.1 percent rise in August, which was the fastest expansion in almost four years.
Economists expect Japan's exports to start growing at a faster pace as demand for goods picks up heading into the year-end shopping season and as a weak yen increases export competitiveness, which should support economic growth.
""This slowdown in export growth is temporary,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center Co.
""Data measuring manufacturing activity in overseas economies shows we are in the middle of an expansionary phase. Exports will continue to support Japan's economy.""
Exports slowed in September due to weaker growth in shipments of cars, semiconductors, and electronic parts, data from the finance ministry showed.
Exports were also hit by a decline in shipments of TVs, audio equipment, and ships, the data showed.
However, other data from other Asian economies shows demand for electronics remains strong.
Asia's technology-producing economies have gained a big boost this year from improved global demand for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.
South Korea and Taiwan, posted stronger-than-expected shipments in September, boosted by continued strong global demand for memory and processing chips. China's export growth also picked up in the month.
In volume terms, Japan's exports rose 4.8 percent in September from a year ago, following a 10.4 percent annual increase in August.
Exports to the United States rose 11.1 percent in September from a year earlier due to an increase in shipments of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and pharmaceuticals. This compares with a 21.8 percent annual increase in the previous month.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 5.1 percent in September from a year ago to 616.6 billion yen ($5.46 billion).
The United States is calling for Japan to enter bilateral trade negotiations to lower its trade deficit, so Japan's surplus with the United States could become a source of friction.
China-bound exports rose 29.3 percent year-on-year in September, faster than a 25.8 percent annual increase in August, as Japan shipped more electronics.
Imports rose 12.0 percent in the year to September, versus the median estimate for a 15.0 percent annual increase.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 670.2 billion yen, versus the median estimate for a 559.8 billion yen surplus.
Other recent data pointed to a pick-up in capital expenditure and a tentative turnaround in consumer spending, which suggests that Japan's growth streak will continue due to domestic and external demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace in September through early October despite the impact of hurricanes on some regions, the Federal Reserve said in its latest snapshot of the U.S. economy released on Wednesday, but there were still few signs of an acceleration in inflation.
""Despite widespread labor tightness, the majority of districts reported only modest to moderate wage pressures,"" the U.S. central bank said in its Beige Book report of the economy, derived from talking to business contacts across the country.
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit during the survey period and will have a negative effect on third-quarter economic growth, the Fed has said, although it expects the impact to be temporary.
In the report, three of the Fed's 12 districts - Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas - reported major disruptions from the hurricanes. Most contacts in the Dallas Fed region, which includes hard-hit Houston, said they did not expect significant long-term disruption.
Elsewhere, the report once again highlighted the Fed's major concern - a lack of evidence of rising inflation despite many districts reporting difficulty finding qualified workers.
Shortages were particularly acute in construction, transportation, skilled manufacturing, and some healthcare and service positions. ""These shortages were also restraining business growth,"" the Fed said.
However, this did not feed through into higher wages and there also was little change overall in selling prices despite several districts reporting increased manufacturing input costs. ""Price pressures remained modest,"" the Fed said.
The Fed has grown increasingly accustomed to hearing reports of strong economic growth and hiring but few accompanying broad-based price pressures, and has recently raised the possibility that inflation could be mired at low levels for reasons policymakers do not fully understand.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has retreated further from its 2 percent target rate for much of the year and currently stands at 1.3 percent.
However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen has also said she still expects inflation to rebound and the central bank appears on course to raise interest rates again in December.

"
1374,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 02:07PM ET</span>","Fed Sees Uptick in Economic Growth, but Inflation Remains Modest","Investing.com – Economic growth in recent weeks expanded at modest to moderate rate across the U.S. central bank’s regional districts, as wage growth and inflation remained sluggish, a Federal Reserve survey showed.
The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through October 6, showed continued weakness in wage growth while price pressures remained moderate, dampening expectations that a tight labor market would spur a rebound in inflation.
“Labor markets were widely described as tight,” according to the report, released Wednesday in Washington. “Despite widespread labor tightness, the majority of Districts reported only modest to moderate wage pressures”.
The most recent reading of the Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – retreated to 1.3% in September year-on-year. That is well below the Fed's 2% inflation target.
The continued slowdown in inflation has failed, however, to deter policymakers’ tightening stance on monetary policy as Fed chair Janet Yellen recently reaffirmed the Fed’s commitment to raising rates.
""The U.S economy remains strong and the strength of the labor market calls for continued gradual increases in interest rates,"" Yellen said earlier in the week.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, 91.2% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in December.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 11:48AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts hit one-year low; building permits tumble,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.
""Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,"" said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best."" 
Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts. 
Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation's homebuilding.
Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.
""September's drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units. 
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), fell 0.4 percent.
The dollar (DXY) rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.
LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.
Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.
Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.
Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.
Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.
Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.
Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West. 
Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.
Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly. 
Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.
""We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,"" said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 07:31AM ET</span>","UK pay lags inflation again, BoE still seen raising rates","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British pay growth has lagged behind inflation again, official data showed on Wednesday, adding to questions about how quickly the Bank of England will raise interest rates after an initial hike expected on Nov. 2. 
The British central bank looks on course to deliver its first increase in borrowing costs in a decade, most economists said after the data, reversing last year's rate cut that followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Britain's jobless rate between June and August held at a 42-year low of 4.3 percent, one reason why the BoE thinks pay is likely to pick up soon.
And while overall annual pay growth of 2.2 percent was weaker than inflation - which hit 3 percent in September, its highest level since 2012 - it was slightly above a median forecast of 2.1 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
There was slightly stronger growth for workers in the private sector, the Office for National Statistics said.
""I can't see anything in these numbers that will alter the Bank of England's thinking,"" Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, said.
However, the stubborn gap between weak wage growth and high inflation meant there was ""considerable doubt"" about further rate hikes in 2018, he said.
Britain, like the United States and other rich economies, has seen a sharp fall in unemployment which would normally fuel inflation, according to established economic theory. But wages on both sides of the Atlantic have failed to rise in a significant way since the financial crisis a decade ago.
WEAK GROWTH
Despite a slowdown in Britain's economy this year which has been linked to last year's Brexit vote shock, the BoE is widely expected to return rates to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent on Nov. 2, at the end of its next meeting.
Sterling rose briefly after Wednesday's figures and government bond prices fell slightly before reverting to earlier levels.
The BoE expects pay growth to pick up speed soon because the unemployment rate is below the 4.5 percent level it sees as a trigger for inflation pressure in the economy. It also thinks Brexit will increase price growth in Britain.
However, comments by two BoE policymakers on Tuesday, who noted the weak growth in wages, were seen by investors as a sign of disagreement at the central bank on rate hikes after an initial increase.
The ONS said pay excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1 percent, also a touch stronger than the Reuters poll forecast of 2.0 percent.
In August alone, total wages picked up speed to grow by 2.2 percent after a slowdown in July to 1.7 percent.
The BoE expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up to 3 percent in 2018 and 3.25 percent in 2019.
The number of people in work rose by 94,000 in the three months to August, about half the increase in the three months to July but still a relatively strong rate of growth.
The steady loss of spending power for households is not just a headache for the BoE. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised help for households and has proposed a cap on power tariffs.

Finance minister Philip Hammond is under pressure to come up with further measures when he announces his budget plan in November. But he has little margin for error given the still weak state of Britain's public finances.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment held as expected at 4.3% in August.
The claimant count increased by a seasonally adjusted 1,700 in September, worse than expectations for a gain of 1,000 people and following a decline of 200 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 2,800.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.2% in the three months to September, beating forecasts for a 2.1% rise.
August’s reading was revised to a gain of 2.2% from the prior 2.1% increase.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.1% in the three months to August, compared to expectations for a 2.0% gain and after the prior month’s 2.2% increase which was revised from an initial 2.1% advance.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2017 12:55PM ET</span>",U.S. industrial output rises slightly as hurricanes impact lingers,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production rebounded modestly in September as the lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hobbled activity at factories, but the outlook for the industrial sector remains bullish amid a strengthening global economy and weakening dollar.
The soft industrial production data was offset by another report on Tuesday showing import prices posting their biggest gain in 15 months in September, and steadily rising underlying imported inflation. 
The Federal Reserve said industrial production increased 0.3 percent last month after a 0.7 percent drop in August that was smaller than initially reported. The U.S. central bank said the ""continued effects of Hurricane Harvey and, to a lesser degree, the effects of Hurricane Irma combined to hold down the growth in total production in September by a quarter percentage point."" 
""We will likely see solid growth in the industrial production data in the fourth quarter as production bounces back following the storm-related disruptions,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Last month's rise was in line with economists' expectations. Industrial production was previously reported to have declined 0.9 percent in August. The Fed also revised data for July to show industrial output slipping 0.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent increase. 
Industrial output fell at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the third quarter. Excluding the effects of the hurricanes, industrial production would have increased at an annual rate of at least 0.5 percent, the Fed said.
Manufacturing output edged up 0.1 percent in September after dropping 0.2 percent August. Manufacturing production was restrained by a 2.6 percent plunge in the production of non-durable chemical products, which was likely related to Harvey.
Motor vehicle and parts production nudged up 0.1 percent last month. Manufacturing output declined at a 2.2 percent rate in the third quarter. 
Despite the hurricane-related setback, manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, remains on solid ground amid a weakening dollar, firming global economy and inventory accumulation by businesses. 
Factory sentiment is also at multi-year highs. In September, mining production rose 0.4 percent, reflecting gains in oil and gas extraction. Utilities production rose 1.5 percent last month. With output tepid last month, industrial capacity use rose 0.2 percentage point to 76.0 percent, and is 3.9 percentage points below its long-run average.
EXCESS SLACK
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary. 
""This excess slack could be an impediment to the Fed's elusive 2.0 percent inflation target,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies as investors focused on the Labor Department report showing a 0.7 percent jump in import prices in September. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell marginally, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. 
Last month's increase in import prices was the biggest since June 2016 and followed a 0.6 percent rise in August. In the 12 months through September, import prices climbed 2.7 percent after advancing 2.1 percent in August. 
Last month, prices for imported petroleum increased 4.5 percent after rising 5.0 percent in August. Food prices surged 1.8 percent, the largest gain since July 2016, after edging up 0.2 percent in August. 
Import prices excluding petroleum rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in August, likely as some of the effects of the dollar's more than 6 percent depreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year start to filter through.
Import prices excluding petroleum increased 1.2 percent in the 12 months through September. 
""There is a hint in this report that the weakening in the dollar over the last year is beginning to feed into underlying prices,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The decline in the dollar picked up pace from May to September and we think this will show through into core import prices.""

The cost of imported goods from China was unchanged in September after slipping 0.1 percent in August. Prices for imports from China fell 0.7 percent on a year-on-year basis, the smallest year-on-year decline since April 2015.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2017 07:34AM ET</span>",German investor morale buoyed by flush order books,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Flush order books and solid output figures boosted morale among German investors in October, the ZEW research institute said on Tuesday, suggesting a strong phase of growth in Europe's biggest economy has further to run.
The Mannheim-based institute's monthly economic sentiment index rose to 17.6 from 17.0 in September. While that missed analysts' expectations, the ZEW said the fact that inflation had risen and was expected to rise further was a positive signal.
""(This)... equally points towards a positive economic development in Germany,"" said ZEW President Achim Wambach.
Rising price pressures also made a change in the European Central Bank's ultra-loose monetary policy more likely, he said.
The ECB is due to decide in October whether to extend its stimulus program into next year. Sources have told Reuters it was likely to extend the purchases but reduce their size. 
But its President Mario Draghi cautioned on Friday that the euro zone continued to need substantial monetary stimulus as inflation had not yet risen sufficiently.
Thomas Gitzel, chief economist of VP Bank Group, said the ZEW data suggested that well-filled industrial order books were underpinning ever more broad-based German growth.
The economy should expand by more than 2 percent this year, he said. ""Assuming there is no external shock, the current economic cycle still has time to run.""
Last week the Economy Ministry said it expected the German economy to grow by 2 percent, helped by robust consumption, while trade is not expected to contribute to growth.
Nonetheless, the latest available data showed shipments abroad -- which have traditionally propelled the German economy -- surging in August and ZEW's Wambach said the conditions for exports had improved due to stronger growth in Europe.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the sentiment indicator to come in at 20.0. Another gauge, measuring investors' assessment of current economic conditions, also undershot expectations, edging down to 87.0 from 87.9. Analysts had expected a reading of 89.0.
But Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said the ZEW survey was still encouraging in context despite the undershoot.

""It is encouraging that a majority of investors still expect conditions to improve despite the stronger likelihood that the ECB will taper its asset purchases next year,"" she said.

ELSTAT's estimate, based on seasonally unadjusted data, showed the economy performed worse than the country's official creditors were expecting based on their forecasts, driven by lower than previously estimated household consumption.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",China factories grapple with soaring prices as pollution crackdown bites,"By James Pomfret and Venus Wu
GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Chinese exporters at the country's biggest trade fair are more optimistic about global demand now than six months ago but Beijing's crackdown on pollution is ramping up costs and product prices, hurting smaller factories and foreign buyers.
At the Canton Fair where some 25,000 manufacturers are showcasing products from industrial engines to egg-cracking machines, the mood is sanguine. The world's second-largest economy has defied expectations for a slowdown this year and import and export growth in September suggests factory activity remains in high gear.
In a survey of 102 exporters at the Guangzhou-based trade fair, 77 percent of the mostly small- to medium-sized Chinese manufacturers expect orders to increase next year, compared with 70 percent during the previous event in April.
But many manufacturers, especially smaller ones, complained about currency fluctuations and China's stepped up anti-pollution drive pushing costs up as firms scramble to invest in new equipment or costly processes to meet more stringent emissions standards.
""The environmental regulations are hitting everyone. I'd say thirty percent of factories are affected,"" said Lynn Chen, a director of Masda, a Pearl River Delta manufacturer of antennas with around 20 million yuan ($3 million) in sales annually.
Larger factories were weathering the anti-pollution blitz better but many small factories were being forced out of business including small aluminum tube makers in eastern Zhejiang province, Chen said, noting that the costs of sourcing such components for antennas had risen 20 percent. 
Price rallies across the commodities complex have accelerated in recent months as the government has ramped up environmental inspections and factories prepare for the most stringent ever smog-busting measures across the north this winter. Some 28 cities have been ordered to slash output of heavy industry from aluminum and steel to cement for four months from Nov. 15.
PRICE OF CLEAN AIR
David Li of Guangzhou Light Holdings that makes karaoke speakers with pulsing disco lights said plants with metal plating, dyeing, or spray painting processes had been badly hit, raising production costs by 5 to 10 percent.
A virtual ban on waste paper imports on environmental grounds, was also creating a shortage of generic cardboard packaging, driving paper prices up more than 60 percent in some cases, four exporters said.
""The changes are good, but they're being pushed through too fast,"" said Li.
Of the 102 exporters polled by Reuters, production cost was the biggest concern. 
While online sourcing has partially supplanted marquee trade events such as the Canton Fair, which began in 1957, the event continues to draw tens of thousands of Chinese factories and foreign buyers, making it a useful barometer of China trade.
Some foreign businessmen said they were shocked by the jump in prices for some products. 
""It's really scary. How could the price change so much?"" said Lagos-based Maxwell Akabuogu who has cut the number of containers he sends monthly to Nigeria from 12 to 3, with prices of lead batteries, his staple product, having surged 30 percent over the past four months.
""I'm starting to buy from South Korea now. It's more reliable and the price is steady,"" he said.
Venee Wen, a regional sales manager for the Guangzhou Tiger Head Battery Group, that makes the popular ""555"" brand, said lead battery prices had jumped 20 to 30 percent since April given a surge in costs for the base metal. 
""China's long-term policies on the environment are good but there is a short-term impact ... the bad (polluting) companies have died,"" she told Reuters. ""The buyers will have to get used to these prices. They won't go back to the previous levels.""
During the summer, zinc  and lead  prices in Shanghai rallied with scores of local mines shutting down for long stints during anti-pollution inspections. Winter production curbs have also stoked record buying of raw materials from abroad. 
CURRENCY PAIN
Forty-four percent of firms surveyed said the yuan's 5 percent rise against the dollar this year had hurt their business ""significantly"", while nearly 50 percent said it was hurting them ""slightly"".
Forty-three percent see a further appreciation of the yuan by 2-5 percent in the coming 12 months. 
Concerns about a trade war between China and the United States under President Donald Trump have also eased, with 30 percent seeing such a possibility in the current poll, compared with 40 percent in April.
""Trump is a businessman,"" said Liu Linxia, a LED TV maker. ""He'll make some noise, but not fight.""
Many shrugged off geo-political tensions in North Korea escalating into a possible conflict, with only one in five exporters polled concerned about this risk.

Consumer prices last month were 3.0 percent higher than a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday, matching economists' average expectation in a Reuters poll and marking the fastest rise since April 2012.
Rising inflation - driven largely by the pound's fall since last year's Brexit vote - has squeezed household incomes this year, causing broader economic growth to slow, as wages have failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
Nonetheless, last month the BoE said it expected to raise interest rates in the coming months, so long as the economy and price pressures continued to strengthen.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will move at its next meeting in November - but most also said it would be a mistake to act now. 
""Food prices and a range of transport costs helped to push up inflation in September. These effects were partly offset by clothing prices that rose less strongly than this time last year,"" said ONS statistician Mike Prestwood.
Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to exceed 3 percent in October, higher than it had forecast just a month before, when it predicted it would take more than three years for inflation to return to its 2 percent target.
Although much of the effect of the pound's decline has already been felt by consumers, some retailers are only now starting to pass on price rises.
On Monday, furniture retailer IKEA Group said it had increased prices in Britain by 3 percent to compensate for the slump in sterling.
The pound has fallen around 12 percent since the referendum against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro (=GBP).
Last week BoE Governor Mark Carney said the central bank expected to raise interest rates in the coming months but he declined to be drawn on whether it would be as soon as next month, or if a series of rises is planned.
Core consumer price inflation - which strips out changes in the typically volatile prices of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - was steady at 2.7 percent, as expected in the Reuters poll.
Annual growth in factory gate prices cooled to 3.3 percent, as expected, compared with 3.4 percent in August.
But prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 8.4 percent year-on-year, the same rate as August's upwardly revised figure and slightly higher than forecast.
The ONS also released figures for house prices in August, which showed an 5.0 percent annual rise across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with a 4.5 percent increase in July. Prices in London alone rose 2.6 percent.

In a report, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 3.0% last month, after increasing 2.9% in August.
That was in line with forecasts and was its highest level since the spring of 2012.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.3% in September, also in line with consensus and compared to the 0.6% gain registered in the previous month.
The ONS indicated that the main contributors to the increase in the rate were rising prices for food and recreational goods, along with transport costs, which fell by less than they did a year ago.
“These upward effects were partially offset by downward contributions from a range of goods and services, in particular clothing prices, which rose by less than they did a year ago,” the ONS said.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.7% last month, holding steady as expected at August’s reading.
The retail price index (RPI) increased by 3.9% in September, unchanged from the previous month’s rise. Analysts had expected inflation to increase to 4.0%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by just 0.1% in September, compared to a 0.7% advance in the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.3% gain.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 4.1% in September, unchanged from the prior month while below forecasts for an increase to 4.2%.
Month-on-month, core RPI increased 0.1% last month, compared to August’s 0.7% rise.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.0% in September, below forecasts for a gain of 5.4% and following a 4.5% increase a month earlier. August’s data was revised from an initial 5.1% rise.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, as policymakers weigh risks stemming from tensions surrounding North Korea and the possible renegotiation of Seoul's trade pact with Washington.
All 20 economists polled by Reuters said they expect the Bank of Korea (BOK) to keep its policy rate  at a record-low 1.25 percent, where it has been since June 2016.
The economists are unanimous in expecting the BOK will hold its interest rate for the rest of this year, while a small majority of 12 see a hike to 1.50 percent during the first half of 2018.
""Although domestic economy is showing stable improvement, tightening policy rates in the face of growing downside risks from the review of the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement would only create uncertainties for the financial market,"" said Kim Ji-na, an economist at IBK Securities in Seoul.
""The first half of next year looks most appropriate for the bank to tighten policy rates,"" Kim said. 
In September, South Korea's exports had double-digit annual growth for the ninth straight month - the longest such streak since December 2011 - thanks to higher memory chip and steel product sales.
Trade Minister Paik Un-gyu said shipment growth could slow in the fourth quarter partly due to ""worsening global commercial relations"", though he did not elaborate. 
Early this month, South Korea indicated it was open to talks on revising its 2012 trade pact with the U.S., after initial hiccups that followed President Donald Trump's threat to terminate the accord unless it was renegotiated.
Trump will be visiting Seoul next month during his first Asia trip. 
Renewed concerns sparked by North Korea's sixth nuclear test in September have not subsided, offering another other reason for the BOK to keep monetary policy unchanged for now.
Foreign investors' bond holdings decreased by a net 3.7 trillion won ($3.27 billion) in September, while South Korea's 10-year bond yields (KR10YT=RR) reached a two-year high of 2.435 percent on Sept. 28.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's exports unexpectedly fell from a year earlier in September, data showed on Tuesday, their first on-year contraction in five months as electronics shipments posted their first decline in almost a year.
Non-oil domestic exports fell 1.1 percent in September on-year, data from the trade agency International Enterprise Singapore showed, the first fall since April's 0.6 percent decline. The September contraction was a stark contrast to analysts' forecasts for a 12.7 percent increase.
""We had already been expecting electronics exports to moderate eventually. It was always going to be very difficult to sustain double-digit electronics growth, both on export and production side. We have always been very cautious on this sector,"" said Nomura economist Brian Tan.
In August, exports grew a revised 16.7 percent from a year earlier.
Electronics exports, a major driver of the city-state's trade in recent months, fell for the first time since October 2016, contracting 7.9 percent in September from a year earlier.
Analysts said it was too early to say whether the data marks a minor blip or a deeper correction in the broader surge in demand for electronics goods.
Singapore and other trade-dependent Asian economies have gained a big boost this year from improved global demand, particularly for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.
Asia's other tech export powerhouses, South Korea and Taiwan, posted stronger-than-expected shipments in September, boosted by continued strong global demand for memory and processing chips. China's export growth also picked up in the month.
Stronger global trade in general this year has also benefited Singapore, which boasts one of the world's largest container ports and a global air cargo hub.
However, ING economist Prakash Sakpal said in a research note the weak September exports raise the prospects of a downward revision in third quarter GDP growth.
On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports in September fell 11.0 percent after a 4.5 percent rise in August, the sharpest decline since June 2016 when exports fell 13.0 percent.
The Reuters poll had predicted a contraction of 0.1 percent.
In the third quarter, the city-state grew much faster than expected at 6.3 percent from the previous three months on an annualized basis, driven by demand of its tech products.
Analysts say the recovery is too narrow and that growth likely will start to moderate next year.
""Overall, we are expecting GDP growth of 2.8 percent this year, so this is roughly still fitting that picture,"" Tan said, adding that data over the next couple of months is required to understand ""whether this was more permanent or just a one-off"".

Singapore's central bank held monetary policy steady last week, although analysts say its policy statement suggests a cautious view about growth next year.

The RBA held at a record low 1.5% at the meeting.

Sydney – 3 October 2017
Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna

Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary)
Members commenced their discussion by noting that the Australian economy had grown by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, in line with the Bank’s forecast. Growth in consumption and the contribution from net exports had been higher than in the March quarter, partly reflecting the unwinding of temporary factors. Members noted that the effect of the decline in mining investment had mostly passed and, with resource exports increasing, recently the mining sector had been contributing to overall growth. Growth in public demand and non-mining business investment had picked up and private sector investment intentions for 2017/18, as recorded in the June quarter ABS capital expenditure survey, had been revised higher.
There had been a pick-up in household consumption growth in the June quarter despite ongoing weakness in household disposable income growth. Members noted that consumption growth had increased in most states, although it had remained noticeably weaker in Western Australia than in the eastern states, consistent with weaker income growth in that state. Recent strong growth in employment across all the states was expected to support income growth, and therefore consumption growth, in the period ahead.
Both full-time and part-time employment had recorded solid growth in August. Members noted that this growth had been well above that required to absorb increases in the labour force owing to population growth. Since early 2017, employment growth had been above trend, the unemployment rate and other measures of labour underutilisation had declined a little (although the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5.6 per cent in recent months) and labour force participation had increased, particularly for older workers and prime-aged (25–54 year old) females. By industry, employment growth over the preceding year had been strongest in the household services sector, particularly health care and education, and had picked up notably in the construction sector. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including data on job advertisements, vacancies and hiring intentions, continued to point to slightly above-average growth in employment over the remainder of 2017.
Members observed that residential construction appeared to have plateaued, with dwelling investment largely unchanged in the June quarter. The pipeline of work already approved or under way was expected to continue supporting dwelling investment around current levels over the subsequent year or so; the peak of apartment completions was expected to occur during this period. At the current level of dwelling investment, growth of the housing stock was expected to outstrip that of the population, as it had done in the preceding few years.
Established housing market conditions had continued to ease in Sydney and Melbourne, but had been broadly unchanged in other cities. This pattern was evident in revised housing price data released by CoreLogic in September, as well as in auction clearance rates. Housing prices had continued to decline gradually in Perth. Nationwide measures of housing prices had increased by around 9 per cent over the year to September.
Members noted that the national accounts indicated that private non-mining business investment had increased in the June quarter to be almost 10 per cent higher than at the start of 2016, following an upward revision to non-residential construction in the March quarter. Mining investment had declined a little in the June quarter. The outlook for non-mining business investment remained positive; firms’ estimates of future capital spending had increased, non-mining sector profits had picked up over the preceding year and survey measures of capacity utilisation were well above average. Members noted that business conditions, as reported in surveys, had picked up in most states, although they remained subdued in Western Australia.
Public demand had picked up in the June quarter. Public consumption had increased solidly and new public investment had risen very strongly across most states. This recent strength had been supported by a number of large infrastructure projects, especially related to the construction of roads and railways. Given the large pipeline of public infrastructure work that had been announced or was under way, public investment was expected to continue supporting economic activity over the next couple of years. Members noted that some of this work would be undertaken by the private sector on behalf of the public sector. There had been liaison reports that this had led to some increase in private sector investment in machinery and equipment.
Export volumes had rebounded strongly in the June quarter. Members noted that the increase in resource export volumes had been pronounced, driven by the ongoing ramp-up in liquefied natural gas production. The terms of trade had declined in the June quarter, reflecting lower bulk commodity prices. The terms of trade were likely to have been relatively steady in the September quarter, as the recent falls in iron ore prices had occurred late in the quarter. These falls were largely related to weaker-than-expected data on Chinese industrial production and investment and expectations of cuts to Chinese steel production. Bulk commodity prices had been higher than expected over the preceding year. Members noted that some mining companies had used higher prices to pay down debt and that there had been reports of plans to increase capital investment to sustain the output of existing resource projects.
Recent data had pointed to subdued price pressures across the economy in the June quarter. Retail electricity prices were expected to increase significantly in the September quarter and liaison with businesses had suggested that a number of firms, particularly in the retail and manufacturing sectors, were largely absorbing increases in energy costs into margins rather than passing them through to final prices.
Members noted that indicators of global economic conditions had remained consistent with growth continuing around recent rates. Indicators of industrial production had picked up in many of Australia’s trading partners since 2016, which had contributed to a rise in investment growth and investment intentions in many of these economies. Members noted that growth in exports of electronics and conditions in the electronics-manufacturing sector had increased significantly. This had been particularly stimulatory for the high-income Asian economies. Labour markets had continued to tighten in the major advanced economies, but nominal wage growth had remained low. Headline inflation had increased modestly over the previous month, in line with an increase in oil prices, but core inflation had remained subdued and had even declined lately in the United States.
In China, growth in output appeared to have moderated a little in recent months following stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of 2017. Growth in industrial production and fixed asset investment had eased a little in recent months, while growth in consumption had been relatively resilient. Property price inflation in China had continued to moderate, but a range of other indicators of activity in the housing sector had been more resilient than expected.
GDP growth in the major advanced economies had increased over the preceding year, driven by continued strong growth in consumption and, in some cases, investment. Members noted that this had been accompanied by a further tightening in labour markets. In the United States and Japan, unemployment rates had been at multi-decade lows and were below most estimates of full employment. The euro area unemployment rate had declined to its lowest rate in eight years, although there was significant variation across member economies. Nominal wage growth and core inflation had remained low. Inflation in the major advanced economies was expected to increase towards central banks’ targets over the next few years, as the lack of spare capacity started to put upward pressure on wages and prices.
Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that long-term government bond yields had generally increased over the previous month. The increase has been partly in response to higher-than-expected, although still modest, headline inflation data and further announcements by central banks relating to the gradual reduction of monetary policy stimulus. Nevertheless, long-term government bond yields remained at low levels and overall conditions in financial markets remained accommodative, with volatility at a low level.
As had been widely expected, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced at its September meeting that in October it would begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The median of FOMC members’ projections for the federal funds rate continued to point to another policy rate increase in 2017 and further increases in 2018. Market pricing continued to suggest that the federal funds rate was expected to increase more slowly than this.
The Bank of Canada increased its policy rate in September in response to stronger-than-expected economic growth. Market participants were now pricing in two further increases in the first half of 2018. At its September meeting, the Bank of England indicated that some tightening in the policy rate was likely to be appropriate in coming months. Market pricing suggested that two rate increases were expected to occur by mid 2018. The European Central Bank (ECB) said that a decision about the future of its asset purchase program was likely to be made in October. The ECB was widely thought to be considering extending the scheme into 2018, but reducing the pace of asset purchases.
Members observed that, over September, the actual and expected removal of monetary policy stimulus had contributed to the increase in long-term government bond yields across the major markets. One exception was Japan, where the Bank of Japan’s policy of yield curve control remained in place, involving a 0 per cent target for 10-year Japanese government bonds.
Members noted that the yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had increased over September in response to both global financial market developments and stronger-than-expected domestic economic data, although the yield remained low. Yields on Australian 10-year government bonds had risen by more than yields on US Treasuries over preceding months, which was also the case for a number of other sovereign bonds.
Financial conditions remained highly favourable for companies in major markets. Global share prices had risen over 2017, supported by rising corporate earnings and the improved outlook for global growth. Major market corporate bond spreads to sovereign bonds had continued to narrow over 2017, to be at the lowest level in 10 years.
Financial conditions also remained accommodative in emerging markets, with increases in share prices and declines in government bond yields in 2017. Foreign capital had flowed into these markets seeking higher returns in the global environment of low yields.
Members noted that there had been relatively little movement in most exchange rates over September. The Australian dollar had been little changed over September after having appreciated since mid 2017, partly reflecting a lower US dollar. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated a little in September after having appreciated significantly over preceding months.
In Australia, financial conditions for companies remained accommodative, with price-to-earnings ratios above average and corporate bond spreads at a decade low. Members observed that, nevertheless, companies’ demand for external finance had not increased. Net equity raisings had been subdued and corporate bonds outstanding had been little changed over 2017.
Australian housing credit growth had been relatively stable over 2017, with slowing growth in lending to investors offset by slightly higher growth in lending to owner-occupiers. Members noted, however, that growth in lending to investors had stabilised in July and August. There had been little change in Australian banks’ variable lending rates over September, although some banks had lowered interest rates on fixed-rate loans, with the largest declines for fixed-rate interest-only loans to investors.
Financial market pricing continued to indicate that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged during the remainder of 2017, although expectations of a rate rise in 2018 had increased and a 25 basis point rise was fully priced in for the second half of 2018.
Members were briefed on the Bank’s regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.
The strengthening in global economic conditions had reduced some near-term risks to financial stability arising from rare or extreme events. However, low interest rates and low financial market volatility had promoted financial risk-taking, with high and rising asset prices and debt increasing the risk of a disruptive correction. In China, financial risks remained pronounced. The level of corporate debt in China was particularly high for the country’s stage of economic development. The extent to which this borrowing had occurred through opaque and less regulated channels added to the risks. Members noted that Chinese banks’ off-balance sheet activities complicated an assessment of the resilience of the financial system. Globally, banks’ profitability and capital ratios had increased over the preceding year.
Domestically, household balance sheets remained a key area of attention for policymakers. Household indebtedness remained high and had edged higher in an environment of low interest rates and weak income growth. Despite this, members noted that, relative to income, households’ borrowing from banks, net of offset balances, was only slightly higher than it had been a decade earlier. Interest payments relative to income had declined over the previous decade owing to the reduction in interest rates. However, the high level of debt also meant that households were sensitive to any increases in borrowing interest rates. Members also observed that household assets far exceeded debt, with non-housing assets alone being over two times larger than total household debt. The household savings rate was higher than in the early 2000s, although it had declined over the previous few years in the environment of low income growth.
Members discussed the effects of supervisory measures taken by regulators to curtail riskier borrowing for housing. Interest-only lending as a share of new lending had declined substantially following the introduction of a 30 per cent cap for this lending by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) early in 2017. The share of lending at loan-to-valuation ratios exceeding 90 per cent had also declined. Following the introduction of the supervisory measures, borrowing by investors had been growing more slowly, offset by slightly higher growth in borrowing by owner-occupiers.
Members discussed trends in housing demand, supply and prices given the high level of household debt and the importance of housing as collateral in the banking system. A large number of apartments were expected to be completed in 2018 and 2019 in the largest cities, following several years of increasing apartment construction. Members noted that strong population growth had seen demand for inner-city apartments in Melbourne absorb the city’s large increase in supply. Generally, demand for smaller apartments targeted at foreign buyers in the major cities had eased. Prices and rents of inner-city apartments had fallen slightly in Brisbane and also in Perth, where economic conditions were weaker.
Australian banks had continued to tighten their commercial property lending standards and their overall commercial property exposures had declined a little over the preceding year. This had been offset by strong growth in the commercial property exposures of Asian banks in Australia. Unlike previous episodes of strong expansion in lending by foreign banks, this had not seemed to have led to an easing in lending standards by Australian banks. Members noted that banks’ retail property exposures had continued to grow as retail developments were repurposed to be more flexible given the changing composition of retailing.
Members observed that the profits of Australian banks remained at a high level, which was enabling the banks to increase their capital through retained earnings and dividend reinvestment schemes. The banks had substantially increased their capital ratios since the onset of the financial crisis. Consequently, the major banks were already close to meeting APRA’s new target for ‘unquestionably strong’ capital ratios to be applied from 2020 and the smaller banks generally already exceeded the higher capital requirements. The banks had also increased their liquid asset holdings and their Liquidity Coverage Ratios were well above the 100 per cent minimum requirement.
Australian banks’ non-performing loans were a very low share of their assets compared with banks in other advanced economies. Overall, banks’ non-performing loan share had declined over the preceding year, with a fall for business lending more than offsetting a small rise for household loans. Members noted that the increase in non-performing housing loans was most pronounced in Western Australia, where the labour market was weakest and housing prices had fallen. Nevertheless, the share of non-performing loans in Western Australia remained at a low level. Further, most non-performing loans remained well secured across all states.
Members noted that housing loans as a share of banks’ domestic credit had increased markedly over the preceding two decades. APRA intended to publish a discussion paper later in 2017 addressing the concentration of banks’ exposures to housing. Members also noted that APRA had intensified its focus on Australian banks strengthening their risk culture.
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that economic conditions internationally and domestically had been more positive since 2016. Growth in global trade and production had strengthened and the sources of growth had broadened. Unemployment rates in the advanced economies had declined, but the tighter conditions in labour markets had not flowed through to higher growth in wages or broader inflation pressures. Members also noted that asset valuations were generally quite high.
A number of major central banks had either started to reduce the degree of monetary stimulus or were considering doing so. Nevertheless, financial market pricing suggested that policy rates were expected to remain low for some time. Members observed that moves towards higher interest rates in other economies were a welcome development, but did not have mechanical implications for the setting of policy in Australia, where the timing of any changes in interest rates would be dependent, as always, on developments in domestic economic conditions. Members also noted that monetary conditions in other advanced economies had been eased significantly more than in Australia since the onset of the financial crisis.
Domestically, the increase in GDP growth in the June quarter confirmed that some of the weakness in the previous quarter had been temporary and was consistent with expectations that growth would increase gradually over the coming year, supported by the current stance of monetary policy. Members noted that the increase in spending on public infrastructure projects was supporting a brighter outlook for activity in the non-mining sector. At the same time, recent data continued to indicate that the drag on growth from the end of the mining investment boom was nearing completion.
The current and prospective strength in employment growth in Australia was expected to support household spending in the period ahead, although slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt were likely to be constraining influences. Remaining spare capacity meant that wage and price increases had been subdued. Wage growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market diminished, which was in turn expected to contribute to a gradual rise in inflation over time.
The appreciation of the Australian dollar since mid 2017, partly reflecting a lower US dollar, was expected to contribute to ongoing subdued price pressures. A material further appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
The most recent information about conditions in the established housing market suggested that growth in housing prices had eased from the previously brisk pace in some cities, most notably Sydney, and had remained soft in some others. Housing debt had been outpacing the slow growth in household incomes for some time. Recently, growth in credit to investors in housing had eased a little, although overall growth in household credit had been little changed. Members discussed the importance of continuing to assess the various risks in household balance sheets.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 08:30PM ET</span>","New Zealand inflation picks up in third quarter, unlikely to alter cenbank's cautious stance","By Charlotte Greenfield
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's inflation rate jumped in the third quarter to overtake central bank forecasts, but was unlikely to alter the bank's determination to keep rates on hold for years.
The consumer price index (CPI) picked up 0.5 percent in the three months to the end of September, after a flat reading for the previous quarter, Statistics New Zealand data showed on Tuesday.
The CPI grew 1.9 percent on an annual basis, driven by housing and food costs and beating analysts' expectations for a 1.8 percent rise.
The reading was also well above the 1.6 percent predicted in August by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).
The CPI news sent the New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> to a two-week high of $0.7197, up from around $0.7178 before the release. The currency then gave up some of its gains, settling around $0.7185.
However, economists said the RBNZ was unlikely to waver from its determination to keep interest rates at record lows for years while it waited for previously-tepid inflation to stabilize around 2 percent.
""For now, inflation sits comfortably in line with the Reserve Bank's target. However, there is little that suggests a risk of inflation breaking higher, particularly with the New Zealand economy seemingly entering a slower growth phase,"" said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Bank.
New Zealand's previously robust economic growth slowed in recent quarters as skill shortages led to capacity constraints and red-hot house prices cooled.
Added to that was intense uncertainty about the direction of the country's next government after an inconclusive election last month left a small, nationalist party holding the balance of power.
The third quarter gains in price growth were led as usual by housing related costs, with rents rising an annual 2.2 percent. New Zealand's booming population, stoked by record net migration, has created strong demand for housing in the past few years, though house prices themselves have eased this year as central bank restrictions on lending took effect.
Food bills rose 1.1 percent on strong global prices for soft commodities, while new government charges pushed non-tradables inflation, excluding housing, to a three year high of 2.2 percent.
""There are tentative signs that inflation's broadening beyond housing but we’ve been here before that that's petered out,"" said Philip Borkin, economist at ANZ Bank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers rebounded in October to match a peak last seen in mid-2007, a Reuters poll found, further evidence that the economic recovery is gathering momentum helped by a weak yen and strong overseas demand.
The monthly poll followed an Oct. 2 Bank of Japan survey that showed big manufacturers were the most optimistic about the business outlook in a decade.
The survey results are an encouraging sign for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of an Oct. 22 lower house election as he hopes to convince voters his reflationary policies are helping to sustain a private sector-led recovery.
The Reuters Tankan service-sector sentiment index slipped from the previous month's two-year high but remained relatively high.
""Global car sales have been performing well,"" a manager of a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey, in which companies respond anonymously.
An electrical machinery maker said: ""Currency fluctuations have been small and orders have been steady.""
The poll of 548 large- and mid-sized companies was conducted Sept. 28 to Oct. 12, in which 254 firms responded.
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose six points in October to 31, driven by producers of electrical machinery, metal products and other machinery, and oil refiners. The index matched a high last seen in June 2007.
Service-sector sentiment fell to 30 from the previous month's two year-high of 34, dragged down by retailers. That could be a concern for private consumption, which constitutes some 60 percent of the economy.
The manufacturers' and service-sector indexes were expected to fall to 24 and 28 respectively in January, reflecting concerns about North Korea, the outlook for the Chinese and U.S. economies, and Japan's domestic politics.
Business sentiment will be among indicators the BOJ board will scrutinize when it issues fresh long-term economic and price forecasts at a rate review on Oct. 30-31.

BOJ policymakers hope a sustained economic recovery will boost wages and consumer spending, but analysts expect inflation to remain some way off the central bank's 2 percent target.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 12:00PM ET</span>","China third-quarter GDP growth to slow on housing curbs, debt clampdown","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic growth is expected to ease to 6.8 percent in the third quarter from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter due to a cooling property sector and the government's battle against debt risks, a Reuters poll showed.
Analysts' projected slowdown was at odds with central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan's forecast suggesting an upside surprise as the economy could grow 7 percent in the second half of the year, versus 6.9 percent in the first six months.
The poll of 54 analysts, conducted before Zhou's forecast, showed a modest cooling in GDP growth - but within Beijing's comfort zone, as President Xi Jinping is set to strengthen his grip on power at a Communist Party Congress this week.
Zhang Yiping, an economist at Merchants Securities, said Zhou's forecast may have raised upside risks for his prediction of 6.8 percent growth for the third quarter, although he still expected a gradual cooling in the economy.
""The economy is likely to slow steadily given that property investment and infrastructure investment could slow, although the impact from rising borrowing costs on the economy could be limited,"" Zhang said.
Analysts have penciled in a gradual GDP slowdown due to an expected softening in property investment and construction as more cities try to cool surging housing prices, while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs. 
China will release third-quarter GDP on Oct. 19 - a day after the opening of the Party Congress - along with September industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment.
A surprisingly upbeat gross domestic product reading would likely lift stocks and global commodity prices, and boost bullish sentiment on the yuan , which has gained about 5.6 percent against the dollar so far this year. Economists in the poll estimated GDP grew 1.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, unchanged from the second-quarter, though only 18 analysts gave sequential forecasts.
REFORM HOPES
At the opening of the Party Congress, President Xi is likely to shed light on China's long-term economic development plans beyond 2020, amid market hopes that he may deepen economic reforms to help the economy overcome the ""middle income trap"".
Investors are waiting to see if sustained economic growth this year will give China's leaders the confidence to quicken reforms, though many policy insiders believe Beijing will tread cautiously in implementing painful changes due to resistance and worries about the impact on economic stability.
Few specific policy changes are expected from the Party Congress and analysts are looking to the annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is usually held in December, for signals on the 2018 growth target and policy initiatives.
The Chinese authorities are trying to walk a fine line by containing riskier types of financing and slowing an explosive build-up in debt without stunting economic growth.
The PBOC in late September cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves (RRR) for the first time since February 2016. The move, effective in January, offers an earnings boost to banks if they lend more to struggling smaller firms and the private sector.
STEADY SEPT DATA EXPECTED
Analysts expected September industrial growth to accelerate to 6.2 percent from a year earlier, against August's 6 percent, while retail sales growth is seen edging up to 10.2 percent.
Fixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.7 percent in the first three quarters on-year, only slightly softer than a 7.8 percent rise in January-August.
The economy grew 6.9 percent in the second quarter - the same as the first quarter, defying expectations for a slowdown due to firmer exports and a resilient property sector, despite a government pledge to crack down on rising risks.
The economy is on track to hit the government's full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent.
Economic activity showed visible signs of slowing in July and August, as the property sector finally cooled in response to government measures, while lending costs rose - the result of a government crackdown on riskier types of lending.
But some data for September pointed to a slight improvement, with imports and bank lending growing more than expected, while exports picked up.
On Monday, data showed producer prices in September jumped 6.9 percent from a year earlier, confounding views that producer inflation had peaked.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>",Credit card data shows delinquencies rose in September,"By Nikhil Subba
(Reuters) - Credit card delinquency rose for the third straight month in September, data from JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and card issuer Discover Financial Services (N:DFS) suggested on Monday.
The data add to signs that U.S. consumers are struggling amid rising household debt, after bank results last week pointed to an increase in provisions for future losses.
September delinquencies for JPMorgan rose 1.22 percent, while those at Discover Financial were up 1.64 percent from August. Those at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also rose 1.56 percent - the second rise in three months.
Credit quality at several banks appears to be deteriorating as lenders target consumers with worse credit ratings to fuel revenue growth at a time when low interest rates are quashing their returns on other loans.
""Delinquency rates have risen in part because lending to subprime borrowers increased significantly in recent years,"" CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst Matt Schulz said.
""That brings with it a lot of risk, for both the banks and the consumer.""
JPMorgan said last week that provisions for credit losses across the bank rose 14 percent in the third quarter.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) saw a 15 percent rise.
While delinquency rates remain significantly below the levels seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising rates would mean higher loan losses for lenders.
U.S. household debts hit a record high after having earlier in the year surpassed its pre-crisis peak, helped by modest rises in mortgage, auto and credit card debt, where delinquencies jumped.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",Stronger currency shrinks euro zone trade surplus in August,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone's trade surplus shrank in August as the stronger euro fueled an import boom that was only partly offset by a rise in exports, official estimates released on Monday showed.
Although the euro has depreciated against the dollar from a 2017 peak in early September, it is still up more than 12 percent this year. Cheaper imports have complicated European Central Bank's plans to raise inflation in the euro zone.
The European statistics office Eurostat said the 19-country currency bloc's surplus in goods trade dropped to 16.1 billion euros ($18.9 billion) in August from 23.2 billion in July. It was also lower than in August 2016 when it stood at 17.5 billion euros.
The lower surplus was caused by a surge in imports from countries outside the euro zone, which grew 8.6 percent on the year, according to seasonally unadjusted data.
This rise outstripped the 6.8 percent increase in exports, resulting in a smaller surplus for the euro zone. The August surplus was the lowest recorded this year, excluding a temporary deficit in January.
The strong euro, which peaked at nearly 1.20 dollars in August, contributed to the reduced surplus, as it made imports cheaper.
This in turn capped inflation, making it harder for the ECB to tighten monetary policy.
Inflation in the euro zone was 1.5 percent in September, according to Eurostat preliminary estimates, the same rate as in August and below the ECB target of a rate close to 2 percent.
The ECB is expected to extend its stimulus program for nine months at its next meeting on Oct. 26 while scaling back the monthly purchases, sources said.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2017 11:30PM ET</span>",China September producer prices jump most in six months in boost for global inflation,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation unexpectedly accelerated to a six-month high in September as a construction boom shows no signs of abating and a government crackdown on air pollution triggers fears of winter shortages and frenzied jumps in commodity prices.
China's strong demand for building materials has triggered a year-long commodities rally which is helping to buoy manufacturing activity and inflation around the world, even if it has yet to trickle down to the consumer level.
China's economy is expected to grow 7 percent in the second half of this year, the country's central bank governor said, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 6.9 percent in September from a year earlier, from 6.3 percent in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
The gain - the strongest since March - signals continued resilience in China's economy and industrial sector profits, welcome news for Communist Party leaders two days ahead of a twice-a-decade party congress.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected September producer inflation would be steady from August at 6.3 percent.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 1.0 percent in September.
China's commodity futures prices have seesawed wildly in recent weeks as the government embarks on its biggest environmental crackdown yet to reduce the country's notoriously thick winter smog.
Some steel mills, smelters and coal companies have cranked up production ahead of expected official curbs on output or outright shutdowns in coming months. Environmental inspections have disrupted some supply lines and added to uncertainty in the market.
Shanghai steel futures surged nearly 7 percent on Friday, spurring a similar rally in raw materials iron ore and coking coal.
Iron ore and coal prices had tumbled sharply in September on fears of weaker demand for raw materials, but traders are confused as to how the winter supply and demand picture will play out and how much of the impact will ripple through into global commodity markets.
Top steelmaking city Tangshan became the latest to enforce production cuts this month, ahead of the previous deadline of Nov. 15, when winter heating systems in China are switched on.
Bolstered by manufacturing and a hot property market, China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017.
China will have no problem meeting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, and may even beat it, the head of the Statistics Bureau said last Tuesday.
Analysts still predict producer prices will start to soften in the fourth quarter due to a high base of comparison last year and as overall demand moderates along with economic growth.
China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.6 percent as expected in September, versus 1.8 percent in August and well within Beijing's 2017 target of 3 percent.
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index (CPI), fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier.
Non-food price inflation quickened to 2.4 percent in September from 2.3 percent in August.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",Top UK businesses' Brexit worries ease slightly: Deloitte,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Brexit worries of some of Britain's biggest businesses have eased slightly over the past three months and optimism is up from a low struck after June's unexpected election result, a survey by accountants Deloitte showed on Monday.
The poll of chief financial officers who make investment decisions at Britain's biggest companies showed that the proportion who think Brexit will damage the business environment dropped to 60 percent from 72 percent in the previous survey.
The proportion of CFOs who think now is a good time to take on riskier ventures - for example by investing in new projects - has risen to 24 percent, three times higher than just after the June 2016 referendum.
The survey was conducted between Sept. 14 and Oct. 4, meaning most of the responses came prior to a bout of political infighting in the ruling Conservative Party and another inconclusive round of talks on the terms of Britain's divorce from the EU.
However, the survey is still likely to cheer the Bank of England, which is predicting stronger investment growth next year as it prepares to raise interest rates for the first time since 2007 - probably as soon as next month.
The Deloitte poll's headline gauge of business optimism also picked up after slumping following Prime Minister Theresa May's unexpected failure to retain a parliamentary majority in an early election she called for June 2017.
""Despite Brexit uncertainties a broadening global recovery has helped lift sentiment among CFOs,"" said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.
However, the prospect of leaving the EU in March 2019 is still a big concern for businesses.
British finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that a lack of clarity about the direction of travel of Brexit talks was hurting business and consumer sentiment, and that a transition deal was needed by early 2018 at the latest.
While the world economy is going through a strong period at present, British economic growth is lagging behind its peers.
Economic consultants EY ITEM Club forecast in a report also published on Monday that growth will slow to 1.4 percent next year from 1.5 percent this year, well below historic averages of just over 2 percent.
David Sproul, a senior partner at Deloitte, said that Brexit remained firms' top worry despite some easing over the past three months, with almost a third expecting it to curb their investment over the next three years.
""It is critical that progress is achieved soon in the negotiations between the UK and the EU to ... deliver a real boost to corporate spirits and plans,"" he said.

The Deloitte report is based on surveying 102 chief financial officers and group finance directors at Britain's biggest companies, including 20 in the FTSE 100 and 40 in the FTSE 250, and similar privately held or foreign-owned firms.

Consumer prices fell 0.5 percent from a year earlier last month, after a 0.4 percent drop in August that was the first fall since at least early 2015, when the current data series began.
Housing and utility prices sank 4.7 percent from a year ago in September, their biggest drop for at least several years, and fell 0.7 percent from the previous month. In August, prices had slipped 4.0 percent from a year earlier.
Housing prices were already in a downtrend before June, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.
But the sanctions have contributed to the slide by hurting investor sentiment, stifling demand among nationals from other Gulf states, and tightening liquidity in the banking system.

Food and beverage prices rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier in September.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2017 12:56PM ET</span>","Gasoline boosts U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast, but underlying inflation remained muted.
The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose and stocks on Wall Street hit record highs. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Policymakers could, however, find solace in another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.
""The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. The rise was the biggest since January and lifted the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August.
Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in the CPI. The jump in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent gain in August.
The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month's increase in gasoline prices.
Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices ticked up 0.1 percent as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles, furniture and medical care declined. The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August.
In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now advanced by the same margin for five consecutive months.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ""many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.""
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SLIP
Adding to the debate, the University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed consumer's inflation expectations over the medium term slipped in early October.
While the Fed could still increase borrowing costs in December for a third time this year, it would probably be hard for the central bank to push through the three rate hikes it has forecast for 2008, if the slow inflation trend persists.
Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.
There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.
Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month's increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
The pick-up in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. The growth outlook was boosted by another report from the Commerce Department showing inventories recorded their biggest gain in nine months in August.
Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.
The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period. The Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace after the data.

""The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories increased 0.7 percent after rising 0.3 percent in July. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories gained 0.7 percent in August as estimated last month. Retail inventories were unchanged in July.
Motor vehicle inventories rose 1.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent jump. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent as reported last month.
They slipped 0.1 percent in July. August's gain suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP in the third quarter after adding just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the 3.1 percent annualized pace of growth in the April-June period.
Inventory investment, business spending on equipment and trade are seen cushioning the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on third-quarter GDP. The storms are expected to chop off at least six-tenths of a percentage point from economic growth in the July-September period.
Business sales increased 0.7 percent in August, the largest gain since last December, after rising 0.3 percent in August. At August's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from July.

Consumers do not expect an economic downturn anytime soon, with a positive outlook for consumer spending that would mark the second longest expansion since the mid 1800s, said University of Michigan Chief Economist Richard Curtin.
""While the early October surge indicates greater optimism about the future course of the economy, it also reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected,"" he said.
Despite the optimism, consumers seem to have accepted slower growth to living conditions, as they anticipate low unemployment, low inflation and modest income gains, Curtin added.

Exports were seen up 14.9 percent in September from a year ago, following a 18.1 percent jump in August, the fastest pace of increase in nearly four years, the poll of 18 economists showed.
Imports are forecast to have risen an annual 15.0 percent, climbing for nine months in a row, the poll found.
As a result, Japan likely posted trade surplus of 559.8 billion yen ($4.99 billion) in September, which would be the fourth straight month in the black.
Japan's export sector has been supported by a surge in demand for the country's cars and electronic devices, particularly semiconductors and electronic displays.
""Exports continue to be upbeat, notably shipments to Asia and the United States,"" said Akihiro Morishige, senior economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
""Export growth of capital goods such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment is remarkable because the global demand for semiconductors is on the rise.""
Positive data could help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of an Oct. 22 election as he tries to convince voters that his ""Abenomics"", a policy mix of ultra-lose monetary policy and huge fiscal spending, helped improve the economy.
The finance ministry will release the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday). 
Japan and the United State will hold the second round of an economic dialogue on Oct. 16 in Washington.
At the talks, Tokyo is expected to propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen U.S. beef imports, which has been a point of U.S. criticism in its trade dialogue with Japan. 
If successful, the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the United States, which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shows little sign of breaking out of its lethargy and it is ""extraordinary"" that the Bank of England is considering raising interest rates, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Friday.
The BCC's Quarterly Economic Survey of businesses, the largest of its kind, said sales at services firms that make up the bulk of the economy were steady in the third quarter. 
But there was little sign of a pick-up in pay pressures or investment, both of which the BoE expects to rise markedly next year.
Overall the BCC described the survey as ""uninspiring"", with political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and Brexit clearly affecting British businesses.
Despite confounding forecasts that the 2016 vote to leave the European Union would lead to a sudden slowdown, Britain's economy has struggled this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012.
The BCC said price pressures in companies, while high historically, looked likely to peak soon. 
""Against this backdrop, it seems extraordinary that the Bank of England are considering raising interest rates,"" said Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics.
In September the BoE said interest rates would probably rise ""in the coming months"" if the economy continued to grow and price pressures kept building. 
A majority of economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will make its move at its next meeting in November - but most also said it would be a mistake to act now. [BOE/INT]
""We'd caution against an earlier than required tightening in monetary policy, which could hit both business and consumer confidence and weaken overall UK growth,"" Thiru said.
Manufacturers enjoyed a better quarter, with domestic and export sales improving slightly, the BCC said. 
While gauges of confidence in turnover and profitability stood at their highest levels since 2015, the BCC survey showed little desire among manufacturers to increase investment.
A slightly larger proportion of manufacturers said they expected to raise prices, but this was mostly down to the cost of raw materials rather than pressure from pay settlements.
In the services sector, a net 15 percent of firms reported that pay was putting pressure on prices - up just a percentage point from the five-year low struck in the second quarter.

Other surveys, including one from the BoE's regional advisers, have pointed to similar weakness in corporate pay intentions.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2017 09:12AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices increase; weekly jobless claims fall,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in September as the price of gasoline recorded its biggest increase in more than two years amid hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in Texas.
Other data on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than one-month low last week as the boost to claims in Texas and Florida from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to unwind. 
While the storms impacted the data, there were signs of underlying strength in both wholesale inflation and the labor market, potentially leaving the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December.
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. Wholesale prices were also lifted by an increase in the cost of services. In the 12 months through September, the PPI jumped 2.6 percent. That was the biggest gain since February 2012 and followed a 2.4 percent jump in August.
Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September after increasing 9.5 percent in August. The increase was the largest since May 2015 and accounted for two-thirds of the 0.7 percent rise in the price of goods. The Labor Department said higher energy prices were likely the result of ""reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area due to Hurricane Harvey.""
It said Harvey and Irma, which devastated Florida, had ""virtually"" no impact on the collection of PPI data or survey response rates. Harvey and Irma, which struck in late August and early September, caused the economy to shed jobs last month for the first time in seven years. 
The storms have also restrained consumer spending and undercut industrial production, homebuilding and home sales.
Last month's gasoline-driven surge in the PPI, however, is likely to be temporary amid ample crude oil supplies.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains while U.S. stock index futures were trading lower.
CORE INFLATION FIRMING
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar increase in August. The so-called core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9 percent in August.
Inflation has remained relatively low, with the main measure tracked by the Fed retreating further below its 2 percent target in August. 
Price pressures remain benign despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed a vigorous debate among policymakers over inflation, with ""several"" expressing concern that ""the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent.""
Despite tepid inflation, U.S. financial markets have largely priced in a rate increase for December. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
Last month, the cost of services increased 0.4 percent, driven by a rise in margins for final demand trade services, a measurement of changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services edged up 0.1 percent in August.
The cost of healthcare services was unchanged after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. 
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since late August. 
Claims have been declining since surging to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September as workers displaced by the hurricanes were left temporarily unemployed.
Underscoring the labor market's underlying strength, claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 136 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Sept. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.

Morale among small businesses is weaker than a year ago, although stronger than shortly after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority in June, according to the survey from retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) UK and business promotion company Enterprise Nation.
Businesses have been hit by higher raw materials costs due to the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit, and the survey showed firms expect a continued squeeze on revenue over the next year.
However, 73 percent of firms have not delayed business decisions as a result of the Brexit vote. Of those that have, hiring was the main area affected.
Some 42 percent of small businesses surveyed wanted Britain to stay in the European Union, but most want to leave - albeit with little agreement on terms.
Just over a quarter of firms wanted a Canadian-style trade deal with the EU, 13 percent want ties like Switzerland's, while smaller proportions wanted to be part of the European Economic Area trade bloc, a customs union or have no trade deal at all.
Finance minister Philip Hammond told lawmakers on Wednesday that uncertainty about the shape of Britain's future deal with the EU was harming investment and consumer confidence.

Overall output rose 1.4 percent in August month-on-month and by 3.8 percent year-on-year, the European Union statistics office Eurostat said.
The figures were well ahead of the average forecast of economists polled by Reuters for a 0.5 percent month-on-month increase and a 2.6 percent year-on-year rise. The monthly rate was the highest rise since November 2016.
There was also an upward revision of the July data, to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent in the month and to 3.6 percent year-on-year from the 3.2 percent initially estimated.
The output figures bode well for the 19-country bloc's growth in the second half of the year, as the increase in capital goods production, of 3.1 percent in the month, showed businesses were investing.
Production of durable consumer goods, such as cars, was also strong, rising by 1.3 percent in the month, showing industry was expecting increased consumer demand for more expensive goods.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2017 11:30PM ET</span>","Japan's wholesale prices rise at fastest in nine years, bank lending up","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices rose in September at the fastest annual pace in almost nine years due to rising prices for gasoline, metals, and agricultural products, but the gains won't necessarily boost the country's notoriously weak inflation.
Economists expect consumer prices to rise only gradually because many Japanese companies prefer to absorb higher input costs rather than increasing prices, making it difficult for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to reach its 2 percent inflation target.
""Prices are rising upstream, but companies are very reluctant to raise retail prices,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""If anything, I am worried about corporate profit margins. It is difficult for consumer prices to accelerate when companies do not pass on higher costs.""
Wholesale prices rose 3.0 percent in September from a year earlier, increasing for the ninth straight month, BOJ data showed on Thursday.
September's gains marked the fastest wholesale price growth since October 2008, excluding the effect of a nationwide sales tax hike in 2014. (The BOJ said the sales tax applies not only to consumers but also to many transactions between companies.)
The rise in the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price that firms charge each other for their goods and services, matched the median economists' estimate and followed a 2.9 percent annual increase in August.
The BOJ has had to push back the timing for reaching its price target six times since it deployed its massive stimulus program in 2013.
It now hopes consumer inflation will hit its target by March 2020, as signs of strength in the economy and a tight job market boost wages and give households more purchasing power.
Nationwide core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent year-on-year in August, which was faster than July but still well below the 2 percent inflation the BOJ hopes to achieve.
The BOJ next meets on Oct. 30-31, where it will update is consumer price forecasts. There is a chance that one policymaker could formally propose more monetary stimulus after a summary of opinions from the previous meeting showed one member said stronger measures were needed.
Such a proposal is unlikely to win over a majority of the BOJ's nine board members, but it could spur more public debate about whether the BOJ's policies still make sense after it has repeatedly revised the length of time needed to reach its price target.
Japanese bank lending rose 3.0 percent in September from a year earlier, separate data showed. This was a slight slowdown from a 3.2 percent annual increase in August but still indicated healthy credit growth.

Investor expectations for a December interest rate hike grew after the Federal Reserve's September minutes showed Fed members agreed that gradual monetary policy tightening was warranted.
“… nearly all [FOMC members] supported again indicating in the postmeeting statement that a gradual approach to increasing the federal funds rate will likely be warranted,” the minutes showed.
The details of the meeting, at which the U.S. central bank voted to raise interest rates, also showed Fed members were increasingly concerned that the slowdown in inflation may not as transitory as anticipated.
“… many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,” the Fed said in the minutes. That prompted “a few” officials to suggest that the central bank should hold off further rate increases to assess trends in inflation.
The dollar and treasury yields dipped lower as market participants interpreted the Fed minutes as somewhat dovish amid signs that Fed members are growing increasingly concerned over the slowdown inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose for a second straight month in August, handily beating market expectations, signaling a pickup in capital expenditure that should encourage Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of a general election this month.
The premier hopes to convince voters in the Oct.22 elections that his ""Abenomics"" recipe of aggressive monetary stimulus, fiscal spending and reform plans has improved the economy enough to stoke a sustainable recovery.
Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday that core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.4 percent on-month in August.
That beat the median estimate of a 1.1 percent increase seen in a Reuters poll of economists, following an 8.0 percent gain in July. The value of core orders, which exclude those of ships and utilities' electrical power equipment, stood at 882.4 billion yen ($7.86 billion), the highest since July 2016.
""There are uncertainties such as the outlook for U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy, North Korea, and Japan's political risks, but conditions surrounding capital spending remain basically favorable,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.""Capital expenditure will perform well in the coming one to two years.""
Analysts expect capital expenditure to pick up gradually, backed by refurbishing demand, infrastructure investment for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, and spending on labor-saving equipment, as well as spending encouraged by low borrowing costs enabled by the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy.
""The current level of orders remains consistent with a further increase in capital spending last quarter,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics noted in a report.
""The continued recovery in capital goods shipments excluding transport equipment also suggests that the expansion in investment spending remains intact.""
Orders from manufacturers jumped 16.1 percent month-on-month in August, driven by general-purpose production machinery such as machine tools, while service-sector orders grew 3.1 percent, led by orders for boilers and turbines.
The Cabinet Office raised its assessment of machinery orders from stalling to showing ""signs of pick-up"".
Overseas orders, which are not counted as core orders, grew 11.5 percent in August, due to some big-ticket orders including power generators and aircraft.
The BOJ's closely-watched quarterly tankan survey showed last week that big firms plan to increase capital spending by 7.7 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March 2018, underscoring the view business expenditure is on a firm footing.
A sustained recovery in business expenditure should support the central bank's view that a virtuous circle of private sector-led growth will take hold in the economy.

Still, wage growth and inflation remain stubbornly low despite recent signs of rebounding private consumption, keeping the BOJ under pressure to maintain its massive monetary stimulus.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will raise its 2017 growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy to 2.0 percent, a sharp increase from its earlier estimate of 1.5 percent and the strongest rate since 2011, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.
Berlin also plans to lift its 2018 forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 1.9 percent, up from its earlier forecast of 1.6 percent, the person familiar with the projections said.
Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries will present the government's updated forecasts on Wednesday.
The German economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2016, the strongest rate in five years, propelled by private consumption and state spending as households and authorities are benefiting from record-high employment and ultra-low borrowing costs.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the German economy to a calendar-adjusted 2.0 percent in 2017 and 1.8 percent in 2018.

The government's growth forecast figures are not adjusted for workdays. Due to the unusually strong calendar effect in 2017, the forecast would translate into an adjusted growth rate of 2.3 percent this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Brexit-bound economy remains stuck in a low gear but is probably not weak enough to dissuade the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month, economic data showed.
Separately on Tuesday, Britain's budget forecasters gave a gloomier medium-term outlook for the economy, potentially leaving finance minister Philip Hammond with less room to offset any big hit from Britain's departure from the European Union.
The somewhat downbeat picture for the world's fifth-biggest economy from a raft of data - including a record goods trade deficit - contrasted with the situation in some of Britain's closest trading partners in the European Union.
German exports outpaced imports in August, adding to signs it performed strongly in the third quarter, and Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected.
But there were some signs of encouragement for Britain.
The country's factories had their strongest two months of 2017 in July and August, and the construction sector grew for the first time in three months.
In year-on-year terms, factory output was 2.8 percent higher, its fastest growth in six months.
Revisions to past data showed Britain's economy had been a bit less weak earlier this year than previously thought.
""They're not storming figures but I think they're good enough to keep the Bank of England on track for a November rate hike,"" said Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec.
Britain's economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, and by weak wage growth.
BOE ANNOUNCEMENT
Nonetheless, the BoE said last month that most of its policymakers thought it was likely that they would need to raise rates for the first time in a decade in the coming months.
The BoE believes last year's Brexit vote will create more inflation pressure by dampening business investment and slowing migration to Britain.
Sterling rose after Tuesday's official data and British government bond prices edged down. [GBP/]
Figures for the much bigger services sector are due to be released on Oct. 25, along with a preliminary first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product growth, little more than a week before the BoE's Nov. 2 announcement.
Many economists say only a shock weakening in those figures is likely to cause the BoE to delay raising rates.
In a reminder of the long-standing problems that have held back Britain's economy, Tuesday's data showed the country's deficit in its trade in goods hit an all-time high in cash terms.
That was despite the slump in the value of the pound which some supporters of Brexit have predicted will deliver an export boom. Export volumes in the three months to August were 3.2 percent lower than the previous three months, though they are 8.9 percent higher than a year before.
And there was bad news regarding the Achilles heel of the British economy - the long-standing weak record of its companies and workers to squeeze more output from their work.
Britain's official budget watchdog said it expected to ""significantly"" downgrade its forecasts for productivity growth in the next five years.

Finance minister Hammond is due to present an annual budget on Nov. 22. Although he is under pressure to increase public spending and eliminate a pay cap on public sector pay, any cut in productivity forecasts would substantially limit his room for maneuver by reducing future tax revenues.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German trade activity picked up in August as exports outpaced imports, widening the surplus and adding to evidence that Europe's biggest economy performed strongly in the third quarter.
Seasonally adjusted exports rose by 3.1 percent on the month while imports were 1.2 percent up, data published on Tuesday showed.
It was the strongest export growth reading in 12 months, easing concerns that a stronger euro might dent sales of German goods and services abroad.
The figures suggest that the German economy, the euro zone's growth engine, is set for a solid expansion in the third quarter despite uncertainties about the make-up of the next government following national elections last month.
""While financial markets and the ECB have been discussing the risks of a stronger euro, the country which often claims to be export world champion is still enjoying a strong export recovery,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba wrote in a note.
""Despite the summer lull, the year 2017 should be the best year for German exports since 2010."" 
Both hard economic data and sentiment surveys have pointed to strong German growth in the July-September period and a solid expansion for the whole of 2017.
'BEST OF ALL WORLDS'
Industrial output posted its biggest monthly rise in more than six years in August, while an index for export expectations by the Ifo economic institute rose in September as soaring demand for German goods made manufacturers more optimistic.
The German economy grew by 0.7 percent on the quarter between January and March and by 0.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by household and state spending as consumers reaped the benefits of record-low borrowing costs and a low unemployment rate. 
The main risks to the German economy come from abroad, economists say.
""Geopolitical risks, a slowdown of the U.S. or UK economy and a deflating eu(ro)phoria could dent the strong growth momentum,"" said Brzeski. ""However, for the time being, the German economy is enjoying the best of all worlds: strong domestic demand and surging exports."" 
Both export and import growth was stronger than expected. A Reuters poll had pointed to exports rising 1.0 percent and imports jumping by 0.5 percent.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 21.6 billion euros ($25.4 billion) from a downwardly revised 19.3 billion euros in July. The August reading was higher than the Reuters consensus forecast of 20.0 billion euros.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, fell to 17.8 billion euros after an upwardly revised reading of 19.6 billion euros in July, unadjusted data showed.

Retail sales grew by an annual 1.9 percent on alike-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the British Retail Consortium said, up from 1.6 percent in August.
The increase follows other signs that consumers in Britain are adapting to the rise in inflation caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum decision to take the country out of the European Union in June 2016.
The Bank of England, which has signaled it is close to its first rate hike in a decade, is expecting a pick-up in spending.
The BRC said growth in total sales last month slowed slightly to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent in August but remained stronger than in most months so far this year.
However, consumers were not displaying much confidence in their shopping choices.
""Spending is still being focused towards essential purchases with consumers buying their winter coats and back-to-school items, but shying away from big-ticket items such as furniture and delaying the renewal of key household electrical goods,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.
On a like-for-like basis, food sales were up 2.5 percent in the three months to September while non-food sales were up only 0.5 percent, the BRC data showed.
The Confederation of British Industry said last month its measure of retail sales showed unexpected growth in sales to a two-year high in early September, again helped by strong food and clothing sales.

Accountancy firm BDO said on Friday that British shops enjoyed their biggest jump in sales in more than three years in September.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it made an error in its original calculations and that growth in unit labor costs - the cost to employers to produce a given amount of output - stood at an annual 2.4 percent in the second quarter, not 1.6 percent as reported on Friday. 
That earlier estimate failed to take into account a recent broad revision of how Britain's economy has fared in recent years, including higher income reported by self-employed people.
While the revised growth in unit labor costs was the slowest since the first three months of 2016, the increase compared with Friday's estimate would help officials at the BoE who want to raise interest rates now, an economist said.
""On the margins, this reinforces the view that the Bank of England might see problems up the line with domestically generated inflation,"" said Victoria Clarke, an economist with bank Investec.
British government bond prices fell slightly on Monday while prices of equivalent German bonds rose.
Most economists polled by Reuters last month said they thought the BoE would announce on Nov. 2 that it was raising interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.

The BoE said on Sept. 14 that most members of its Monetary Policy Committee thought it was likely that a hike would be needed ""in the coming months"" if inflationary pressure continued to build.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output posted its biggest monthly rise in more than six years in August, data showed on Monday.
It suggested the economy is firing on all cylinders again and set for solid growth in the third quarter, although a question about the make up of the new government could add uncertainty.
The combined production of manufacturing, construction and energy increased by 2.6 percent on the month after edging down by 0.1 percent in July, data from the Economy Ministry showed.
That was the strongest monthly gain since July 2011 and easily beat expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.7 percent rise, surpassing even the most optimistic estimate.
""These figures are very good,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said. He pointed to special factors such as plant holidays falling in July in some regions this year, meaning output was likely to come in weaker next month.
""Overall, we expect solid (GDP) growth in the third quarter. Our estimate is roughly 0.6 percent on the quarter,"" Solveen said.
Manufacturing output rose by 3.2 percent, its biggest rise since March 2010, as factories churned out more intermediate goods, capital goods and consumer goods in August. Energy output also rose while construction activity fell.
Manufacturers of cars and other vehicles were the main driver behind the overall surge, the ministry said, also pointing to earlier plant holidays.
The ministry said industrial production had gained momentum since the start of the year.
SOLID UPSWING
""The good business morale and the positive development in industrial orders point to a continuation of the solid industrial upswing,"" it said.
Data published on Friday showed that strong foreign demand, especially from clients outside the euro zone, drove a bigger-than-expected jump in industrial orders in August.
ING Bank chief economist Carsten Brzeski said the strong production data provided further evidence that the economy had left its summer lull behind and returned to maximum speed.
""With the expected investment program of the new government, the current cycle should be extended by another couple of years,"" Brzeski added.
The German economy grew 0.7 percent on the quarter in the first three months of the year and 0.6 percent from April to June, driven by increased household and state spending as well as higher investment in buildings and machinery.
Leading economic institutes have raised their growth forecast for the German economy to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018.
The German government will present its updated projections for GDP growth, employment and inflation on Wednesday.
""The outlook further ahead is positive too, with domestic demand supported by low unemployment and still loose monetary policy and the global environment supportive,"" Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said.
The economy might even benefit from a small post-election fiscal boost, McKeown said, adding she expected German GDP to rise by an even stronger rate of 2.3 percent this year.
The biggest risks to Germany's upswing come from the outside, Brzeski said, pointing to geopolitical risks, the stronger euro and a possible slowdown of the U.S. economy as a result of further absence of tax relief or investment programs.

Other risks include a slowdown of the British economy due to the continuing Brexit uncertainty and China's transition from an important export destination to a serious competitor, he added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in 21 months in September as new orders cooled, a private survey showed, blurring the picture of how the economy is performing heading into a key Communist Party Congress.
The findings of the Caixin/Markit survey reinforce views that China's smaller companies are continuing to struggle, while large state-owned giants are apparently reaping most of the benefits from a year-long, government-led construction boom.
However, many analysts believe China's robust industrial rally cannot be sustained much longer, putting pressure on policymakers to finds ways to energize the lackluster private sector, which accounts for over half of the country's investment and jobs.
The central bank threw a fresh lifeline to smaller firms last week in an attempt to redress that deep structural imbalance, offering an earnings booster to banks if they ramp up lending to more vulnerable sectors of the economy.
China is counting on growth in services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to reduce the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment.
But Monday's private survey suggested many services firms are facing a bumpy ride. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.6 in September, the lowest reading since December 2015 and one of the weakest since the survey began in 2005.
A reading above 50 indicates growth, and any lower signals contraction. The index had hit a three-month high in August. 
To be sure, the private findings were in sharp contrast to official data which showed services activity expanded at the fastest clip since 2014 in September.
But an official factory survey showed a similar trend, with big companies seeing strong improvements in business conditions while smaller ones struggled to grow, exposing a key fault line underneath the rosy headline growth numbers.
Still, Capital Economics' China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard, who has been among those predicting a broader slowdown, said it was too early to tell if the Caixin service survey pointed to a turning point just yet.
Retail sales over the just-ended Golden Week holiday rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, slowing but only slightly from the pace in 2016, data showed on Monday. 
""It is notable that there are signs of weakness in other parts of the economy and I do think services have softened a bit...I think we will see a slowdown in industrial production as well over the coming few months,"" Evans-Pritchard said. 
IS RECOVERY IN THE LATE INNINGS OR EXTRA INNINGS?
After China posted forecast-beating growth of 6.9 percent in the first half, analysts have said it was only a matter of time before it started to lose steam, especially as the government looks to contain the risks from an explosive build-up in debt, a campaign which is pushing up borrowing costs. 
Still, economists expect September data to be released over the next few weeks could show a bounce in activity after a slightly softer August, welcome news for leaders ahead of a twice-a-decade party congress that kicks off on Oct. 18.
Even if growth does start to fade, few China watchers see the risk of an economic hard landing. Beijing should easily meet or beat its full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent after the rousing start to the year.
""The Chinese economy generally held up well in the third quarter,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the PMI survey.
""However, the expansion in both manufacturing and services cooled in September, suggesting downward pressure on economic growth may re-emerge in the fourth quarter.""

The Office for National Statistics said it would correct the data later on Monday.

Consumer spending - adjusted for inflation and seasonal effects - rose by 1.4 percent in September after falling 0.4 percent month on month in August, Visa said, based on its credit and debit card data.
This was the biggest monthly rise since November, but still left overall spending in real terms 0.3 percent below its level a year ago.
Spending has fallen year-on-year for four of the past five months, the longest series of such declines since April 2013.
""Rising living costs, muted wage growth, and ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit negotiations and the strength of the UK economy continue to act as drags on household spending,"" said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data company IHS Markit, which compiled the data for Visa.
The upbeat tone in September month-on-month data echoed that in figures from the Confederation of British Industry, which reported the biggest annual increase in retail sales in two years in the early part of the month.
But Fiddes said overall expenditure remained on track for its weakest performance in four years.
The Bank of England is looking to see if consumer spending will recover from its weakness in the first half of the year as it prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.

The government stopped releasing price data more than a year ago, but congress has published its own figures since January and they have been close to private economists' estimates.
As well as the alarming Jan-Sept cumulative rise, the legislative body - which has been sidelined by President Nicolas Maduro's government - put monthly inflation at 36.3 percent for September, compared with 34 percent in August. 
Opponents say Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, have wrecked a once-prosperous economy with 18 years of state-led socialist policies from nationalizations to currency controls.
The government says it is victim of an ""economic war"", including speculation and hoarding, by pro-opposition businessmen. 
The country's bolivar currency has weakened sharply in recent weeks on the widely-watched black market rate. 
On Friday, $1 was worth nearly 27,000 bolivars on the black market, versus 22 when Maduro took power in April 2013 and 18,500 at the start of September this year. 
Opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado said the government's restriction of dollars available via official currency exchange mechanisms had pressured prices in September.
""The government strategy is only making Venezuelans poorer by the day,"" he said, adding that families were now spending 80 percent of income on food. 

Prices in Venezuela, which has long had one of the highest inflation rates in the world, rose 180.9 percent in 2015 and 274 percent in 2016, according to official figures, although many economists believe the real data was worse.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 10:42AM ET</span>","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma sink U.S. payrolls in September","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment fell in September for the first time in seven years as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring, the latest indication that the storms undercut economic activity in the third quarter.
The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls decreased by 33,000 jobs last month amid a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector.
The decline in payrolls was the first since September 2010. The Department said its analysis suggested that the net effect of Harvey and Irma, which wreaked havoc in Texas and Florida in late August and early September, was to ""reduce the estimate of total nonfarm payroll employment for September.""
""While nonfarm payrolls declined last month, investors will find solace in a whole host of other labor market indicators that reveal an underlying labor market that continues to show evidence of resilience and continued tightening,"" said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 90,000 jobs last month. Payrolls are calculated from a survey of employers, which treats any worker who was not paid for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month as unemployed.
Many of the dislocated people will probably return to work. That, together with rebuilding and clean-up is expected to boost job growth in the coming months. Leisure and hospitality payrolls dived 111,000, the most since records started in 1939, after being unchanged in August.
There were also decreases in retail and manufacturing employment last month. Stripping out the effects of the hurricanes, the labor market remains strong. The government revised data for August to show 169,000 jobs created that month instead of the previously reported 156,000.
Harvey and Irma did not have an impact on the unemployment rate, which fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.2 percent, the lowest since February 2001. The smaller survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived treats a person as employed regardless of whether they missed work during the reference week and were unpaid as result.
The decrease in the unemployment rate reflected a 906,000 surge in household employment, which offset a 575,000 increase in the labor force.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street fell marginally.
DISRUPTIONS BOOST WAGES
Underscoring the disruptive impact of the hurricanes, the household survey showed 1.5 million people stayed at home in September because of the bad weather, the most since January 1996. About 2.9 million people worked part-time, the largest number since February 2014.
The length of the average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours. With the hurricane-driven temporary unemployment concentrated in low-paying industries like retail and leisure and hospitality, average hourly earnings increased 12 cents or 0.5 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August.
That pushed the annual increase in wages to 2.9 percent, the largest gain since December 2016, from 2.7 percent in August.
The mixed employment report should not change views the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that the hurricanes could ""substantially"" weigh on September job growth, but expected the effects would ""unwind relatively quickly.""
""The Fed has been hyper-focused on wage growth, so the above-average increase will be a welcome relief, even if there is some storm impact embedded in the number,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. ""We think that the report strengthens the Fed's December hike hand.""
The U.S. central bank said last month it expected ""labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."" The Fed left interest rates unchanged in September, but signaled it expected one more hike by the end of the year. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
Annual wage growth of at least 3.0 percent is need to raise inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target, analysts say.
The employment report added to August consumer spending, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales data in suggesting that the hurricanes will dent economic growth in the third quarter.
Economists estimate that the back-to-back storms, including Hurricane Maria which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico last month, could shave at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter gross domestic product.
Growth estimates for the July-September period are as low as a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter.
Private payrolls fell by 40,000 jobs, the biggest drop since February 2010. Manufacturing employment slipped by 1,000 jobs pulled down by declines at motor vehicle assembly and chemical plants as well as textile mills.

Retail employment fell by 2,900 jobs as food stores payrolls tumbled 6,900. There were also declines in employment at department stores. Construction payrolls rose 8,000 in September as a 3,900 drop in jobs at homebuilding sites was offset by increases elsewhere.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.9 percent, the biggest gain since November 2016, after an unrevised 0.6 percent increase in July. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories jumped 1.0 percent in August.
The government said while it could not isolate the impact of Harvey on the data, it had received indications from companies that the storm, which slammed Texas in late August, had both ""positive and negative effects on wholesale data.""
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.8 percent in August.
That suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP in the third quarter after adding just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the 3.1 percent annualized pace of growth in the April-June period.
Inventory investment, business spending on equipment and trade are seen cushioning the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on third-quarter GDP. The storms are expected to chop off at least six-tenths of a percentage point from economic growth in the July-September period.
Growth estimates for the third quarter are as low as a 1.8 percent rate.
After carefully managing inventories early in the year amid sluggish consumer spending, businesses are boosting stocks to meet rising domestic demand. Auto inventories increased 2.2 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in July.
Sales at wholesalers leapt 1.7 percent in August, the biggest increase since December 2016, after being unchanged in July. Sales of motor vehicles surged 4.2 percent in August after falling 0.7 percent the prior month.
At August's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.28 months to clear shelves, down from 1.29 months in July.

Non-farm payrolls declined by 33,000 in September, compared to the rise of 169,000 a month earlier that was revised up from the initial increase of 156,000. The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 90,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly ticked down to 4.2% last month. Economists had expected no change from August's reading of 4.4%.
Average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.5% in September, beating forecasts for a gain of 0.3% and compared to the prior 0.2% advance.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector unexpectedy destroyed 40,000 jobs in September, compared to consensus expectations for the creation of 83,000 jobs. August's number was revised down to 164,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 165,000.
Government payrolls increased by 7,000 last month, compared to creation of 5,000 jobs in August, revised from an initial loss of 9,000 positions.
The participation rate ticked up to 63.1% in September from 62.9% the previous month.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, fell to 8.3% last month from 8.6% in August.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours remained unchanged at 34.4 in September, in line with expectations.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",UK productivity falls at joint-fastest rate since 2013: ONS,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British productivity fell at its joint-fastest rate since 2013 in the 12 months after the country voted to leave the European Union, data showed on Friday, underscoring the main challenge facing the economy as Brexit approaches.
Britain has long struggled to squeeze more output from its workers as many companies have been hiring extra staff rather than investing in new equipment. That has resulted in unemployment falling to its lowest level in more than 40 years even as wage growth has been weak.
British workers' output per hour last year was more than 15 percent below that in other major advanced economies, a gap that has widened sharply since the 2008 financial crisis and shows no sign of narrowing significantly.
Output per hour worked in the three months to June was 0.3 percent below its level in the three months to June 2016, the Office for National Statistics said. No bigger fall has been recorded since the third quarter of 2013.
Before the crisis, annual productivity growth averaged more than 2 percent.
Economists mostly think Brexit - which raises the prospect of fewer skilled workers coming to Britain and less access to Britain's key EU export markets - will make catching up even harder.
""A major risk is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK's economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations would increase this risk,"" said Howard Archer, economist at consultants EY ITEM Club.
Weaker productivity will also weigh on Britain's public finances, complicating the task of finance minister Philip Hammond as he prepares an annual budget statement for Nov. 22.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent government agency that produces budget forecasts, predicted in March that output per hour would grow 1.4 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2018.
However the OBR, like most economic forecasters, has been over-optimistic on British productivity growth in the past.
The Financial Times said the OBR would cut its assumptions about future productivity growth and lower its overall economic growth forecasts as a result, leaving Hammond with less room to raise public spending if a slowdown in the economy worsens.
Slower productivity increases the amount of Britain's budget deficit that has to be reduced by spending cuts or tax hikes, rather than disappearing of its own accord as the economy grows.
""It's certainly going to cause the chancellor a lot more trouble than he was hoping,"" Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, told BBC radio.
The risk of weaker productivity growth, due in part to economic disruption caused by Brexit, is also a key reason why the Bank of England is pressing ahead with plans to reverse last year's cut in interest rates.
Governor Mark Carney has said the pace the economy can grow without generating excessive inflation has fallen. Most BoE policymakers have said they expect to raise rates for the first time in over a decade in the coming months, if the economy develops as expected.
But Friday's data showed that a key gauge of domestic inflation pressures had fallen.

Annual growth in unit labor costs - the cost to employers to produce a given amount of output - was its slowest in over a year at 1.6 percent, down from 2.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>",Japan's economy likely posted second best stretch of post-war growth: index,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely posted its equal second-best stretch of uninterrupted post-war growth, a government index for August showed on Friday, a nod to strong global demand and premier Shinzo Abe's aggressive stimulus measures.
The latest reading comes as Abe heads to a general election later this month and puts his ""Abenomics"" policies in the spotlight. However, despite the strong headline number, analysts say the benefits of growth have failed to reach broader sectors of the economy with generally anemic wages leaving households behind.
The index of coincident economic indicators rose a preliminary 1.9 points to 117.6 in August from the previous month, the level seen in March 2014, the Cabinet Office said. This would mark 57 straight months of growth, matching the second-best stretch of expansion since World War Two, seen between 1965 to 1970.
""I don't feel the economy has been growing and I'm not in a mood to spend on luxury things. I need to save money for my child's education and for when I retire as I don't think I will get enough pension to make ends meet,"" said Satoko Sakuma, 57 years old, a part-time worker in the elderly care industry.
The coincident index is used to measure the state of the economy and is among indicators the government uses when deciding whether the economy is expanding or in recession. It includes a range of readings such as factory output, employment and retail sales.
Under the government's definition, the economy has been in an expansion since December 2012, when Abe came into office. The economy posted its best stretch of consecutive monthly growth of 73 months from February 2002 to February 2008.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.
But while there has been some economic momentum, it remains historically modest: the economy grew an average 1.2 percent during the current expansion, much slower than 11.4 percent average growth during the 1965 to 1970 expansion, SMBC Nikko Securities said.
Other data on Friday showed Japanese workers' wages rose in August from a year earlier in a sign of a gradual pick-up in household income.
And a Bank of Japan survey showed households' mood improved in September from three months ago, though fewer of them expected prices to rise a year from now.
The jobless rate, which was at 4.3 percent when Abe took office, fell to 2.8 percent in August. Corporate earnings rose 75 percent during the period, as the yen fell more than 30 percent and the Nikkei stock average doubled in value.
""Companies have enjoyed record profits but wages aren't growing much,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Most of the increase in corporate profits came from factors like falling oil costs and a weak yen, and the recovery in sales wasn't as strong as past economic expansions. This is making companies cautious of raising wages.""
Some economists say companies may keep hoarding cash as they see little growth prospects in Japan's rapidly aging society.
""It's hard to predict the future so companies tend to save cash. They can't raise prices as they may lose customers,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Research Institute.
""It would be better if the economy sees growth stabilize above its potential.""

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 02:00AM ET</span>",Japan August machinery orders seen up for second straight month,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders were seen rising moderately in August after showing robust growth in July, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, suggesting capital investment may be on a firmer footing.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, likely rose 1.1 percent in August from the previous month, a Reuters poll of 16 economists found.
Machinery orders jumped 8.0 percent in July, the fastest gain since January 2016.
Core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, were seen rising 0.8 percent in August from a year ago after posting an annual 7.5 percent fall in July.
""Core machinery orders likely slowed down after their higher growth. But upbeat corporate earnings support firms' appetite for investment,"" said survey respondent Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. 
Analysts say the need to invest in labor-saving equipment and renew aging facilities, as well as construction demand for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, are supporting corporate capital investment.
Positive though these developments may be, some analysts say capital investment does not yet have the power to boost the broader economy.
""Firms' capital spending is on a rising trend but it is not yet showing signs it could accelerate its sustainable growth and it has not gained enough momentum to lead the economy,"" Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said in the survey.
The Cabinet Office will publish the machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
The finance ministry will issue the August current account balance on Tuesday, which is seen likely to show a 2.26 trillion yen ($20 billion) surplus, the poll found.
It would be the 38th straight monthly current account surplus, thanks to a strong trade balance from upbeat exports and the weak yen which also boosts income from overseas investments.
The poll found the Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI) was expected to rise 3.0 percent in September from a year earlier, led by rising prices for oil products.
CGPI, which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, was seen up 0.2 percent in September from August. 
The BOJ is due to publish the index on Thursday.

The IHS Markit/Recruitment and Employment Confederation said permanent roles filled by recruitment firms rose at the weakest pace in five months.
The fall in placements in London reflected recruitment problems facing the financial sector in particular, REC's monthly Report on Jobs showed.
A slowdown in the number European Union nationals coming to work in Britain had exacerbated a shortage of staff, REC said.
""Low-skill roles are also hard to fill in areas like food processing, warehouses and catering – sectors that employ a higher proportion of people from the EU than others across the economy,"" REC chief executive Kevin Green said.
Last month the Bank of England said most of its policymakers believed that interest rates would probably need to rise from a record low in the coming months, if the economy and price pressures keep growing. 
The central bank believes Brexit will reduce the number of migrants coming to Britain, pushing up pay and adding to inflation pressure.
The REC survey showed the sharpest fall in candidates for permanent jobs in four months while growth in starting salaries for permanent staff eased only slightly in September from August's 22-month high.
Recent economic figures have painted a mixed picture of Britain's economy. 
New car registrations are on track for their first annual fall since 2011, while business surveys have shown falling confidence in the economic outlook after a slow first half of the year. 
Earlier on Friday, accountancy firm BDO said overall like-for-like store sales rose by an annual 2.9 percent - the biggest rise in more than three years and adding to a smaller rise in August.

However, the increase was distorted by weak sales in September 2016, suggesting underlying growth remained slow.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Revenues for the $6 billion payday loan industry will shrivel under a new U.S. rule restricting lenders' ability to profit from high-interest, short-term loans, and much of the business could move to small banks, according to the country's consumer financial watchdog. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released a regulation on Thursday requiring lenders to determine if borrowers can repay their debts and capping the number of loans lenders can make to a borrower. 
The long-anticipated rule still must survive two major challenges before becoming effective in 2019. Republican lawmakers, who often say CFPB regulations are too onerous, want to nullify it in Congress, and the industry has already threatened lawsuits.
Mostly low-income earners use what are known as payday loans - small-dollar advances typically repaid on the borrower's next payday - for emergency expenses. The lenders generally do not evaluate credit reports for loan eligibility.
Under the new rule, the industry’s revenue will plummet by two-thirds, the CFPB estimated. 
The current business model relies on borrowers needing to refinance or roll over existing loans. They pay fees and additional interest that increase lenders' profits, CFPB Director Richard Cordray said on a call with reporters. 
“Lenders actually prefer customers who will re-borrow repeatedly,"" he said.
People trapped in that debt cycle can end up paying the equivalent of 300 percent interest, the bureau found in a study it conducted during five years of writing the rule.
The rule will devastate an industry serving nearly 30 million customers annually, said Ed D'Alessio, executive director of the Financial Service Centers of America, an industry trade group.
""Taking away their access to this line of credit means many more Americans will be left with no choice but to turn to the unregulated loan industry, overseas and elsewhere, while others will simply bounce checks and suffer under the burden of greater debt,"" he said.
BRINGING BANKS INTO THE MIX 
The agency narrowed the final version of the regulation to focus on short-term borrowings, instead of also including longer-term and installment debt. It exempted many community banks and credit unions from having to ensure borrowers can repay loans, as well. 
Both moves could make it easier for financial institutions to fill gaps left by payday lenders who close shop under the new rule.
""Banks and credit unions have shown a willingness to serve these customers with small installment loans, and they can do it at prices that are six times lower than payday loans,"" said Nick Bourke, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' consumer finance project. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday lifted restrictions that kept banks from making small-dollar loans, which will further aid in the transition. 
The leading bank lobby group, the American Bankers Association, applauded the CFPB and OCC, and the trade group representing independent banks, Independent Community Bankers of America, said the exemption provides flexibility to make sustainable loans to customers in need.
But the Community Bankers Association representing retail institutions said only the smallest banks qualify for the exemption, which applies to lenders making 2,500 or fewer short-term loans per year and deriving no more than 10 percent of revenue from those loans. 

""The CFPB whiffed at an opportunity to provide assistance to the millions of Americans experiencing financial hardship,” CBA President Richard Hunt said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, but the continued impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the data made it difficult to get a clear picture of the labor market.
Other data on Thursday pointed to underlying economic strength despite the weather-related disruptions. The trade deficit narrowed in August as exports of goods and services rose to more than a 2-1/2-year high. Orders for core capital goods were stronger in August than previously reported. 
The reports suggested that trade and business spending on equipment could help to offset some of the anticipated drag on third-quarter economic growth from the storms.
""Today's reports on August trade and factory goods ... add upside risk to our forecast for GDP growth in the third quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Sept. 30, the Labor Department said. 
Harvey and Irma along with Hurricane Maria affected claims for Texas, Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, a Labor Department official said. Economists had forecast claims falling to 265,000 in the latest week. 
Claims shot up from a low of 236,000 in late August, hitting an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September. As a result, Harvey and Irma are expected to cut into job growth in September. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 90,000 jobs last month after rising by 156,000 in August. 
The labor market disruptions are expected to be temporary, with the job market generally remaining strong. 
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 135 consecutive weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The dollar (DXY) firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the three main U.S. indexes hitting fresh record highs. 
STRONG BUSINESS SPENDING In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap declined 2.7 percent to $42.4 billion, the smallest since September 2016. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit was little changed at $61.8 billion. 
The so-called real trade deficit average for July and August was below the second-quarter average of $62.4 billion. 
That suggests trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the third quarter and help to soften the economic blow of the hurricanes, which are expected to cut at least six-tenths of a percentage point from economic growth in the third quarter. Trade added two-tenths of a percentage point to the second quarter's 3.1 percent annualized growth pace. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter are as low as a 1.8 percent rate. In August, exports of goods and services increased 0.4 percent to $195.3 billion, the highest level since December 2014. Exports to China increased 8.8 percent.
Imports of goods and services dipped 0.1 percent to $237.7 billion in August, with imports of industrial supplies and materials hitting their lowest level since November 2016.
""We expect upbeat external demand and a more competitive currency to support export growth, while reasonable domestic demand should continue to pull in imports at a moderate pace,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Imports of goods from China rose 5.1 percent to a record high. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased 4.0 percent to $34.9 billion in August, the highest level since September 2015.
In another report, the Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business spending plans - jumped 1.1 percent in August instead of the 0.9 percent increase reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, shot up 1.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent rise.
Strong business spending on equipment is helping to underpin manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Business investment in equipment grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the second quarter. 

""Trends in capital goods shipments point to a pickup in business equipment investment in the third quarter, and the strength of orders suggests this may be sustained toward the end of the year,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

PARIS (Reuters) - Surging investment has put the French economy on course for its best growth since 2011 this year, the INSEE official statistics agency said on Thursday, slightly raising its earlier estimate.
INSEE forecast the economy would now grow 1.8 percent this year, finally leaving behind the low growth rates of around 1.0 percent that France has struggled to break out of in recent years.
The forecast topped INSEE's estimate of 1.6 percent in June and also exceeded the 1.7 percent the government is expecting.
INSEE also said it expected the economy to cruise ahead at a quarterly growth rate of 0.5 percent through to the end of the year, logging five consecutive quarters at that rate.
Households and companies were ramping up investment due to low interest rates and relatively high business confidence, lifting the overall economic outlook, INSEE said in a quarterly report. 
French business confidence has surged since President Emmanuel Macron won election in May on a reform agenda, while French companies have also benefited from a broader rebound in euro zone economies.
Household investment - primarily new home purchases - would hit an 11-year high of 5.0 percent this year while business investment would reach 3.9 percent as companies expand capacity to keep up with growing demand, INSEE estimated.
As tourist numbers recover following several tough years with global trade improving, exports were seen rebounding in the second half of the year despite the euro's strength, with the euro up by some 11 percent so far this year against the dollar.
However, strong imports, fueled by firm demand at home, would mean that overall foreign trade would remain a slight drag on the economy, though less than in recent years.
Consumer spending growth would ease as inflation ate into households' purchasing power, INSEE said, predicting consumer prices would rise 1.0 percent this year compared with only 0.2 percent last year.
On the labor market, private sector payrolls were seen growing by 208,000 this year, although growth slow toward the end of the year as the government reins in subsidized jobs.

The overall improvement would bring the jobless rate down to 9.4 percent by the end of the year, compared with 10 percent at the end of last year.

Factory goods orders increased 1.2 percent as demand for a range of goods rose, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Orders fell by an unrevised 3.3 percent in July. 
Economists had forecast factory orders increasing 1.0 percent in August. The Commerce Department said it was unable to isolate the impact of Harvey and Irma on the data as the survey is ""designed to estimate the month-to-month change in manufacturing activity at the national level and not at specific geographic areas.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business spending plans - jumped 1.1 percent in August instead of the 0.9 percent increase reported last month. 
Orders for these so-called core capital goods advanced 1.3 percent in July. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, shot up 1.1 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent rise.
Strong business spending on equipment is helping to underpin manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Business investment in equipment grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the second quarter. 
Spending is rising despite signs of slowing oil and gas drilling as ample supplies restrain crude oil prices. 
In August, orders for machinery gained 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent in July. Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders dropped 5.1 percent after leaping 3.7 percent in July.
Orders for transportation equipment advanced 5.1 percent, reflecting a 44.8 percent surge in civilian aircraft orders. 
Motor vehicle orders rose 0.7 percent after declining 2.2 percent in July. Further gains are likely in September as residents in the areas ravaged by Harvey and Irma replace flood-damaged vehicles. Major automakers on Tuesday posted higher U.S. new motor vehicle sales for September.

Motor vehicle sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 18.57 million units in September from 17.72 million units a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the trade gap declined 2.7 percent to $42.4 billion. July's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $43.6 billion from the previously reported $43.7 billion. 
The department said the effects of Harvey and Irma along with Hurricane Maria would be ""embedded in source data"" for trade, and the impact of the hurricanes will likely be ""reflected in subsequent trade reports until normal trade activities resume in affected areas.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall narrowing to $42.7 billion in August. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit was little changed at $61.8 billion. The so-called real trade deficit in August was below the second-quarter average of $62.4 billion. 
While that suggests trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the third quarter, a rise in commodity prices after Harvey disrupted oil and gas operations along the Texas coast could push up the trade deficit in September. 
Harvey and Irma, which struck Florida last month, are expected to cut at least six-tenths of a percentage point from economic growth in the third quarter. Trade added two-tenths of a percentage point to the second quarter's 3.1 percent annualized growth pace. 
In August, exports of goods and services increased 0.4 percent to $195.3 billion, the highest level since December 2014. Goods exports were the highest since April 2015. 
Exports to China increased 8.8 percent. Imports of goods and services dipped 0.1 percent to $237.7 billion in August. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the lowest since November 2016.

Imports of goods from China increased 5.1 percent to a record high. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 4.0 percent to $34.9 billion in August, the highest level since September 2015.

(Reuters) - U.S. companies scaled back their hiring to an 11-month low in September after two powerful hurricanes disrupted some business activities, while the vast domestic services sector overcame those snags to expand at its fastest pace in 12 years.
The latest data helped soothe investors who have been worried about Hurricanes Harvey and Irma dragging on U.S. economic growth. 
""We have to at least entertain the notion that an economy that was already in pretty solid shape cyclically is picking up momentum heading into the fall,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. 
The Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 59.8, the highest since August 2005. 
The September figure topped expectations of 55.5 from a Reuters poll of economists and was up from 55.3 the month before. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.
The two storms did cause delays in supply deliveries and a drawdown on inventories, according to ISM.
U.S. companies added 135,000 jobs in September, the smallest monthly increase since October 2016, as Harvey and Irma ""significantly impacted smaller retailers,"" the ADP National Employment Report showed earlier on Wednesday.
Still, those gains managed to top economist expectations for an addition of 125,000 jobs. 
Private employers likely reduced their hiring by 50,000 to 60,000 last month due to disruptions from Harvey and Irma, Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said on a conference call.
Wall Street's three major equity indexes were modestly lower after the ADP and ISM data but later reversed losses and climbed to record highs. Bond yields rose and the dollar pared initial losses.

Sales fell 35.1 percent from September 2016, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said in a report. It was the sixth straight month of declining year-on-year sales after a years-long boom that sparked fears of a bubble.
The average selling price was up 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier, while new listings and days on the market both rose, TREB said. Market watchers have been waiting to see if buyers and sellers would come back to the market after taking to the sidelines during the traditionally slow summer months.
The average selling price for all home types combined was C$775,546 ($621,680), down 15.5 percent from a peak of C$918,285 in April. 
The Ontario government introduced multiple measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, in a bid to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding areas.

The central bank aims to maintain the inflation-adjusted interest rate steady, and as inflation fell sharply last month the bank is now reacting by lowering its key rate to 4.25 percent from 4.50 percent.
In September the country's consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.4 percent year-on-year down from an increase of 1.7 percent in August.
""Measures of underlying inflation are even lower, and falling,"" the central bank said in a statement.
""It does look like the central bank at the moment is just responding to changes in actual inflation,"" economist Stephen Brown from Capital Economics said.
He had thought that rate cuts were off the table for the time being following the collapse of the government last month and the upcoming snap election that may install a left-wing government, prone to a looser fiscal policy.
The central bank cut the rate in June for the fourth time in less than a year in response to a tourism boom that has strengthened the crown currency.
""The outlook is for GDP growth to be weaker this year than in 2016, in part because growth in tourism has eased,"" the central bank said on Wednesday.
It added that the rate of GDP growth will nevertheless remain ""robust"".

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 05:32AM ET</span>",China September data to show steady growth ahead of key Communist Party congress,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese data in coming weeks is expected to deliver exactly what its leaders want to hear ahead of a highly sensitive Communist Party Congress - the country's economic growth remains robust and resilient even as they work to get debt risks under control.
The twice-a-decade party congress that kicks off on Oct. 18 is expected to see President Xi Jinping strengthen his grip in a leadership reshuffle, and will set the political and economic policy tone for China for the next five years.
So far this year, the world's second-biggest economy has held up better than expected despite views that a clampdown on riskier types of financing and a flurry of measures to cool heated housing prices will drag on activity.
But many economists still contend growth will fade in coming months under the weight of higher borrowing costs, property curbs and the government-mandated shutdown of some highly polluting factories to reduce winter air pollution.
The boost from heavy government stimulus -- Beijing's infrastructure spending spree has helped fuel a year-long construction boom -- will also begin to ebb, skeptics argue.
Still, economists polled by Reuters expect China's economy is heading into the fourth quarter with plenty of momentum.
Growth in industrial output is expected to accelerate to 6.2 percent from a year earlier, from August's 6 percent, according to a Reuters poll of 24 economists.
Steel mills are believed to be running at full steam to cash in on strong demand and prices, and to build up inventories in case they are ordered to reduce output over winter.
Fixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.7 percent in the first three quarters on-year, only slightly softer than a 7.8 percent rise in January-August.
Retail sales growth is seen edging up to 10.2 percent.
China's trade performance is also expected to improve after softer-than-expected readings in August raised questions about the sustainability of its domestic and export demand.
Exports are expected to have risen 8.8 percent on-year, while imports may have jumped 13.5 percent, producing a trade surplus of $39.5 billion. A pullback in the strong yuan currency in recent weeks may be giving exporters some relief.
GROWTH VERSUS DEBT
While there is little worry of an economic hard landing, debt risks appear to be back on the radar as Beijing continues to pump out more credit to keep activity humming. 
S&P Global Ratings downgraded the country's credit rating last month, saying China's attempts to reduce risks from its rapid build-up in debt are not working as quickly as expected and credit growth is still too fast.
China in July set up a new financial stability committee under the State Council to coordinate financial oversight, with the central bank taking on a bigger role. 
The People's Bank of China early this year included off-balance sheet wealth management products in its Macro  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Assessment (MPA) for the first time to give authorities a better sense of potential risks to the financial system. 
September's loan data will be closely watched for signs of where policy may be going next, as banks have shifted more credit back onto their books in response to the clampdown on shadow financing.
Chinese banks are seen extending 1.1 trillion yuan ($165.33 billion) in new loans in September, up from 1.09 trillion yuan in August.
Credit growth could get an extra boost in coming months after the PBOC on Saturday cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves for the first time since February 2016. The move is linked with a policy to encourage more lending to struggling smaller firms and the private sector.
It could trigger a flurry of lending as banks look to qualify for lower reserve requirement ratios (RRR) which go into effect in 2018, though some analysts believe the impact on the economy may be tempered if Beijing continues its campaign to rein in debt risks at the same time. 
""We believe the RRR cut may not lead to a quick pickup in total credit growth if policy makers continue to strictly enforce the macroprudential assessment (MPA) framework and the new rules related to the financial system cleanup,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note to clients. 
Inflation data may also offer clues on firms' debt-servicing capability.
The producer price index (PPI) is tipped to have risen 6.3 percent in September on-year, steady from August. 
Profits at industrial companies rose the most in four years in August as commodities prices surged, though a Reuters analysis showed few listed firms have used the windfall this year to retire their debt. 
Again, analysts predict producer prices will start to soften in the fourth quarter due to a high base of comparison last year and as overall demand moderates along with economic growth.
The consumer price index (CPI) meanwhile is seen up 1.6 percent on-year in September, versus 1.8 percent in August and well within Beijing's 2017 target of 3 percent.
Besides the campaign to reduce high levels of debt across the economy, authorities have also been trying to reduce the risk from capital flight by stabilizing the yuan currency.
China's foreign exchange reserves are expected to have risen for an eighth month to $3.1 trillion in September, as capital curbs and a weakening dollar helped staunch fund outflows.
China is due to announce foreign exchange reserves data on Oct. 7, followed by trade and inflation data on Oct. 13 and Oct. 16 respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from Oct. 10 to Oct. 15.

The data will lead up to third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Oct. 19. China's economy grew 6.9 percent in the first half, and is expected to easily meet or beat the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>","UK economy stuck in low gear, worries grow as BoE prepares to hike rates: PMI","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy remained stuck in low gear in the third quarter but price pressures grew further, according to a business survey that probably keeps the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also showed businesses were increasingly worried about the outlook as Britain heads towards its departure from the European Union with little clear sign of its future trading relationship.
The PMI showed growth in services activity unexpectedly sped up a little last month, compensating for weaker readings in the manufacturing and construction industries reported earlier in the week.
Taking the three sector surveys together, Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly rate of around 0.3 percent in the July-September period, matching its second-quarter performance, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
""The surveys ... portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The services PMI picked up to 53.6 in September, slightly better than expectations in a Reuters poll of economists for it to hold at August's level of 53.2.
Despite the improvement, growth among British firms lagged behind that of its peers in a resurgent euro zone.
There were also some discouraging signs for the months ahead: new orders increased at the weakest pace since August last year, inflation pressures jumped at the fastest pace for several months and confidence sagged.
Services companies cited Brexit-related uncertainty and worries about the economy as reasons for their darker mood.
Britain's economy initially withstood the shock of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union. But growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose following the pound's post-Brexit vote plunge, which hit the spending power of households.
Against that background, the BoE surprised investors last month when it said most of its interest rate-setters believed they were likely to raise borrowing costs soon, citing a reduced tolerance for above-target inflation.
Costs faced by services companies rose at the fastest pace since February, while they hiked selling prices at the quickest rate in five months, suggesting inflation could top 3 percent in the coming months.
""The rise in price pressures will pour further fuel on expectations that the Bank of England will soon follow-up on its increasingly hawkish rhetoric and hike interest rates,"" Williamson said.
IHS Markit's composite PMI, which combines services, manufacturing and construction, edged down to a seven-month low of 53.6 in September - leaving it some way off levels that would normally be consistent with BoE rate hikes.

1467,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 04:35AM ET</span>",U.K. Services PMI Edges Up from August's Recent Low,"Investing.com - The U.K.'s giant services sector expanded at a faster rate than expected in September, easing concerns over the economy and supporting the case for higher interest rates, industry data showed on Wednesday.
Market research firm Markit said that its U.K. services purchasing managers' index rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 last month from a reading of 53.2 in August. Economists had expected the index to hold steady in September.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Service providers remained under pressure from sharply rising operating expenses, which contributed to the fastest rate of prices charged inflation since April.
At the same time, relatively subdued domestic demand acted as a drag on activity growth, with the latest rise in incoming new work the slowest for 13 months.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at survey compilers Markit said, “The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth.""
He added that, ""The rise in price pressures will pour further fuel on expectations that the Bank of England will soon follow-up on its increasingly hawkish rhetoric and hike interest rates.""
GBP/USD was trading at 1.3277 from around 1.3255 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8860 from 0.8875 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets remained mixed. London’s FTSE 100 shed 0.1%, the EURO STOXX 50 dipped 0.1%, France's CAC 40 lost 0.2%, while Germany's DAX tacked on 0.2%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business across the euro zone grew rapidly in September as firms struggled to keep up with demand, a survey showed on Wednesday, with October looking likely to be lively as well.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone bounced to 56.7 last month from August's 55.7, in line with an earlier flash estimate and comfortably above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
A sub-index measuring new orders jumped, while one for backlogs of work climbed to 54.3 from 53.0, its highest since February 2011, suggesting the increase in the pace of activity was not enough to keep up.
""The economy enters the fourth quarter with business energized by inflows of new orders growing at the fastest rate for over six years and expectations of future growth reviving after a summer lull,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI pointed to third-quarter economic growth of 0.7 percent, faster than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry rose to 55.8 from 54.7, ahead of the preliminary reading of 55.6. That increase came despite firms hiking prices at the second-fastest rate in over six years. The output price index was 51.8 last month, up from 51.3.
Euro zone inflation undershot expectations in September, Eurostat data showed last week, highlighting how price growth remains weak and supporting the European Central Bank's case for only gradual removal of its extraordinary stimulus.

A Reuters poll of economists in September suggested the ECB will announce on Oct. 26 a six-month extension to its asset purchase program but will cut how much it buys each month to 40 billion euros from January.

The Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the sector rose to 55.2 in September from 54.2 in August. The index has held above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction since February 2016.
Panelists said strong demand from both foreign and domestic clients drove the rise in new orders. An improvement in market conditions also supported business confidence, they said, with output expectations for the coming year rising to an eight-month high.
""New business expanded at the fastest pace since December 2012, which supported further employment growth. Notably, workforce numbers rose at the quickest rate since May 2013,"" IHS Markit economist Sian Jones said.

Earlier this week, another PMI survey showed Russian manufacturing activity increased in September, driven by stronger output and new orders as well as an increase in export orders for the first time since August 2013.
"
1470,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2017 09:00PM ET</span>",Japan September services PMI shows growth slowest in 11 months,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's services sector expanded in September at the slowest rate in 11 months as the pace of new orders eased, though a raft of other data suggest the economic recovery remains intact even as momentum may have ebbed slightly in the third quarter.
The Markit/Nikkei survey released on Wednesday showed its Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.0 from 51.6 in August.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 12th consecutive month but was at the lowest level since October 2016.
The new business index also showed expansion at a reduced pace, down at 52.0 in September from 52.4 in August.
In one positive sign, the index for business sentiment rose to 53.3 from 52.4 in the previous month, suggesting companies believe the lull in activity is temporary.
""Softer growth in new work squeezed activity to its slowest growth rate in nearly a year, while job creation remained modest,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Weaker activity growth, however, has not fueled a further slide in business confidence, which picked up moderately following a 13-month low in August.""
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 51.7 in September from 51.9 in the previous month.
Japan's economy grew an annualized 2.5 percent in April-June, which was the fastest pace of growth in more than a year thanks to gains in consumer spending and housing investment.
Economists have said this pace is unsustainable and expect growth to slow slightly in July-September. However, many remain confident the economy will continue to motor at a healthy clip, driven by a boom in exports and rising domestic demand.
In fact, the manufacturing PMI released on Monday showed Japanese factory activity in September expanded at the fastest pace in four months, driven by growth in domestic and export orders.
A Bank of Japan survey also showed that big manufacturers have more confidence in business conditions than they have had for a decade.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2017 07:01PM ET</span>",Hurricane recovery helps boost U.S. September new auto sales,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country replaced flood-damaged cars, extending a rally in their shares that began when Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas in late August.
Analysts and industry consultants had predicted hurricanes Harvey and Irma would provide automakers with their first monthly gains in 2017. Sales had been weak after a strong run since 2010 that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016.
But others warned high inventory levels and record consumer discounts remained a concern moving forward.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of U.S. car and light truck sales in September rose to 18.57 million units from 17.72 million units a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales.
While U.S. sales rose beyond the storm zones, according to automakers and dealers, much of the September gains came after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas. Replacing cars during the recovery in southeast Texas and Florida will boost U.S. new and used auto sales through at least November, according to industry consultants.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) stock rose more than 3 percent to its highest level since its 2010 post-bankruptcy initial public offering, and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co closed up more than 2 percent at $12.34.
While the hurricane recovery drove sales, ""this will be a short-lived party,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for online sales site Autotrader. 
Up to 500,000 cars were damaged or destroyed during Harvey and another 200,000 cars during Irma, according to industry estimates.
GM's sales jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker's inventory fell to 76 days' supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles. GM is moving closer to its goal of around 70 days' supply by the end of the year. 
The ""overall strength of the U.S. economy is the main force driving the market,"" said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem, with recovery in hurricane-damaged areas ""spurring new and used vehicle sales."" 
GM said new car sales to consumers were up 14 percent in the region that includes Texas.
Industrywide, new car sales in the Houston area, the fourth-most populous U.S. city, soared 109 percent in the three weeks after Hurricane Harvey compared with the three weeks before the storm, according to car shopping website Edmunds.
'STRONG END OF THE MONTH'
Ford sales rose 8.7 percent in September, with those to consumers up 4.4 percent and lower-margin fleet sales up 25.1 percent. F-Series pickup truck sales soared 21.4 percent, benefiting from the popularity of pickups in Texas.
Demand was up around the country and ""particularly strong"" in Houston, Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. Florida was off because of the lingering effects of Irma but ""was coming on strong at the end of the month.""
Galpin Motors President Beau Boeckmann told Reuters his dealerships experienced solid Labor Day sales ""but what was great was that we continued to see momentum throughout the month.""
Boeckmann said new Ford sales were up 28 percent in September, while Honda sales rose 20 percent. Galpin, with 11 dealer franchises in Southern California, is Ford's No. 1 U.S. dealer and Honda's No. 2.
Toyota Motor Corp's September sales increased nearly 15 percent, with strong gains for SUVs and trucks. Sales of the revamped 2018 midsize Camry sedan were up 13 percent in its first full month of sales. 
Honda Motor Co Ltd's September sales rose almost 7 percent, with its recently revamped midsize Accord sedan up nearly 10 percent. 
Toyota and Honda are betting the new sedans win market share as their Detroit rivals shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickups.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 10 percent decline in sales, driven by a 41 percent drop in lower-margin fleet sales. The company is cutting back on fleet sales. FCA's sales to consumers rose 0.3 percent.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd's September sales rose 9.5 percent. Judy Wheeler, vice president of U.S. sales, said while Houston area sales were up around 11 percent, results in most of its regions were also higher ""so it wasn't just the hurricanes that affected us.""
GM and Ford stocks helped boost U.S. indexes to new highs on Tuesday. (N) 

Since Harvey made landfall, GM stock has risen 24 percent, Ford is up 16 percent and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has rocketed 44 percent.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2017 01:40PM ET</span>",Brazil inflation likely grinds to near halt in September,"By Bruno Federowski
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian inflation likely slowed to a near halt in September, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Tuesday, further bolstering bets that the government will undershoot its target range in 2017 for the first time ever.
Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index probably rose 0.09 percent from August, according to the median of 32 forecasts in the poll, down from a 0.19 percent increase the month before. 
Economists seem more confident about a sharp slowdown in inflation now that seven of the last eight bi-weekly inflation readings have come in below their forecasts. Estimates this time ranged between 0.03 percent and 0.15 percent, a much narrower gap than usual.
The index likely rose 2.47 percent from the year before, barely changed from August's 2.46 percent increase, the poll showed. The data will be released on Friday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT).
A surprisingly strong decline in food prices, due to a record agricultural harvest, has contributed to driving inflation from double digits in early 2016 to a 19-year low.
Signs that the Brazilian economy is picking up steam after emerging from its worst recession in a century have yet to generate substantial price pressures. Off-the-books jobs accounted for most employment gains, while companies are still struggling to fill idle capacity.
""Despite the economic recovery being on track, there is still a lot of spare capacity in the economy,"" UBS economists wrote in a report.
An unexpected source of downward pressure on the September inflation figures came from electricity prices, which saw some relief as rains boosted hydroelectric power generation. Regulators hiked power rates in October and are expected to keep them high in coming months as the weather has once again turned dry.
Still, it may not be enough to lift inflation back to the government's target range of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, by year-end. The central bank has missed its inflation target three times in the last two decades, but has never undershot it.
That could prompt the central bank to cut interest rates below 7 percent by year-end, providing additional support to Latin America's largest economy, economists said.
Interest-rate future markets currently indicate most traders expect the benchmark Selic rate to fall as low as 7 percent, an all-time low, but bets on an even sharper decline have been growing.

Central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn said on Monday the bank expects to cut rates at a moderate pace if current conditions hold.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2017 11:11AM ET</span>","NRF sees holiday sales up 3.6-4 percent, slightly below 2016's growth","(Reuters) - U.S. holiday sales will increase 3.6 percent to 4 percent, getting a boost from an extra selling day and rising consumer confidence, according to a forecast from a leading retail industry group.
The guidance range, however, tipped slightly lower than last year's holiday season sales growth of 4 percent.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecast sales for the last two months of the year between $678.75 billion and $682 billion, excluding autos, gasoline and dining out.
""While recent hurricanes are not expected to have a significant long-term effect on the economy, NRF is issuing this year’s forecast as a range rather than the usual fixed percentage because the impact of the storms on economic indicators has made it difficult to make a more precise forecast,"" the industry body said in a statement.
NRF's forecast is one of the most closely watched benchmarks ahead of the holiday season, which can account for 20 percent to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.
Christmas falls 32 days after Thanksgiving this year, one extra day than last year, and is on a Monday instead of Sunday, giving consumers a full weekend to complete their shopping, the industry body said in its report.
U.S. consumer confidence has also been strengthening over this past year, due to a labor market that is churning out jobs, rising home prices and stock markets that are hovering at record highs. 
Non-store sales, which include online sales and those from kiosks, are expected to rise 11 to 15 percent to about $140 billion, the NRF said. In 2016, those sales rose 12.6 percent. 
NRF's forecast on Tuesday follows estimates from firms including, Deloitte and AlixPartners, which anticipate holiday season sales growth between 3.8 percent and 4.5 percent, due to higher online spending and a tightening job market. 
Big U.S. retail stocks, including Macy's Inc (N:M) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), were down marginally in early trading on Wall Street, in contrast with the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD), which was up 0.2 percent.

Market research firm Markit said that its U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.1 last month from a reading of 51.1 in August. Economists had expected the index to dip to 51.0 in September.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
September data revealed a difficult month for the U.K. construction sector, as a sustained drop in new work led to the first reduction in overall business activity since August 2016.
Survey respondents attributed the drop in workloads to fragile confidence and subdued risk appetite among clients, especially in the commercial building sector.
Commenting on the report, Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit and author of the report, said, "" Aside from the soft patch linked to spending delays around the EU referendum, construction companies have now experienced their longest period of falling workloads since early-2013.""

1475,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2017 11:24PM ET</span>","Reserve Bank of Australia Holds At 1.50%, Signals Improved Economy","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday held its cash rate steady at a record low 1.50% as expected and signaled to markets that the economy continues to improve.
For the full-text statement, see:
Number2017-21Date3 October 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy have improved. Labour markets have tightened and above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. Growth in the Chinese economy is being supported by increased spending on infrastructure and property construction, with the high level of debt continuing to present a medium-term risk. Australia's terms of trade are expected to decline in the period ahead but remain at relatively high levels.
Wage growth remains low in most countries, as does core inflation. Headline inflation rates are generally lower than at the start of the year, largely reflecting the earlier decline in oil prices. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will begin the process of balance sheet normalisation in October and that it expects to increase interest rates further. In the other major economies, there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing. Financial markets have been functioning effectively and volatility remains low.
The Australian economy expanded by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter. This outcome and other recent data are consistent with the Bank's expectation that growth in the Australian economy will gradually pick up over the coming year.
Over recent months there have been more consistent signs that non-mining business investment is picking up. A consolidation of this trend would be a welcome development. Business conditions as reported in surveys are at a high level and capacity utilisation has risen. A large pipeline of infrastructure investment is also supporting the outlook. Against this, slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt are likely to constrain growth in household spending.
Employment has continued to grow strongly over recent months. Employment has increased in all states and has been accompanied by a rise in labour force participation. The various forward-looking indicators point to solid growth in employment over the period ahead, although the unemployment rate is expected to decline only gradually over the next couple of years.
Wage growth remains low. This is likely to continue for a while yet, although the stronger conditions in the labour market should see some lift in wage growth over time. Inflation also remains low and is expected to pick up gradually as the economy strengthens.
The Australian dollar has appreciated since mid year, partly reflecting a lower US dollar. The higher exchange rate is expected to contribute to continued subdued price pressures in the economy. It is also weighing on the outlook for output and employment. An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.
Growth in housing debt has been outpacing the slow growth in household incomes for some time. To address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness, APRA has introduced a number of supervisory measures. Following some tightening in credit conditions, growth in borrowing by investors has slowed a little recently. In the housing market, conditions continue to vary considerably around the country. Housing prices have been rising briskly in some markets, while in others they have been declining. In Sydney, where prices have increased significantly, there have been further signs that conditions are easing. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Rent increases remain low in most cities.
The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' inflation expectations eased slightly in September from three months ago in a worrying sign the economy continues to struggle with a deflationary mindset.
Companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan expect consumer prices to rise 0.7 percent a year from now, lower than their projection for a 0.8 percent increase three months ago.
Firms also expect consumer prices to rise an annual 1.1 percent three years from now, unchanged from the previous survey.
Japan's economy has grown at a healthy pace this year, but consumer prices have eked out only small gains, which could hasten calls for the BOJ to either expand monetary easing or overhaul its approach to reflating the economy.
""Companies are more optimistic about overseas economies and don't expect domestic retail prices to rise that much,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""We won't see an immediate change in the BOJ's policy, but this does show that monetary easing will have to remain in place for a long time.""
The data come one day after the BOJ's tankan survey on corporate sentiment showed big manufactures are the most confident in a decade as global demand adds momentum to the economic recovery.
The tankan survey also showed companies expect the economy to lose a little momentum in the next three months.
Core consumer prices, which include oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.7 percent in August from a year earlier, marking the eighth straight month of gains but still well below the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.
One BOJ policymaker called for expanding monetary stimulus at a policy meeting in September, raising concerns that the board could become divided.
The central bank next meets on Oct. 30-31, where it will update its forecasts for consumer prices. A lowering of the forecasts would put pressure on the central bank to take further steps.

The BOJ started the survey on corporate price expectations from the tankan in March 2014 to gather more information on inflation expectations, key to its current stimulus programme.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2017 01:35PM ET</span>","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma lift U.S. factory activity index to 13-year high","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity surged to a near 13-1/2-year high in September as disruptions to the supply chains caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma resulted in factories taking longer to deliver goods and boosted raw material prices.
Still, details of the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey on Monday underscored the economy's underlying momentum, with factories reporting stronger order growth last month. A measure of factory employment hit its highest level since 2011.
""Much of the gain is presumably linked to the aftereffects of the hurricanes. Nonetheless, manufacturing growth is strong,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
ISM said its index of national factory activity surged to a reading of 60.8 last month, the highest reading since May 2004, from 58.8 in August. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
The ISM said Harvey and Irma had caused supply chain and pricing issues in the chemical products sector. There were also concerns about the disruptive impact of the storms on the food, beverage and tobacco products industries.
Manufacturers of nonmetallic mineral products said while the storms were boosting sales, they were also causing significant price increases on input raw materials. 
As a result, the ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index soared 7.3 points to 64.4 last month. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery time is normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index.
The survey's prices paid sub-index vaulted 9.5 points to 71.5, the highest reading since May 2011. 
Discounting the hurricanes' impact, the outlook for manufacturing remains bullish. Seventeen out of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth last month.
The ISM survey's production sub-index rose 1.2 points to a reading of 62.2 in September and a gauge of new orders jumped to 64.6 in September from 60.3 in August. 
LOW INVENTORIES
Factories also reported that customers' inventories remained at levels considered ""too low"" last month. The ISM said this was an indication that ""downstream customers continue to operate at a high level of demand that production cannot fully satisfy."" 
The ISM said its measure of factory employment increased 0.4 point to 60.3, the highest since June 2011.
U.S. financial markets viewed the data as supportive of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were largely unchanged. Stocks on Wall Street hovered near record highs.
""While this is survey sentiment data rather than harder manufacturing production data, it does indicate the economic expansion is very much intact despite the short-term disruptions due to the hurricanes,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.  
Harvey and Irma are expected to chop off as much as six-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product growth in the third quarter. Harvey, which pummeled Texas at the end of August, has undercut consumer spending and weighed on industrial production, homebuilding and home sales. 
Further weakness is likely after Irma struck Florida in early September, causing widespread power cuts. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.
In separate report on Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.5 percent as outlays for both private and public projects increased, ending two straight monthly declines. Construction spending advanced 2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis.
The government said Harvey and Irma did not appear to have impacted the construction spending data as the responses from the Texas and Florida areas affected by the storms were ""not significantly lower than normal.""

September data could, however, be impacted. According to the Commerce Department, Texas and Florida accounted for 22 percent of U.S. private nonresidential construction spending in 2016. They made up 15 percent of U.S. state-and-locally owned construction spending in 2016.

The Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index  rose to 52.8 in September from 52.2 in August, when adjusted for seasonal swings.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that points to contraction.
""The latest set of PMI data show that economic conditions in Mexico remained on an upward trajectory, with factory output expanding in tandem with strong inflows of new work,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
The report said that manufacturing conditions in Mexico continued to improve at the end of the third quarter. A marked and accelerated expansion in factory orders underpinned a robust upturn in output, as jobs were created over the month and firms purchased greater quantities of inputs.
Rising manufacturing activity likely helped boost gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter.
""Buoyant demand for Mexican goods was evident domestically and externally, while businesses spent more on staff and quantities of purchases. These are additional signs that GDP growth will probably accelerate from the modest 0.6 percent rise noted in Q2,"" said De Lima.
The September figure was the highest since May 2016, as output and new orders picked up. The PMI reading over the third quarter as a whole was the highest since the second quarter of 2016.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and TVs, to the United States.
Trade negotiators from Mexico, Canada and the United States wrapped up on Wednesday a five-day session of talks in Ottawa to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that progress had been made but acknowledging that much work remained to conclude the negotiations by the end of the year.

The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

The Purchasing Managers' Index <BRPMIM=ECI> compiled by research firm Markit held at a seasonally adjusted 50.9, the same as August's level. Readings above the 50 threshold indicate improving business conditions for manufacturers.
The report is the latest in a string of solid data highlighting growing momentum in Latin America's largest economy as it exits its deepest recession in more than a century, reinforcing the outlook for a gradual recovery.
""Momentum in the Brazilian manufacturing sector was maintained at the end of the third quarter,"" Markit economist Pollyanna De Lima said.
""Less encouraging were signs that manufacturers remain unwilling to hold inventories, suggesting that they’re not yet convinced of a sustained rise in underlying demand.""
Costs rose by the most in six months, driven mostly by an increase in fuel prices. Still, firms did not fully pass through that increase to consumers in a bid to remain competitive and attract further demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing growth cooled last month as cost pressures lurched higher, according to a survey that could put the Bank of England a step closer to raising interest rates, despite a murky outlook ahead of Brexit.
Monday's IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.9 from a downwardly revised 56.7 in August, undershooting the consensus of 56.4 in a Reuters poll of economists.
By contrast, euro zone factories had their best month since early 2011. 
While the PMI survey signaled solid expansion at British factories, helped by robust exports, softer growth in new orders and a slowdown among producers of investment goods raised concern about the months ahead.
Britain's economy initially withstood the shock of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union. But growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose following the pound's post-Brexit vote plunge, hitting households.
Against that background, the BoE surprised investors last month when its officials said they were likely to raise interest rates soon, citing a reduced tolerance for above-target inflation.
Analysts said Monday's survey - which showed a resurgence of price pressures - would do little to alter this judgment.
""While the weaker economic backdrop is unlikely to deter the Bank from hiking in November, it does mean that the chances of a series of rate hikes after that are low,"" said James Smith, economist at ING.
Costs paid by factories for goods shot up at the fastest pace since March, the PMI showed, spurred in part by an increase in commodity prices and capacity constraints in the supply chain.
""Emerging problems in the supply chain, signaled by lengthening lead times, are likely related to the subdued investment performance of the past few quarters,"" said Lee Hopley, economist at manufacturing association EEF.
IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said this would probably exert further upward pressure on prices, dent profitability and potentially disrupt production schedules in coming months - boosting the case for higher rates.
The PMI's gauge of British manufacturing export orders slowed for a second month. While still much stronger than its historical average, it lagged the euro zone's by some distance. 
A majority of economists polled by Reuters last week expect the BoE will raise interest rates in November, although most also thought it would be a mistake to hike now. 
Official economic growth figures published last week showed manufacturing output contracted 0.3 percent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter.

PMIs for the construction industry and all-important service sector are due to be published on Tuesday and Wednesday.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2017 05:26AM ET</span>",Asian factories rev up in September ahead of year-end spending spree,"By Shri Navaratnam
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Factories in Asia's largest economies cranked up activity in September as a synchronized upswing in growth globally pointed to solid consumption of manufactured goods heading into the lucrative end-of-year shopping season.
However, pockets of weakness in regional economies are likely to keep Asian central banks slanted toward more accommodative monetary policy, even as their Western counterparts move to scale back stimulus.
China's central bank on Saturday cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves for the first time since February 2016 in a bid to encourage more lending to struggling smaller firms and energize its lackluster private sector.
The world's second-largest economy has defied expectations for a slowdown this year, growing at a strong clip in the first half thanks to a construction boom. Beijing's latest easing comes ahead of a key party gathering this month. 
""It's a solid backdrop for manufacturing in the region as we head toward the big shopping season,"" said Rob Carnell, Asia's head of research at ING.
That sentiment was backed by an official Purchasing Managers' Index from China's vast manufacturing sector, which showed activity last month grew at the fastest clip since 2012 on solid demand.
But cost pressures from high raw materials prices and continued underperformance of smaller firms mean some manufacturers are still struggling, which was reflected in a separate private survey of Chinese factories showing growth slowed in September.
In Japan, factory activity grew the fastest in four months, thanks to robust exports growth and underpinned improving economic momentum even though inflation remained tepid. Meanwhile, a closely watched Bank of Japan survey showed big manufacturers have more confidence in business conditions than they have had for a decade, thanks to a weaker yen and robust global demand.
In South Korea, manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost two years.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, also showed an improvement in factory growth but the pace was tepid and production contracted slightly. Indonesia has cut interest rates twice this year in a bid to boost stubbornly weak domestic consumption, while India slashed rates once in August to spur growth and inflation.
Those moves, along with the BOJ's commitment to maintain its ultra-low rates for the foreseeable future, marked a contrast to the West's shift toward tighter policy, although analysts expect the extent of stimulus in Asia to be measured. 
""I would characterize some of the easings (in Asia) as a bit of fine-tuning really and not a major divergence in policy with the West,"" ING's Carnell said. 
""The regional economies continue to grow at a decent pace.""
GLOBAL UPSWING
Indeed, a synchronized upswing in the global economy has been a boon to manufacturers from China to Britain and the United States, with export-reliant Asia enjoying a spurt in growth led by an upsurge in sales of electronics.
A raft of European PMIs scheduled for publication later on Monday are expected to paint a picture of robust manufacturing momentum globally.
Shipments from Japan and South Korea - two major exporters - remained robust with the boom helping their economies grow at a decent clip. In Taiwan, another export-bellwether, factories continued to expand at a steady pace on higher global demand.
In South Korea, higher memory chip and steel product sales lifted exports by 35 percent year-on-year in the longest stretch of expansion since 2011.
Full-year growth in China is widely expected to handily meet the government's target of 6.5 percent, after stronger-than-forecast growth of 6.9 percent in the first half, driven by a year-long building boom and solid exports.
That augured well for Asia's manufacturers for the rest of the year.
""Looking ahead, we expect conditions in the region’s manufacturing sectors to remain fairly healthy over the coming months, helped by a combination of loose domestic monetary policy as well as firmer global growth,"" said Shilan Shah, economist at Capital Economics.
And given price pressures are largely contained in places like China and Japan as well as smaller economies including Singapore and Indonesia, policymakers will have headroom to boost stimulus if the need arises.
""The big picture is that inflation in most of these economies is set to stay benign, giving their central banks scope to keep interest rates low to support growth,"" Shah said.

Market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 55.9 last month from a reading of 56.9 in August. Analysts had expected the index to inch down to 56.4 in September.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Production and new orders both rose at above long-run average rates. However, the latest survey signaled that cost inflationary pressures surged higher. This reflected a combination of rising commodity prices, the exchange rate and increased supply-chain pressures.
Commenting on the report, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said, “Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader U.K. economy.""
Data released last week showed Britain's economy grew at its slowest pace since 2013 in the 12 months after last year's Brexit vote, painting a subdued picture as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
The BoE said in September that it was likely to raise borrowing costs in the months ahead if the economy and price pressures kept growing.
GBP/USD was trading at 1.3311 from around 1.3318 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8820 from 0.8825 earlier.

Construction activity fell 49.2 percent in the quarter, with 1.63 million square feet of new construction completed, the lowest level of completions since 2014, according to the report.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big manufacturers have more confidence in Japan's business conditions than they have had for a decade as a weak yen and robust global demand add momentum to the economic recovery, a closely watched central bank survey showed on Monday.
In a sign the recovery was broadening, small manufacturers' business confidence also hit a decade-high and the ratio of companies complaining of labor shortages was at a 25-year high, according to the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" quarterly survey.
The upbeat data could help premier Shinzo Abe as he tries to convince voters in an Oct. 22 election that his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have improved their livelihoods.
It also supports Bank of Japan (BOJ) policymakers' hopes that a sustained economic recovery will boost wages and household spending, though many analysts expect inflation to remain distant from the central bank's 2 percent target.
""Big manufacturers' sentiment was probably driven by a weaker yen and hefty corporate profits,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities Japan.
""The tankan results were in line with or even stronger than the BOJ's scenario. But the price trend remains weak,"" he said, adding he expects the central bank to cut its inflation forecasts again at a rate review this month.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 22 in September, handily exceeding a median market forecast of plus 18 to mark the highest level since September 2007.
It was higher than plus 17 seen in the previous survey in June, posting a fourth straight quarter of improvement, the tankan survey showed.
The big non-manufacturers' sentiment index stood at plus 23, unchanged from June and matching a median market forecast.Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to deteriorate in the next three months, the survey found, reflecting their concerns about uncertain outlook.
But big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 7.7 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March 2018, roughly unchanged from their plans in June.
""The tankan shows that capital expenditure plans are on solid footing,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities. ""A lot of firms are upgrading equipment or investing in labor-saving technology.""
WEAK PRICES
The survey will be among data the BOJ board will scrutinize when it issues fresh long-term economic and price forecasts at a rate review on Oct. 30-31.
With inflation stubbornly low, some central bankers fret the BOJ may need to slash its price forecasts for the year ending in March 2018, say sources familiar with its thinking.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter on robust consumer and corporate spending, heightening hopes of a sustained recovery.
While slowing down from the second quarter's exceptionally fast growth, the economy is likely to have expanded 1.1 percent in the July-September period, according to a Reuters poll.
A separate survey showed Japanese manufacturing activity in September expanded at the fastest pace in four months, as domestic and export orders picked up.
But price and wage growth remain weak with firms still wary of passing more of their profits to employees, forcing the BOJ to push back the timing for reaching its price target six times since deploying a massive stimulus program in 2013.
The BOJ now expects inflation to hit 2 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, arguing that a tightening job market and solid economic growth will gradually push up prices.
An index gauging firms' views of the job market showed that those complaining of labor shortages, rather than excess staff, were at the highest since 1992, the tankan showed.
Japan's jobless rate stood at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August, reflecting a strengthening economy and shrinking working-age population in a rapidly aging society.
Wary of increasing fixed costs, many firms make up for the shortage by hiring more temporary workers instead of raising salaries for their higher-earning permanent employees - a trend that has kept overall wage growth subdued.
""The economy is doing well. But our labor force is shrinking, so the shortage of workers that companies experience will get worse,"" said Miyagawa at Mizuho Securities.

""Companies know that wages aren't rising that much, so they are reluctant to raise prices. In this situation, the BOJ cannot exit from quantitative easing.""

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 52.9, versus a preliminary 52.6 and a final 52.2 in August.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 13th consecutive month and reached the highest level since May.
""September data signaled further improvement to the Japanese manufacturing sector, led by strong increases in output and new orders,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Stronger international client demand provided a key source of growth, as shown by export sales expanding at the quickest pace in seven months.""
The final index for new export orders rose to 53.5, more than the preliminary reading of 53.1 and above a final 51.3 in the previous month, highlighting how Japan's economy has benefited from an upturn in global demand this year. 
That was underscored further by the new orders index rising to 53.4, versus a preliminary 52.5 and more than the 51.9 in August.
The PMI survey follows recent government data showing rising exports, industrial production and a mild rebound in consumer spending, raising confidence the economy will continue to grow at a health clip.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar's economic growth slowed in the second quarter to its lowest rate since the global financial crisis because of a sagging oil sector, while sanctions by other Arab states inflicted minor damage, official data showed on Sunday.
Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, expanded just 0.6 percent from a year earlier in the April-June period, the slowest growth since the 2009-2010 crisis. GDP grew 0.5 percent from the previous quarter.
The main reason for the slowdown was the mining and quarrying sector, which includes oil and gas output; it shrank 2.7 percent from a year ago. Last December, Qatar and other global oil producers agreed to cut output to support prices.
The non-oil part of the economy grew 3.9 percent from a year earlier in April-June, slowing from 4.9 percent growth in the first quarter, and was flat compared with the previous quarter. That suggested the sanctions were having an impact, but not enough to push Qatar into recession.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism, which Doha denies.
The sanctions temporarily disrupted many imports into Qatar by closing its border with Saudi Arabia, and by forcing shipping lines to establish new routes to offset their loss of Dubai as a trans-shipment center.
The second-quarter figures suggested this disruption was not crippling for the economy, however. Manufacturing output was flat from a year earlier and grew 1.2 percent from the previous quarter.
The construction sector expanded 15.3 percent from a year ago although it shrank 4.1 percent from the previous quarter, indicating that while some projects may have been slowed by temporary shortages of materials, Qatar's building boom continues.
Other data released for individual months in the third quarter indicate the impact of the sanctions is fading. Imports into Qatar rebounded in August, and the government said on Saturday that July manufacturing output rose 2.7 percent year-on-year and 4.5 percent month-on-month.

Manufacturing of food products soared 39.8 percent from a year ago and rose 9.8 percent from the previous month in July as Qatar, which previously relied heavily on food imports across the Saudi border, sought to become more self-sufficient in food processing.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies slipped to +11, down from +14 for the three months to August.
""Growth in the economy has held steady through the summer, although at a slightly slower pace than expected by many firms,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said. 
The expansion eased in factories and fizzled out in business and professional services firms, the CBI said. Distribution was the only sector to experience faster growth, following a strong performance from retailers.
Despite the mixed readings, overall output expectations for the next three months edged up to +18, up two points from August.
The CBI survey is unlikely to sway Bank of England rate-setters who have said interest rates are likely to rise soon, as long as the economy continues growing and prices keep rising.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace since 2012 in September as factories cranked up output to take advantage of strong demand and high prices, easing worries of a slowdown before a key political meeting next month.
Production, total new orders and output prices all improved to the highest level in at least a year, while a pick-up in a reading for the construction sector indicated a building boom is undiminished.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Saturday rose to 52.4 in September, from 51.7 in August and well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
It marked the 14th straight month of expansion for China's massive manufacturing industry and the highest reading since April 2012. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would ease slightly.
The data comes ahead of the Communist Party Congress in mid-October, a once-every-five-years meeting where new leaders are appointed and the government's key political and economic initiatives are laid out, though details are usually not announced until much later.
China's manufacturers are reporting their best profits in years, fueled by government-led infrastructure spending, a strong housing market, higher factory-gate prices and a recovery in exports.
""Over the short term, we believe the resilient demand growth and disciplined balance sheet expansion ... will point to further improvement in manufacturing profitability and investment returns,"" analysts at China International Capital Corporation said in a note after the data.
But cost pressures from high raw materials prices and continued underperformance of smaller firms mean some manufacturers are still struggling.
""Mid- and downstream industries are worried about a further increase in cost pressures,"" National Bureau of Statistics official Zhao Qinghe wrote in comments published with the data.
INPUT PRICES CLIMB
The latest survey showed input prices continued to rise at a solid clip, with the reading at 68.4 compared with 65.3 in August, benefiting upstream producers such as miners, smelters and oil refiners.
Indexes for raw materials prices in the paper, wood processing and furniture, and chemical products manufacturing industries were all above 75.0, said Zhao, indicating large price increases.
Output prices also rose but at a slower pace, pointing to lower profit margins for companies further along the supply chain who are unable to pass on all of the price increases to their customers.
A separate PMI on the steel industry fell to 53.7 in September from 57.2 in August but remained in solid expansion territory, as the industry faces production restrictions aimed at reducing choking air pollution over the winter.
Analysts at China Merchants Securities said stricter production limits related to efforts to improve air quality and supply-side adjustments from capacity cuts had helped to improve the supply-demand balance, with new orders rising faster than production in September for the first time since 2012.
For the manufacturing sector overall, inventories of raw materials and finished goods continued to decline in September, providing little indication that factories were stocking up in preparation for winter production cuts.
Big firms saw the strongest improvement in September, with a large firms sub-index rising to 53.8, while one for small firms improved slightly but was still in contraction territory at 49.4.
China's cabinet on Wednesday said that China will take a number of measures, including tax exemptions and targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts, to encourage banks to support small businesses.
The impressive performance for China's manufacturers comes despite a government push to shutter outdated industrial capacity and clean up polluting industries, though some analysts say official claims of massive capacity cuts are misleading as overall production is still rising.
Chinese authorities are also in the midst of a campaign to reduce the risks from a rapid build-up in debt produced by years of credit-fuelled stimulus, and the continued strength of the industrial sector could give policymakers confidence to stick to the push for deleveraging.
PRIVATE SURVEY SHOWS SLOWER GROWTH
A separate private survey may temper some of the enthusiasm, as it showed growth slowed in September amid high pricing pressure and slower new order growth.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.0 in September, compared with 51.6 in August, as new export order growth slipped.
So far, the regulatory clampdown has focused on the financial sector, particularly interbank and shadow banking activity, and the pass-through to the real economy appears to be limited.
But S&P last week downgraded China's sovereign credit rating, saying the government's deleveraging drive has progressed slower than expected, leading to higher economic and financial risks.
An official survey on the services sector published Saturday rose at the fastest pace since 2014, though gains in that sector were also driven by higher input prices.
A sub-reading for the construction sector rose to 61.1 in September from 58.0 in August.

The official data showed firms in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to shed workers.

So far this year, inflation has exceeded the central bank's year-end forecast of 9.1 percent as domestic food prices have risen due to a poor harvest. Increased meat exports has further pressured prices.
A current seasonal increase in vegetable supply may help to reverse year-on-year inflation, which has accelerated every month since May.
Although inflation is seen easing, most analysts at Ukrainian banks and brokerages suggest it is too early to expect any monetary policy softening.
Nine among 13 analysts believe the central bank will keep its key interest rate at 12.5 percent at its next policy review on Oct. 26.
The central has not changed the rate since May when it cut it to 12.5 percent from 13 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August likely as Hurricane Harvey weighed on auto sales and annual inflation increased at its slowest pace since late 2015, pointing to a moderation in economic growth in the third quarter.
The weak report from the Commerce Department on Friday did little to change expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December. Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday the Fed needed to continue gradual rate hikes despite uncertainty about the path of inflation. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent last month also as unseasonably mild temperatures in some parts of the country reduced demand for utilities. That followed an unrevised 0.3 percent increase in July.
August's gain in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending slipped 0.1 percent in August, the first drop since January. 
The government said the data reflected the effects of Hurricane Harvey. However, it could not separately quantify the total impact of Harvey on the data. It said it made adjustments to estimates where source data were not yet available or did not fully reflect the effects of the storm.
The dollar fell to a session low against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
The report was the latest suggestion that Harvey, together with Hurricane Irma, would dent economic growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a brisk 3.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, with consumers doing the heavy lifting. 
Harvey, which tore through Texas in late August, has undercut industrial production, homebuilding and home sales. Further declines are expected after Irma slammed Florida in early September. 
Economists estimate the storms could slice off as much as six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth. However, a pick-up in output is expected in the fourth quarter as communities ravaged by the hurricanes rebuild.
TAME INFLATION
Inflation remained benign in August, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rising 0.1 percent. The so-called core PCE has advanced by the same margin for four straight months.
As a result, the annual increase in the core PCE price index slowed to 1.3 percent in August after advancing 1.4 percent in July. That was the smallest year-on-year increase since November 2015. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and has a 2 percent target. 
The U.S. central bank signaled last week it anticipated one more interest rate increase by the end of the year. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year. Financial markets were pricing a roughly 71 percent probability of an interest rate hike in December, compared with 76 percent earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
Consumer spending last month was held back by a 1.1 percent decline in outlays on long-lasting goods. The Commerce Department said spending on new motor vehicles was the leading contributor to the drop in the so-called durable goods. 
Auto manufacturers reported that Hurricane Harvey had impacted on sales in the last week of August. 
Harvey also probably impacted on income in August.
Personal income rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in July. Wages were unchanged after increasing 0.5 percent in July. 

Savings fell to $522.9 billion in August, the lowest level since December 2016, from $524.8 billion in the prior month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew at its slowest pace since 2013 in the 12 months after last year's Brexit vote, data showed on Friday, painting a subdued picture as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
The world's fifth-biggest economy was just 1.5 percent bigger than a year earlier in the second quarter, the weakest year-on-year expansion in more than four years and down from a rate of 1.8 percent in the first three months of the year.
Britain's Office for National Statistics had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 1.7 percent, and none of the economists polled by Reuters before the data had expected such a big downward revision.
Friday's data also showed a monthly fall in output for the services sector in July, boding poorly for third-quarter growth.
Sterling fell after the data and prompted some economists to reconsider their prediction of a rate hike at the end of the BoE's next meeting on Nov. 2.
""I'm sticking to my call for a hike in November, but I'm much more nervous now than I was prior to this data release,"" Scotiabank's Alan Clarke wrote in a note to clients.
However, the weak data might not stand in the way of the BoE raising interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Friday the economy was on track for a rate hike ""in the relatively near term"", two weeks after the BoE jolted markets by flagging a rate rise ""in the coming months,"" despite weak growth this year.
The BoE has downgraded its estimate of how fast Britain's economy can grow without generating excess inflation because of the impact of Brexit, so Friday's weaker growth picture is not necessarily fatal for the chances of a November rate rise.
REVISING THE PAST
A major annual set of revisions of Britain's official data showed show stronger business investment, net exports and household savings, but also a larger current account deficit.
Britain sucked in 23.2 billion pounds ($31.0 billion) of foreign finance in the three months to June, far above economists' 16 billion pound forecast, and the first-quarter deficit was revised up to 22.3 billion pounds from 16.9 billion.
Business investment grew by an annual 2.5 percent in the second quarter, compared with an earlier estimate that it had stagnated, and households' savings ratio was a relatively healthy 5.4 percent in the second quarter.
Net exports contributed 0.4 percentage points to quarterly growth, compared with earlier estimates of zero, and an inflationary squeeze on consumers may be easing, with real household disposable income up 1.6 percent in the latest quarter, the most since 2015.
Nonetheless, the broader picture remains one of consumers under pressure from a steep rise in inflation caused by the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote.
Disposable income has fallen year-on-year for the last four quarters, the longest period since 2011.
Overall quarterly GDP growth was unrevised at 0.3 percent, and the services sector - which makes up 80 percent on the economy - contracted by 0.2 percent in July.
Separately, mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices - a bellwether for consumer demand - rose at their slowest rate in four years this month, and the Bank of England said mortgage approvals fell in August.
""It would be unprecedented for the central bank to tighten policy with the data pointing to such anemic economic growth,"" Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data company IHS Markit, said.
""However, policymakers continue to fuel expectations that interest rates will rise soon in response to higher-than-expected inflation,"" he said.

Hong Kong private home prices climbed 10.3 percent during January-August this year, and soared 18 percent from the year-ago period, data compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department showed.
The prices rose 0.44 percent in August, compared with July's 0.33 percent increase that reflected the slowest pace of growth in 17 months, data showed.
The head of the city's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, struck a note of caution against homebuyers piling into the market. 
""The risk of the property market overheating still exists,"" Norman Chan, head of HKMA, told reporters.
""Right now we are at a very abnormal state with very low interest rates,"" Chan said, adding that people should be prudent because their mortgage rates could rise if interest rates increase in the future.
The HKMA has introduced eight rounds of mortgage tightening measures since 2009 in hopes of cooling the red-hot housing market, but some homebuyers desperate to buy a flat before prices soar even more have instead turned to shadow lenders. [nL4N1JY46G]
The HKMA wrote in its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report on Thursday that home prices showed ""signs of moderation"" following the last round of measures announced in May, but said the residential property market outlook ""remains highly uncertain"" looking ahead.
Taming soaring home prices in the Asian financial hub is the top priority for the city's new leader Carrie Lam, who is expected to address the issue in her maiden Policy Address next month.
Home ownership can be a distant dream for many in Hong Kong, one of the most expensive housing markets in the world, where a flat of less than 200 square feet can cost as much as $500,000.

While the government focuses on increasing land and primary housing supply, analysts say tightening measures such as high stamp duties have effectively locked up the supply in the secondary housing market.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's jobless rate fell to a new record low in September and the number of unemployed people fell far more than expected but retail sales disappointed, sending mixed signals about the state of Europe's largest economy.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent, the lowest level since reunification in 1990, after 5.7 percent in August, data on Friday from the Federal Labour Office showed. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to hold steady.
The jobless total fell by 23,000 to 2.506 million in seasonally adjusted terms. That compared with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a fall of 5,000 and was a steeper drop than that projected by even the most optimistic economist, who had expected a fall of 15,000.
""The economic cycle in Germany is moving toward its peak stage and that's giving the labor market a further boost,"" said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at state development bank KfW.
An economic upturn in Europe has boosted exports and corporate investment, suggesting further rises in employment and noticeable wage rises - including beyond 2017, he said. But he added there were risks for the economy, with a further strong appreciation of the euro chief among them.
That could potentially hurt exporters in an economy traditionally propelled by exports but more recently driven by consumers who are benefiting from record employment, increased job security, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs.
Other data published on Friday showed retail sales unexpectedly fell on the month in August and posted a smaller increase on the year than forecast, putting a slight dampener on hopes that a consumer-led upswing will continue at full steam.
The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, showed retail sales decreased by 0.4 percent on the month in real terms. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.5 percent rise and followed a 1.2 percent drop in July.
On the year, retail sales jumped by 2.8 percent, matching the previous month's increase but undershooting a Reuters consensus forecast for an increase of 3.2 percent.
Adding to the mixed picture, a GfK survey published on Thursday showed the cheerful mood among German shoppers had clouded unexpectedly heading into October.

Nonetheless, the outlook for the economy remains bright overall. Institutes on Thursday hiked their growth forecasts to 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent next year, while also saying Germany would have record budget surpluses over the next two years.

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation miss supports case for ECB caution,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation undershot expectations in September, Eurostat data showed on Friday, highlighting that price growth remained week and supporting the European Central Bank's case for only gradual removal of stimulus.
Inflation in the 19-member currency bloc held steady at 1.5 percent this month, missing expectations for 1.6 percent and trending well below the ECB's target of almost 2 percent. 
With inflation heading lower in the coming months, likely bottoming out below 1 percent early next year, the ECB is in a difficult spot: strong economic growth would warrant policy tightening but weak consumer prices call for continued stimulus.
The likely compromise is a small reduction in asset buys from next year, accompanied by a pledge to keep monetary policy easy for even longer. 
Indeed, the ECB is due to decide in late October on policy for next year with rate setters pointing to recalibration. This suggested that only small changes are coming and the bank will may not even point to the eventual end of asset buys.
Underlying inflation, holding steady at 1.3 percent last month, is also a worry for policymakers as there is hardly any price pressure in the pipeline.
The ECB expects inflation to drop possibly as low at 0.8 percent in early next year, mostly on base effect, before rising to 1.4 percent by the end of the year, its projections show.
The ECB's problem is that while the bloc has created over 7 million jobs since the worst days of its crisis, slack in the labor market remains large, keeping a lid on wages and ultimately inflation.
The euro's 12 percent rise against the dollar could also pull down prices, particularly for imported industrial goods, which could then feed into core inflation, or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices.
Looking to keep borrowing costs low and encourage spending, the ECB has bought over 2 trillion euros worth of bonds in the past two and a half years, mirroring similar asset buying schemes by the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan.
But inflation has responded slower than policymakers had hoped even just a few months ago indicating that the bank has either lost some control over inflation or that hidden slack in the economy is bigger than thought. 
The bank has undershot its target for nearly five years and expects to miss at least until the end of the decade. Markets are even more pessimistic with longer-term forecasts suggesting a miss well into the next decade.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>","In work, but out of pocket","By Jeremy Gaunt
LONDON (Reuters) - Unemployment in the world's biggest developed economies has been falling, at least since the end of the financial crisis. But wages, in the main, have not reacted as might be expected.
They have generally either grown only modestly, or even fallen. 
Take, for example, resurgent Germany. Since 2012, the unemployment rate has tumbled to the lowest level since reunification. Wages and salaries have grown -- but only gradually and at nothing like a rate to imply pressure.
It is even clearer in Japan, where unemployment this year has fallen to a more than 20-year low of just 2.8 percent 
""Everything tells us the labor market is tight in Japan,"" said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. ""(But) the one place we are not seeing labor market tightness in is wages, which aren't rising at all.""
One impact of this globally is that inflation has not picked up much despite the massive amount of stimulus hurled at it by central banks, including negligible or even negative interest rates. Indeed, it may be one reason why some banks appear to be less worried about low inflation than they were.
For the worker, the lack of inflation has masked some of the wage stagnation. (It has only become a hot issue in Britain, for example, since inflation took off after the Brexit vote.)
But this may not last. September's GfK sentiment index suggested German consumer morale may be about to cool as a result of a more negative expectation for incomes. 
The more-workers-less-pay-growth phenomenon, meanwhile, is the subject of a new report from International Monetary Fund economists Gee Hee Hong, Zsoka Koczan, Weicheng Lian and Malhar Nabar.
They find the disconnect between unemployment and wages to be the result of a number of factors -- including the slowdown of productivity -- that are relatively new and which are probably not going to go away.
A key factor is an abundant workforce -- labor market slack in the jargon. But that is a seeming contradiction given the record low unemployment rates in some places.
It comes down to people working fewer hours than they would like and the trend toward temporary contracts -- the gig economy, zero-hours contracts and so on.
That leaves a large number of workers for companies to choose from if wage demands rise.
""Despite employment growth, hours per worker have continued to decline and involuntary part-time employment has increased in more than two-thirds of countries,"" the IMF report notes.
A second factor is, in effect, the impact of globalization and a more integrated global economy. 
Local labor slack is essentially only part of the picture.
""(Playing a possible role are) the threat of plant relocation across borders, or an increase in the effective worldwide supply of labor,"" the economists found.
Interestingly, a third factor -- automation -- was not found by the IMF team to have had a major impact, at least yet.
That may come later. In March, PwC consultants estimated that by 2030 automation will impact -- do away with or change -- 38 percent of existing jobs in the United States, 35 percent in Germany, 30 in Britain, and 21 in Japan.
Sounds a long time away, but it is just over 12 years.
ITALY NEXT
The political impact of all this is unknown -- although Britain's Brexit vote, the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, and the rise of the far-right AfD in Germany all point at the very least to voter disenchantment with the status quo.
So the next big test could be Italy, where unemployment is a stubborn 11.4 percent and wage growth has been running at negligible year-on-year rates.
Italy will have to hold a general election by the end of May next year and an economy deemed to be weak or unequal could boost support for parties that at the very least have been critical of the euro.
Among them are the 5-Star Movement, the Northern League and even former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. Berlusconi recently raised the idea of a parallel currency to the euro.
The coming week will give a snapshot of Italy's economy, with September's purchasing manager indexes (PMI) and the unemployment rate for August. There will also be retail sales data -- sometimes a test of voter contentment.

Meanwhile, there will be a global economic snapshot for the end of the third quarter, from PMI across the globe to U.S. payrolls.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core inflation accelerated in August, industrial output rose more than expected and demand for labor remained at its strongest in over 40 years in a further sign of solid momentum in the world's third-largest economy.
The flurry of data should bolster optimism about the outlook for growth, though Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision to call a snap election has raised some uncertainty over economic policy.
There was also some uneasiness about monetary policy after a summary of the Bank of Japan's most recent meeting showed one board member wanted an expansion of stimulus as consumer prices remain distant from the central bank's 2 percent inflation target. 
Nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.7 percent, matching a median market forecast. It was the eighth straight month of gains in the index, and followed a 0.5 percent rise in July.
""Prices are rising gradually. Exports are supporting output and domestic demand doesn't look too bad,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""As long as Abe remains in power, we will see a continuation of his policies, but it all depends on the election.""
Indeed, demand for labor remains at the strongest level since 1974 with data showing the jobs-applicants ratio held steady at 1.52 in August. 
Industrial output also rose a larger-than-expected 2.1 percent in August from the previous month as manufacturers of construction equipment, autos, and electronic parts produced more goods.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall 1.9 percent in September and then expand by 3.5 percent in October. 
Politics, however, added a layer of uncertainty over the outlook for growth, with inflation still well behind the BOJ's target.
Abe on Thursday dissolved the lower house and called a snap election for Oct. 22. Initially, his ruling coalition looked certain to retain its majority.
However, the outcome has been thrown into doubt because the largest opposition party has abandoned the election and will allow its members to run for a newly formed party that may be more popular with voters.
The summary of the BOJ's rate review this month did not identify who spoke or what specific measures were proposed.
However, the central bank's announcement after its Sept. 20-21 meeting showed board newcomer Goushi Kataoka, a vocal advocate of aggressive easing, dissented to the BOJ's decision to leave policy unchanged, saying it is insufficient to meet the 2 percent inflation target.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and company spending picked up.
But price and wage growth remain weak with firms still wary of passing more of their profits to employees, forcing the BOJ to push back the timing for reaching its price target six times since deploying a massive stimulus program in 2013.
The BOJ now expects inflation to hit 2 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, arguing that a tightening job market and solid economic growth will gradually push up prices. 
Friday's data also showed core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were up 0.5 percent in September from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast.
Household spending rose 0.6 percent in August from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms, but this was below the median estimate of a 1.0 percent increase and suggests that consumer spending is slowing slightly after a strong performance in April-June quarter.
""I'm not pessimistic on consumption,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.

""The labor market is tight and disposable income is rising. Consumer spending can remain on firm footing.""

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2017 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. economy accelerates in second quarter; hurricanes expected to slow growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded a bit faster than previously estimated in the second quarter, recording its quickest rate of growth in more than two years, but the momentum likely slowed in the third quarter due to the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate on Thursday. The upward revision from the 3.0 percent rate of growth reported last month reflected a rise in inventory investment.
""The destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the resulting disruption ... are expected to be a drag on third-quarter growth,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""Nonetheless, the economy remains on track.""
Economic growth last quarter was the quickest since the first quarter of 2015 and followed a 1.2 percent pace in the January-March period. Economists estimate that Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida, could cut as much as six-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter.
Harvey was blamed for much of the decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales in August. Further weakness is anticipated in September because of Irma.
Rebuilding efforts are, however, expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018. Signs of increasing inventory investment by businesses could soften the storms' punch to the economy. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories jumped 1.0 percent in August after rising 0.6 percent in July. Inventories at retailers shot up 0.7 percent after being unchanged in July. The department also said the goods trade deficit fell 1.4 percent to $62.9 billion in August.
That leaves an upside risk to growth estimates for the July-September quarter, which are below 2.5 percent.
""The data available so far suggest that the firming in real inventory accumulation between second quarter and third quarter could be significant and could add over a full percentage point to growth in the third quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Harvey and Irma continue to impact the labor market and are expected to cut into job growth this month. In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 272,000 for the week ended Sept. 23. 
Still, the labor market remains strong. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 134 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
Economists had expected that the second-quarter GDP growth rate would be unrevised at 3.0 percent.
Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading lower and the dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
With GDP accelerating in the second quarter, the economy grew 2.1 percent in the first half of 2017. Even so, economists believe growth this year will fall short of President Donald Trump's ambitious 3.0 percent target.
Trump on Wednesday proposed the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades, including lowering the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent and implementing a new 25 percent tax rate for pass-through businesses such as partnerships to boost the economy.
But the plan gave few details on how the tax cuts, which could cost about $1.5 trillion over a decade, would be paid for without increasing the budget deficit. That sets up what is likely to be a bruising battle in the U.S. Congress.
""The plan's price tag would also result in an increase in the national debt, which could make it difficult to pass as is. Odds are the proposal will be scaled back,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
Growth in consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, was unrevised at a 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter as an increase in spending on services was offset by a downward revision to durable goods outlays. 
Amid robust consumer spending, businesses accumulated a bit more inventory than previously reported to meet the strong demand. Inventory investment added just over one-tenth of a percentage point to GDP growth in the second quarter. It was previously reported to have been neutral.
Growth in business spending on equipment was unchanged at a rate of 8.8 percent, the fastest pace in nearly two years.
Investment on nonresidential structures was revised to show it increasing at a 7.0 percent pace, up from the previously reported 6.2 percent rate. There were minor revisions to government spending, exports and imports.
Investment in homebuilding was weaker than previously reported, with outlays falling at a 7.3 percent rate rather than at a 6.5 percent pace.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2017 11:50AM ET</span>","Weak German, Spanish inflation lends support to slow ECB exit","By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German and Spanish consumer prices rose less than expected in September, tilting a finely balanced monetary policy debate at the European Central Bank toward a more measured exit from its stimulus program.
Prices in Europe's largest economy rose 1.8 percent year on year, EU-harmonized data showed on Thursday - less than the 1.9 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll. In Spain, equivalent prices rose 1.9 percent, below the expected 2 percent.
Hawks at the ECB want the central bank, whose main policy target is an inflation rate of just under 2 percent, to scale back its asset purchases relatively quickly while doves favor a gradual withdrawal.
It is expected to decide this autumn - most probably in October - whether to curb its stimulus from next year.
""The figures allow the ECB to exit its expansionary monetary policy slowly,"" said Marco Bargel of Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""The inflation we are currently seeing in Germany and in the euro zone lends no reason to wait longer to wind down the bond purchases but at the same time there is no reason to rush.""
German inflation has consistently run above the euro zone average. Preliminary data for the whole bloc is due on Friday and should show a rise to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent in August, according to a Reuters poll.
MORE TO SPEND
The German economy grew by 0.7 percent on the quarter between January and March and by 0.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by household and state spending as consumers and authorities reap the benefits of record-low borrowing costs and a low unemployment rate.
Despite a robust growth outlook, leading economic institutes expect German inflation to remain below 2 percent in the next two years.
A breakdown of Thursday's data showed non-harmonized food and energy inflation picked up from August while services and rents were unchanged.
Economists say the weaker-than-expected German figures back expectations that relatively subdued price pressures will support a consumption-led upswing.
Sal Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens said she expected German wages to grow by up to 3 percent on average next year while she saw inflation remaining unchanged at roughly 1.7 percent.
""This means that workers still have more money in their pockets to spend,"" Kastens said. ""Private consumption will remain a growth driver also next year.""

Still, a consumer sentiment survey showed on Thursday that the cheerful mood among German shoppers weakened heading into October. The Nuremberg-based GfK institute said its index edged down to 10.8 points from 10.9 in the previous month, and linked the fall to rising prices.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 272,000 for the week ended Sept. 23, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
A Labor Department official said Harvey and Irma affected claims for Texas, Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Unadjusted claims for Florida increased by 8,160 last week, while filings in Texas fell by 8,218. Unadjusted claims for Georgia rose by 3,157 last week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 270,000 in the latest week. The storms have impacted the claims data in recent weeks and are expected to cut into job growth this month. Still, the labor market remains strong.
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 134 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 9,000 to 277,750 last week, the highest level since February 2016.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 45,000 to 1.93 million in the week ended Sept. 16. The so-called continuing claims have now been below the 2 million mark for 24 straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.
The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped 2,750 to 1.95 million, remaining below the 2 million level for the 22nd consecutive week. The continuing claims data covered the survey period for September's employment rate.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell 2,500 between the August and September survey weeks, suggesting little change in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.4 percent in August.

Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 10,000 to 270,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 277,750, up 9,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The third estimate of second quarter growth domestic product (GDP) showed growth of 3.1%, revised up from the previous reading of a 3.0% expansion.
That compared to 1.4% growth in the first three months of the year.
Analysts had expected growth to remain unchanged from the prior revision.
On the inflation front, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices also went unchanged as forecast at an increase of 0.3%.
Core PCE prices held steady at a 0.9% rise, in line with consensus.
The GDP price index was also not revised, showing a 1.0% advance that was in line with expectations.
However, corporate profits were revised lower to just a 0.1% rise in the second quarter, compared to an initial reading of a 0.8% gain and a forecast for a 0.9% increase.
Market participants are looking ahead to the publication of the advanced estimate of third quarter GDP to be released on November 29.
With the data for the July to September period expected to feel the impact of the hurricane season, the latest forecast from the New York Fed predicts a 1.6% expansion, while the Atlanta Fed projects growth of 2.1%.

Policy hawks at the European Central Bank, led by Germany, want it to scale back its asset purchases relatively quickly while doves favor a gradual withdrawal.
In the state of Hesse, annual inflation rose to 2.1 percent from 1.8 percent in August, and it was 2 percent on the year in Saxony.
The ECB, which is expected to decide this autumn - most probably in October - whether to curb its stimulus from next year, targets an inflation rate of just under 2 percent.
In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, inflation was unchanged at 1.9 percent. It was also unchanged at 1.8 percent in Bavaria and in Baden-Wuerttemberg at 1.9 percent.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT.
A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested EU-harmonized consumer price inflation ticked up nationwide to 1.9 percent in September from 1.8 percent in August.
That would maintain a consistent pattern of German inflation running above the euro zone average.
Preliminary data for the whole bloc is due on Friday and should show a rise to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent in August, according to a Reuters poll.

The survey showed that sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 113.0 in September from 111.9 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to 112.0.
Sentiment in industry rose sharply to 6.6 this month from 5.0 in August and optimism in the services sector, which produces more than two thirds of the euro zone's gross domestic product improved to 15.3 from 15.1.
Consumers became more optimistic too, with the indicator rising to -1.2 from -1.5, high above the long-term average of -12.5, and sentiment in retail trade jumped to 3.0 from 1.6.
Only in the financial services sector the mood worsened to 18.8 from 25.6 in August, the Commission data showed.
Inflation expectations picked up as more consumers expected prices to rise over the next 12 months, with the indicator rising to 14.2 from 11.6 in August.
Also in industry, manufacturers expected their selling prices to rise with the index rising to 10.5 from 8.1.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>",China September factory activity seen growing at slightly slower pace,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories likely cranked up activity for the 14th straight month in September as the country's year-long building boom and higher prices generate hearty profits, though the pace of growth may have eased slightly from August.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on Sunday is expected to come in at 51.5 for September, dipping marginally from August's 51.7, according to a median forecast of 24 economists polled by Reuters.
The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's manufacturers are reporting robust earnings, fueled by a government-led infrastructure spending spree, stronger factory-gate prices and a recovery in exports. 
Profit growth at Chinese industrial firms accelerated in August at the fastest monthly pace in four years due to higher commodity prices, data showed on Wednesday.
Steel mills, in particular, continue to run at full tilt to cash in on fat profit margins and build up inventories ahead of expected government curbs on production to reduce choking air pollution over the winter.[IRONORE/]
Worries about a sharp drop in demand in coming months have seen China iron ore futures plunge more than 20 percent since August, though steel prices have continued to rise.
MOMENTUM 
Bolstered by manufacturing and a hot property market, China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017, and looks set to easily meet the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent.
But there are signs that momentum is slowly starting to fade.
August data from industrial output to investment and retail sales was softer than expected, which many analysts attributed to a rise in borrowing costs this year as the government tries to reduce the risks from a rapid build-up in debt.
A flurry of government measures to cool soaring housing prices also appear to be tempering break-neck growth in the property sector, a key economic driver, though underlying demand for homes remains healthy.
Still, China watchers can't agree on how much progress the government is making in its overall debt ""derisking"" battle, and the extent to which it may be impacting the broader economy.
S&P last week downgraded China's sovereign credit rating, saying the government's deleveraging drive has progressed slower than expected, leading to higher economic and financial risks.
A ""Beige Book"" survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) pointed to a continued over-reliance on cheap, easy credit.
""It is a serious error to believe the current, impressive level of corporate performance is occurring despite true deleveraging,"" CBB said, adding that borrowing by Chinese companies was the second-highest in four years in the third quarter while lending rates fell after rising in the previous quarter.
""If 2018 sees actual tightening, it will be far more traumatic to firms than most analysts realize.""
The focus is now on the upcoming Communist Party Congress in mid-October, a once-every-five-years meeting where new leaders are appointed and the government's key political and economic initiatives are laid out, though details are usually not announced until much later. 
If growth does start to cool amid the tightening cycle, markets will be looking for signs that the government is comfortable with a slower pace of expansion, rather than jump in with more debt-fueled stimulus as it has often done in the past.
Economists expect the findings of a private survey on China's factory activity on Monday will be similar to the official reading, pointing to softer growth but not a sharp slump.
They predict the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) will dip slightly to 51.5 in September from 51.6 in August.

The official PMI survey and the Caixin PMI will be published on Sept. 30, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector. Caixin's services PMI will be released on Oct. 9.

(Reuters) - Rents for office space in London skyscrapers are still the highest across Europe, a report showed on Thursday, indicating that the capital remains one of the most sought after business hubs despite Britain's looming exit from the European Union.
Prime rents in London buildings over 30 storeys stood at $110 per square feet over the first half of the year, nearly double the $58 per square feet and $54 per square feet rent for buildings in Paris and Frankfurt respectively, according to the report by property group Knight Frank.
London's future as Europe's premier financial hub has been threatened by Brexit as many companies have said they may move some jobs out of the British capital if the country loses its access to Europe's single market and are already drawing up plans.
However so far the amount of office space take-up, including across the City of London and Canary Wharf financial districts, has been steady over the past year, prompting overseas groups to buy the British capital's best-known skyscrapers including the ""Cheesegrater"" and ""Walkie Talkie"".
""That London still commands the highest skyscraper office rents in Europe, despite the Brexit uncertainty, is a statement of its resilience and popularity as a business location,"" Knight Frank Chief Economist James Roberts said.
""Firms are willing to pay more to be in London skyscrapers than those in Frankfurt because they view the UK capital as a more important international hub,"" he added.
A Reuters survey has shown that around 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the country leaves the single EU market, with Frankfurt by far the most popular destination for new roles and Paris in second spot.
Knight Frank's report showed that rental growth for Frankfurt and Paris skyscraper offices was flat in the six months period, indicating that office values in financial cities expected to benefit from Brexit had seen a limited boost so far.

Growth in London rents, which are the fifth highest in the world behind cities such as Hong Kong and New York, was also flat over the period.

(Reuters) - Income and net worth among U.S. families increased broadly between 2013 and 2016, a reversal to years of stagnation that cut across education levels and race, and lifted lower-income families as well as top earners, the Federal Reserve said in its latest extensive review of the economic state of American households.
Income inequality still widened: the top 1 percent of families boosted their share of all income to 23.8 percent from 20.3 percent. With the share for the next 9 percent stagnant, those gains came through a decline in the income share for the bottom 90 percent of households, to 49.7 percent.
But within that distribution, median and mean incomes were rising across the spectrum, and family net worth increased as a broader set of families started setting aside money for retirement and benefiting from stock market gains of around 9 percent annually during the period.
The Fed conducts the survey every three years to measure income, debt and other trends among families, a core economic unit whose prospects and decisions are central to consumption and the overall performance of markets and the economy.
Though homeownership rates declined to 63.7 percent, continuing a slide from the 2004 peak of 69.1 percent, those who did own homes enjoyed an average 6 percent rise in their homes value.
Overall, the survey showed the benefits of the recovery being more extensively felt after a period in which an economic crisis and recession pummeled low- and middle-income earnings. Between 2007 and 2010 both mean and median family income fell, while between 2010 and 2013 median income fell though the mean was pulled higher by income growth at the top of the earnings distribution.
Over the last three year, by contrast, ""families throughout the income distribution experienced gains in average real incomes between 2013 and 2016, reversing the trend,"" the Fed wrote in a summary paper describing the results of its survey of 6,254 families.
The survey results were weighted to make estimates for the overall population.
Median income, which divides the top and bottom half of earners and is more indicative of broader growth, rose 10 percent over the period, to $52,700 from $48,100. The mean, or average, which can be dragged higher by excess earnings at the top, rose 14 percent, to $102,700 from $89,900.
The findings are in partial contrast to an economic narrative of stagnation, particularly among lower-income and less-educated workers, that has driven U.S. politics in recent years from the Occupy Wall Street movement to the election of Donald Trump. 
Rather, ""between 2013 and 2016, both median and mean income grew for all families grouped by educational attainment. The highest growth rates occurred among families without a high
school diploma, whose median and mean income grew 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Median income among families with a college degree grew only a modest 2 percent.""
Notably net worth - the value of all assets a family owns less the debts it owes - also reversed, rising 16 percent to $97,300.
There were stronger gains also for nonwhite and Hispanic families. Black families saw median income grow 10 percent while Hispanic median incomes grew 15 percent; that compares to 6 percent for white families, a discrepancy partly accounted for by higher earnings in general for whites.
Overall the results ""represents a return to a general pattern of substantial increases in both the median and the mean... dating back to the early 1990s.""
The survey did affirm one important trend connected with the 2016 election: a continued divergence in incomes between people who live in cities and those in rural areas. Median incomes for people in metropolitan statistical areas rose 10 percent; outside those urban hubs the increase was just 2 percent over the three-year period.
Though the Fed noted rising debt in some areas, such as education finance, overall household debt fell and leverage ratios comparing debt obligations to income also declined.

Notably, the percentage of families with retirement accounts also reversed its recent decline, rising to 52 percent from 49 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in August and shipments maintained their upward trend, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite an anticipated drag on growth from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
The signs of an acceleration in business spending on equipment bolstered prospects of a December interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, boosting the dollar and pushing up the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note to its highest level since 2008.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent gain in July.
""The manufacturing sector appears to be a bright spot in the U.S. economy,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Economists had forecast orders of these so-called core capital goods increasing 0.3 percent last month following a previously reported 1.0 percent jump in July. Core capital goods orders surged 3.3 percent year-on-year. Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.7 percent after advancing 1.1 percent in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
The Commerce Department said it was unable to isolate the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the data. Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, has hurt August retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales. 
Irma, which struck Florida early this month, is expected to further hold down housing activity. That was flagged by a report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors showing that contracts to buy previously owned homes dropped 2.6 percent in August to a 19-month low. 
As a result, the storms are expected to cut into third-quarter economic growth. Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are below a 2.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.0 percent pace in the second quarter.
The Federal Reserve last week signaled it expected to raise rates for the third time this year. Most economists expect the rate hike will be in December.
The dollar raced to a more than one-month high against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest-rate sensitive two-year note hitting its highest level since November 2008. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.
STRONG BUSINESS INVESTMENT
Business investment on equipment has been buoyed by the energy sector, where oil and gas drilling has rebounded after declining in the wake of a collapse in crude oil prices. Spending could get a further boost from plans by President Donald Trump to slash taxes and overhaul the tax code.
Trump and Republicans in the U.S. Congress are proposing a 20 percent corporate income tax rate, a new 25 percent tax rate for pass-through businesses such as partnerships, and a reduced 35 percent top income tax rate for individual Americans. Trump is expected to unveil the plan later on Wednesday.
Business spending on equipment added almost half-a-percentage point to GDP in the third quarter, the most in nearly two years. That is supporting manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
""Business equipment investment is on track for a big rise in the third quarter,"" said Michael Pearce, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Last month, orders for machinery, primary metals, computers and electronic products as well as transportation equipment increased. 
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, rebounded 1.7 percent last month as bookings for transportation equipment jumped 4.9 percent.

Durable goods orders fell 6.8 percent in July.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 2.6 percent to a reading of 106.3. July's index was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales declining 0.5 percent last month. It was the fifth time in six months that pending home sales have retreated.
Pending home contracts are viewed as a forward-looking indicator for the state of the housing market because they become sales one or two months later.
Given the contraction and the likely slowing of activity in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the NAR also said it now expects existing home sales this year to be below the 2016 level.
Although the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, the housing market has lost some steam this year. Home sales have weakened amid tight inventories while builders have cited shortages of land and labor as a curb on construction.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 2.6 percent. Contracts fell in all four regions of the country. The Northeast fared the worst with a 4.4 percent drop last month.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its pending home sales index decreased by a seasonally adjusted 2.6% last month, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.5%. That was the fifth decline in the last six months.
The reading on the index itself decreased to 106.3 in August from the prior 109.1. That was its lowest reading since January 2016.
Year-on-year, pending home sales fell at an annualized rate of 2.6% in August.
“This summer’s terribly low supply levels have officially drained all of the housing market’s momentum over the past year,"" NAR chief economist Larry Yun said.
This expert blamed the decline on limited listings and home prices rising far above incomes.
“Demand continues to overwhelm supply in most of the country, and as a result, many would-be buyers from earlier in the year are still in the market for a home, while others have perhaps decided to temporarily postpone their search,” he explained.
Yun added that Hurricane Harvey’s damage to Houston impacted contract signings in the South, while Hurricane Irma was likely to slow sales even further in the region.

The Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday that its retail sales balance jumped to +42 in September from a reading of -10 in August, the highest since September 2015 and far above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
British consumers have been squeezed this year by higher inflation triggered by the plunge in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. 
But the Bank of England said earlier this month there were some signs consumer demand might be picking up, though it was too soon to tell if this would offset weak business investment.
Most BoE policymakers have said they expect to back a first rate rise in more than a decade in the coming months if the economy and inflation pressures grow as they expect, and economists think this will come as soon as the BoE's next meeting on Nov. 2.
The CBI survey showed that retailers expect strong sales growth to continue into October, with the highest month-ahead expectations since the start of the year.
However, CBI economist Anna Leach urged caution. ""Inflation continues to squeeze household budgets, and with the pressure on incomes set to persist, retailers will continue to face a challenging environment,"" she said.
The BoE expects inflation to exceed 3 percent in October, and only to fall slowly over the next couple of years. The central bank does expect wage growth to pick up, though so far there is limited evidence of a rise.

British retail sales volumes recorded their biggest monthly gain since April last month, according to official data last week, although year-on-year sales growth remained well below levels seen last year at 2.4 percent.

""The strong euro cannot cloud the good mood among exporters at the moment. The most important driver for German exports remains the euro zone,"" Ifo head Clemens Fuest said.
Ifo's indicator for export expectations rose to 18.7 points in September from 18.2 in the previous month, with managers from nearly all industrial sectors giving a more upbeat outlook.
""Only the automobile industry had to cope with a noticeable damper. At the moment there are hardly any opportunities for export growth,"" Fuest said.
Germany's car industry, which is the country's biggest exporter and employs some 800,000 people, is engulfed in an emissions scandal.
European Union and German antitrust regulators are also investigating whether Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Porsche, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler held secret meetings to discuss suppliers, prices and standards to the disadvantage of foreign carmakers.
Ifo's latest data on export expectations followed the institute's broader and closely watched monthly survey on business confidence on Monday, which showed an unexpected drop in the weeks before the Sept. 24 federal election.

Merkel's conservatives remained the largest parliamentary bloc after Sunday's vote but bled support to the far-right. With coalition talks set to start, her only realistic option now is a tricky tie-up with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2017 03:20AM ET</span>",China's industrial profits jump most in four years on commodity price surge,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial companies rose the most in four years in August as commodities prices surged, thanks to a government-backed construction boom that is helping Beijing trim high levels of corporate debt without tripping up the economy.
The upbeat earnings report is another sweetener for authorities as China focuses on stripping out financial risks from years of credit-fueled growth and keeping the economy on a steady footing ahead of a crucial party gathering next month.
Profits in August jumped 24 percent year-on-year to 672 billion yuan ($101.21 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday.
Discounting the combined Jan-Feb profit rise of 31.5 percent, the latest earnings boost would be the biggest single monthly percentage surge since August 2013. The statistics bureau does not release single-month figures for Jan-Feb due to seasonal factors.
Annual profit growth was 16.5 percent in July. 
""The figures are really positive - they show China's efforts to cut down on overcapacity is working well,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING bank in Hong Kong. 
Crucially, Pang said that Beijing is also making headway in reducing debt risks. ""When you close down overcapacity factories, you are also deleveraging to an extent.""
The robust industrial earnings growth in August was driven by higher prices, particularly in sectors such as oil, steel and electronics, He Ping of the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. 
He estimated that surging prices contributed nearly one third of the new profits last month.
A year-long, government-led construction boom has fueled demand and prices for building materials, while China's push to cut excess capacity in heavy industries and its war on pollution has also appeared to intensify a short-term supply shortage and higher prices.
LOOMING RISKS
For the first eight months this year, the firms notched up profits of 4.92 trillion yuan, an increase of 21.6 percent year-on-year, picking up slightly from the 21.2 percent annual growth in the January-July period. 
The earnings data by sector, however, highlights the uneven nature of profit growth.
Earnings in the mining industry soared 5.9 times from a year earlier, coal mining enjoyed a 960 percent jump and manufacturing saw an 18.6 percent boost. Sectors such as electricity, gas and water production however saw their profits plunge 22.6 percent. 
A private survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) noted major risks are looming for 2018, with a reversal in the commodity boom being one of the top worries.
""It was demand and hot money inflows that kept prices rising. Neither was sustainable and now demand has clearly sputtered,"" it said.
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms, often debt-laden, were up 46.3 percent at 1.08 trillion yuan in January-August, compared with a 44.2 percent rise in the first seven months. But earnings for all SOEs for August alone were only up 4.3 percent on-year, Reuters calculations show.
A raft of August data back analysts' expectations for the economy to slow over coming months, as efforts by policymakers to clamp down on debt risks and defuse a property market bubble have raised financing costs and generally tightened monetary conditions. 
S&P Global Ratings downgraded China's long-term sovereign credit rating last Thursday, citing increasing risks from its rapid build-up debt. Chinese industrial firms' liabilities at the end of August were 6.4 percent higher than at the same point last year. 
Still, after a robust first-half growth is expected to easily meet the government's 6.5 percent target for this year in a welcome sign for Beijing ahead of a Communist Party Congress (CPC), which will see a key leadership reshuffle and the setting of policy priorities for the next five years.
""We are bullish on China's growth,"" ING's Pang said.
""It's not just capacity cuts that are boosting prices. Demand is quite strong too.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Switzerland is the world's most competitive economy for a ninth straight year, the Geneva-based World Economic Forum said on Wednesday.
Since suffering a rare blip in 2008, when it was nudged into second place by the United States, the Swiss economy has maintained an efficient but unshakeable grip on the top spot in the WEF annual ranking .
WEF economist Thierry Geiger said Switzerland had a virtuous circle of infrastructure, institutions and education, but at the heart of its success was the way it created and used talent.
""That is really the secret of Switzerland, this ability to innovate, supported by a whole range of enabling factors,"" he said.
However, after almost a decade at the top, Switzerland is at risk from complacency and populism. The ageing population could undermine the innovation miracle by shutting the door to foreign talent in one of the referendums that make Swiss law, he said.
""We see a proliferation of such referendums on everything, some of them are kind of dangerous, they could really endanger and jeopardize Switzerland's prosperity,"" Geiger said. 
The World Economic Forum, the same organization that runs the Davos meeting of global powerbrokers each January, bases its rankings on a dozen drivers of competitiveness and a survey of business leaders.
""Global competitiveness will be more and more defined by the innovative capacity of a country,"" Klaus Schwab, WEF founder and executive chairman, said in a statement.
Besides Switzerland, the top 10 remained the same as a year ago, although there was some shuffling of the order. The United States climbed over Singapore into second place, and Hong Kong jumped three places to sixth, leapfrogging Japan in ninth spot 
Britain slipped one place to eighth. It has not yet dropped in the rankings because of its Brexit negotiations with the European Union but it is expected to do so, the WEF said. 
China inched up one place to 27th, well ahead of 38th-ranked Russia and India, which was in 40th position. 

The wooden spoon went to Yemen, a poor country further devastated by civil war, economic collapse, cholera and near-famine conditions, which was in 137th place.

With the U.S. poverty rate near pre-recession levels and median income at an historic high, the improving economy is helping many Americans make ends meet.
Nonetheless, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, charged with guarding individuals' finances, found more than 40 percent of U.S. adults struggle to pay bills. It also found 34 percent have experienced material hardships in the last year such as running out of food or not having enough money for medical treatment.
""A large percentage of people are financially fragile,"" the report said. ""Overall, we find that the financial well-being of U.S. adults varies widely.""
The agency surveyed a representative sample of people on how well they can fully meet their financial obligations, secure their financial futures and make choices that allow them to enjoy their lives.
Within the group that achieved the average well-being score, approximately 20 percent of people still sometimes have difficulty paying for basic needs such as food, it said.
There is no one factor responsible for better financial well-being, according to the survey. But education provides the biggest boost, followed by age, with older Americans enjoying greater security. Good physical health also helps.
Gender did not appear to be a factor, the CFPB said, but race plays a minor role, with white non-Hispanic adults having slightly better financial health than those in other racial and ethnic groups.
Concerns about growing income inequality bubbled up across the country after the 2007-09 economic recession and was a leading campaign issue in the 2016 presidential election.
The CFPB, however, said income alone ""does not fully capture all of the underlying elements of financial well-being."" The survey showed it is also important to consider liquid savings.
Some consumers with lower incomes had healthier personal balance sheets than those with higher incomes. But at all income levels, those with the largest financial cushions were in the best shape, as they were able to cover unexpected expenses and felt secure.
In the same vein, the survey found those receiving Social Security retirement payments and employer-sponsored health and retirement benefits enjoy greater financial well-being.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell in September and home sales dropped to an eight-month low in August due to the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, supporting the view that the storms would hurt economic growth in the third quarter.
Still, relatively high levels of consumer confidence together with continued strong gains in house prices should support consumer spending and keep the economy on solid ground. Rebuilding in the hurricane-ravaged Texas and Florida also is expected to deliver a boost in the fourth quarter.
""Though hurricane disruptions will make spending uneven geographically over the next few months, we expect consumers to remain a primary driver of U.S. economic growth in 2018,"" said James Bohnaker, a U.S. economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.
The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index declined to a reading of 119.8 this month from 120.4 in August, which was the highest reading in five months. It said confidence in Texas and Florida ""decreased considerably.""
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, slipped to 14.5 this month from 16.0 in August. 
That measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, still remains consistent with more absorption of labor market slack. 
The number of consumers expecting an improvement in their incomes rose marginally to 20.5 percent in September from 19.9 percent last month. The share expecting a drop in income was little changed at 8.3 percent.
Despite being near full employment, the labor market has struggled to generate strong wage growth, frustrating both consumers and policymakers. But rising home prices should continue to underpin consumer spending, even though the housing market is slowing.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting the economy to grow at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, slowing from the April-June period's brisk 3.0 percent pace.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of house prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.8 percent in July on a year-on-year basis after increasing 5.6 percent in June.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
The dollar rose to a one-month high against the euro as investors worried that months of talks to form a coalition government in Germany could hurt the country's economy and make closer euro zone integration difficult. Stocks on Wall street were little changed, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
HOUSING SLOWING In a third report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales decreased 3.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 units last month, which was the lowest level since December 2016. Sales were down 1.2 percent on a year-on-year basis in August. 
New home sales, which are drawn from permits, account for 9.5 percent of overall home sales. The Commerce Department suggested Harvey and Irma likely impacted new home sales data last month. 
It said ""information on the sales status at the end of August was collected for only 65 percent of cases in Texas and Florida counties"" affected by the hurricanes. That compared to a normal response rate of 95 percent.
Harvey weighed on retail sales and industrial production in August. 
Last month, new home sales fell 4.7 percent in the South, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the new homes market. Harvey hurt sales of previously owned homes in August and held back the completion of houses under construction. 
With Irma slamming Florida in September, housing market activity could remain weak. The areas in Texas and Florida affected by the storms accounted for 14 percent of single-family home permits in 2016.
The housing market was softening even before the hurricanes struck, buffeted by headwinds including shortages of homes available for sale, skilled labor and suitable land for building. Rising prices for building materials are also undercutting the market.
In August, new single-family homes sales also fell in the Northeast and West. They were unchanged in the Midwest. 

""The U.S. housing market entered a strange kind of twilight zone over the summer, in which home prices kept rising steadily, but actual home sales activity largely leveled off at fairly underwhelming levels,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.

“It would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said Tuesday.
Yellen also expressed concerns that the slowing pace of inflation could force rates to remain lower for longer, reducing the central bank’s ability to ease monetary policy at times of market distress.
""Sustained low inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to low settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to ease monetary policy to fight recessions,"" Yellen said.
Yellen balanced her somewhat dovish comments, warning that the Federal Reserve should be ""wary of moving too gradually"" on interest rates as keeping its loose monetary policy measures in place for a prolonged period, increases the risk of the economy overheating.
At the press conference following the FOMC meeting last week, Yellen downplayed the significance of the weak core inflation data as the central bank signaled that an additional rate hike this year remained appropriate.

Franco noted that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma forced a considerable downward thrust in both Texas and Florida.
“Despite the slight downtick in confidence, consumers’ assessment of current conditions remains quite favorable and their expectations for the short-term suggest the economy will continue expanding at its current pace,” she added.

The average level of happiness for the 12 months to March this year rose slightly among the roughly 150,000 people polled to 7.51 out of 10 after leveling off in the previous two years at slightly below 7.50.

Despite the political shock, Britain's economy held up in 2016 although it slowed sharply in the first six months of 2017.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Economists expect Brazil's inflation rate to end 2017 below the government's target range for the first time ever, according to a central bank survey on Monday.
Consumer prices, as measured by the benchmark IPCA index, are likely to rise 2.97 percent in 2017, according to the median of around a hundred forecasts, down from 3.08 percent a week ago.
If confirmed, that rate would be at the bottom end of the central bank's official target range of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. The bank has missed its inflation target three times in the last two decades, but has never undershot it.
Indeed, this year's inflation rate may be even lower, with the five most accurate forecasters in the central bank survey predicting a 2.81 percent rate.
The results suggest the central bank may take its time to halt interest rate cuts, providing further support to Brazil's recovery from the deepest recession in a century.
According to the survey, the Selic rate, currently at 8.25 percent, is expected to end 2017 at a 7 percent all-time low and remain there until at least the end of 2018.
Monetary easing seem to be having some effect on household spending, with several economic indicators - from retail sales to gross domestic product (GDP) and employment - beating expectations in recent months, but not enough to generate substantial price pressures.
Inflation has held near 18-year lows for months as a surprisingly strong agricultural harvest hammered food prices lower. Services inflation, which is closely tied to aggregate demand, also remains subdued.

Economists polled by the central bank revised their forecasts for GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 to 0.68 percent and 2.30 percent, respectively, up from 0.60 percent and 2.20 percent.

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",German business morale clouds unexpectedly before election,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence deteriorated unexpectedly in the weeks before Sunday's federal election, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting that a consumption-led upswing in Europe's largest economy could lose momentum in coming months.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, edged down to 115.2 from 115.9 in August. The reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a value of 116.0.
The Ifo survey was conducted in the three weeks before the election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel won a fourth term but looks set to change coalition partners, meaning the indicator does not take into account the election outcome.
The drop in Ifo's headline figure was due to managers taking a more downbeat assessment of the current business situation as well as a more clouded business outlook for the next six months.
""We suspect that a more likely cause of the decline is the recent strength of the euro, rather than political uncertainty,"" Capital Economics analyst Stephen Brown said.
A sector breakdown of the Ifo figures showed the main drag came from manufacturing and wholesaling while sentiment improved against the trend in construction and retailing.
""In construction the index broke last month's record,"" Ifo said. A growing population, increased job security and record-low interest rates are fuelling a property boom in Germany.
Higher state spending on roads, bridges and social housing - also to accommodate an influx of more than one million migrants since 2015 - is giving the sector an additional push.
""STILL PERPLEXED""
Ifo's chief economist Klaus Wohlrabe said Sunday's election outcome could stoke uncertainty among business.
""At the moment people are still perplexed,"" Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that a so-called ""Jamaica"" coalition between Merkel's conservatives with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens would be difficult to achieve.
Wohlrabe said that new elections could not be excluded given the difficulty of forming a new government: ""So uncertainty can certainly spread.""
He added that the German economy would probably be weaker in the third quarter than the first two, but overall 2017 would be a very good year.
The German economy grew 0.7 percent on the quarter in the first three months of the year and 0.6 percent from April to June, driven by increased household and state spending as well as higher investment in buildings and machinery.
The Ifo index contrasted with last week's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) that showed Germany's private sector expanding at the fastest pace in almost six-and-a-half years in September.
The BDI industry association has said it expected the economy to grow by more than 2 percent this year adjusted for calendar effects, which would be the strongest pace in six years.

The Ifo German research institute said its Business Climate Index dipped to a seasonally adjusted 115.2 this month from a reading of 115.7 in August, missing forecasts for 116.0.
The Current Assessment Index decreased to 123.6 in September from 124.7 a month earlier and below expectations for 124.8.
The Business Expectations Index, which measures attitudes toward business prospects over the next six months, inched down to 107.4 this month from 107.8, falling short of forecasts for a reading of 107.9.
The monthly index is based on a survey of around 7,000 German firms in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail sectors.

Difficulties faced by most British employers in hiring the right workers decreased compared with last year, although still remained high, according to Hays' annual Global Skills Index, compiled with consultancy Oxford Economics.
Earlier this month the Bank of England stuck to its view that pay growth will pick up over the next few years as it signaled that it was likely to raise interest rates in November for the first time more than 10 years.
But official data so far has shown annual wage growth stuck around 2.0 percent, despite Britain's unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in more than four decades. 
""Candidates in areas of skills shortages remain in high demand and can receive multiple job offers and counter offers. They are also commanding significant salary increases, but generally wage pressure is easing across the UK,"" said Nigel Heap, managing director of Hays UK.
Engineering, IT and cyber security were the sectors suffering the most from a shortage of skilled workers, Heap said.
A weaker outlook for wage growth was common across European countries in the report, although Britain was among a handful on course to experience a decline in wages in inflation-adjusted terms over 2017 - along with Belgium, Italy and Spain, Hays said.

Its report was compiled using data from official sources and economic models from Oxford Economics, and covered the period to the second quarter of 2017.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.6 in September from a final 52.2 in August.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion contraction from the 13th consecutive month and reached the highest level since May.
""Firms signaled stronger expansions in both output and new orders amid reports of firmer demand both at home and abroad,"" said Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The strong end to Q3 bodes well for production in the coming months, with business confidence also perking up slightly since August,"" she said.
The index for new export orders rose to a preliminary 53.1 from 51.3 in the previous month. The flash index for new orders rose to 52.5 from 51.9 in August.
The output component of the PMI index also rose from August. 

The PMI survey follows government data last week showing Japan's exports in August rose at the fastest in nearly four years due to strengthening demand from overseas, offering further evidence that Japan's economy will continue to grow.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",British banks' pessimism in worst run since financial crisis,"LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism about the business environment among Britain's financial services firms declined again in the third quarter of this year, the longest run of falling sentiment since the global financial crisis, according to a survey published on Monday.
The latest quarterly survey of 94 financial services firms by business lobby CBI and consultancy PwC found sentiment about Britain's overall business climate deteriorating, with banks and building societies especially pessimistic.
Confidence in the financial services sector - Britain's biggest source of corporate tax revenue and largest export sector - has now declined in six of the last seven quarters.
""While demand in the sector is expected to hold up in the near term, we can't ignore the fact that optimism has dropped in almost every quarter for the past two years,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist.
The uncertainty about Britain's future trading relationship with the European Union continued to weigh on the industry. 
Britain will have to negotiate new trading terms with the EU and it is unlikely banks will retain access to sell their services and serve clients across the economic bloc.
Prime Minister Theresa May called on Friday for Britain to stay in the European Union's single market during a roughly two-year transition out of the EU while offering concessions on a divorce deal as she appealed for a revival of Brexit negotiations.

But the job market was broadly stable in the last quarter and firms are expected to step up the pace of hiring over the coming quarter, the survey showed.

1549,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 22, 2017 09:47AM ET</span>", U.S. Business Activity Remains Strong in September - Markit,"Investing.com – Business activity in the U.S. private sector slipped in September, but remained close to a seven-month peak, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to 54.6 in September, from the prior reading of 55.3.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The research group also said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 55.1 in September, from the prior month’s reading of 56.0. That was a two-month low.
Analysts had expected the reading to slip only to 55.9.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
IHS Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) inched up to 53.0 in September from the prior month’s final reading of 52.8.
That was a two-month high and in line with forecasts.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said that the report revealed that the U.S. economy maintained “encouraging resilience in a month of hurricane disruption” and that the rate of expansion remained robust.
“Historical comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the surveys point to the economy growing at an annualized rate of just over 2% in the third quarter,” he added.
Williamson noted that the biggest impact of Hurricane Harvey was evident in manufacturing supply chains, where resultant supply shortages were a key driver of higher prices.
“Supply delays were the most widespread in two and a half years, while input price inflation rose to the highest since 2012,” this economist pointed out.
""While repair work in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey may boost short-term business activity in coming months, a drop in business optimism about the year ahead suggests that companies have become less confident in the longer-term outlook,"" Williamson concluded.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1965 from around 1.1962 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3510 from 1.3544 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 111.94 compared to 112.02 before the release.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 91.83 compared to 91.84 before the report.

The number of overseas residents coming to Britain in July rose to 4.02 million, the highest for any month since records began and the first time the figure has topped 4 million.
That was 6 percent up on July 2016, the Office for National Statistics said.
By contrast, the number of British residents going abroad during the month fell by 2 percent to 6.94 million.
The value of sterling fell sharply after the June 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union, leading to higher inflation for British households - and more expensive holidays abroad - but lower prices for foreign tourists.
In the first seven months of the year, the number of overseas visitors to Britain rose by 8 percent while Britons traveling abroad rose by 3 percent, the ONS said, based on preliminary data.
Foreign visitors to Britain spent 13.3 billion pounds ($18.1 billion) in the January-July period, up 9 percent, while Britons increased their spending abroad by 5 percent to 24.3 billion pounds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone private businesses ended the third quarter growing much more strongly than predicted, bolstered by manufacturers, according to a survey which showed the momentum should carry on into October.
That energy, alongside rising inflationary pressures, is likely to increase expectations the European Central Bank will announce plans next month to reduce its monthly spending on quantitative easing.
IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for September, seen as a good guide to economic growth, bounced to 56.7 from August's 55.7, comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
September's reading was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which had predicted a dip to 55.5. The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.1989 <EUR=>, on track to end the week higher.
Earlier PMIs from Germany and France showed activity in the bloc's two biggest economies also exceeded the top end of expectations in Reuters polls.
""The euro zone PMI suggests that the economy remains very strong and will embolden policymakers at the ECB. Indeed, the price indices of the Composite PMI also picked up in September,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
The PMI pointed to third-quarter growth of 0.7 percent, IHS Markit said, faster than the median forecast in a Reuters poll last week for 0.5 percent.
The upturn came despite businesses increasing prices at one of the fastest rates this year. The output price index rose to 52.6 from 52.1.
""This rounds out a run of data that provide evidence of building pipeline inflation pressures. This will help to build a case for ECB tapering next year,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
The ECB will announce in October a six-month extension to its asset purchase program but will cut how much it buys each month to 40 billion euros from January, a Reuters poll of economists found last week.
The PMI for manufacturing soared to 58.2 from 57.4, confounding expectations for a fall to 57.1 and chalking up its highest reading since February 2011. An index measuring output rose to a 6 1/2-year high of 59.5 from 58.3.
Suggesting the solid pace would be maintained next month, factories built up a surplus of orders at the steepest rate in the sub-index's 15-year history. The backlogs of work index was 57.8, compared with August's 57.1.
""Firms are scrambling to expand capacity as fast as possible to meet order-book growth and rising backlogs is presenting them with huge problems,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Companies in the bloc's dominant service industry also had a much better month than expected - their PMI rose to 55.6. A Reuters poll had predicted no change from August's 54.7.
With activity thriving and new orders flooding in, their optimism also increased. The business expectations index jumped to 66.1 from 64.0.

The CBI's factory order book balance slipped this month to +7 from +13 in August, below expectations in a Reuters poll for the reading to remain unchanged. The CBI said the weakening was largely driven by the food and drink sector.
Britain's economy has slowed this year as the effect of a weaker pound has pushed up inflation and weakened consumer demand, but the Bank of England has said it is likely to raise interest rates at its next meeting on Nov. 2.
It hopes stronger exports will help offset weaker business investment and uncertain consumer demand.
The export order book balance softened marginally to +10 from +11, while the output balance for the past three months dropped to +17 from +30, its lowest since June, which the CBI said reflected weaker food and drink production.
However, all three balances remained well above their long run averages and manufacturers expect a rebound in October.
""Manufacturers continue to report solid growth in output, while total order books and export order books are holding firm,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
“Expectations for selling prices were largely in-line with the previous month, but price pressures do appear to have moderated somewhat since earlier in the year,"" she added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' confidence was expected to inch higher in September to hit its highest level in decade thanks to the upbeat global economy.
However, it was expected to worsen in the coming quarter given an outlook clouded by geopolitical risks.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rising by a point to plus 18 in September, a Reuters' poll of 20 economists showed on Friday.
That would be the fourth straight quarterly improvement and the strongest reading since December 2007 when the index was at 19.
The poll found that the sentiment index for big non-manufacturers' was expected to stay steady at plus 23 in September.
""We expect big manufacturers' mood to improve slightly, led by strong exports and factory output as the global economy picks up. And the domestic auto market recovery was also a tailwind,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
He added that upbeat consumption by foreign visitors and redevelopment in big cities underpinned the big non-manufacturers' mood.
But business confidence for both the big manufacturers and non-manufacturers is seen deteriorating in the coming quarter.
The sentiment index for big manufacturers is seen slipping to plus 16 in the next three months, and that of big non-manufacturers is expected to worsen to plus 20, the poll showed.
""Concerns for the future will likely weigh on business sentiment in a wide range. There are many factors to worry about,"" Ueno said.
He said uncertainty over U.S. policies remains strong, the North Korea situation may get tense, and there were also concerns over a possible slowdown in China's economy after the Communist Party congress.
Long periods of rain in August and sluggish wage growth could raise worries about the sustainability of a recovery in consumption, Ueno added.
Big corporations are seen raising their planned capital in the fiscal year to March 2018 by 8.3 percent, slightly up from the 8.0 percent seen in the June survey.
The BOJ will announce the quarterly tankan survey results at 8:50 a.m. on October 2 (2350 GMT on October 1).
CPI, CONSUMER SPENDING AND JOBS DATA
The poll showed the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was expected to gain by 0.7 percent in August, up for an eighth straight month on rising electricity and gasoline prices.
Industrial production was seen likely to rise 1.9 percent in August, the poll showed, up from a 0.8 percent decline in July.
Retail sales are expected to show an annual 2.6 percent gain in August, up for a 10th straight month.
Household spending is expected to rise 1.0 percent from a year ago versus a 0.2 percent slip in July, according to the poll.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, but the near-term outlook for the labor market was muddied by the continuing impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. 
Other data on Thursday showed manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in September amid a surge in new orders. But hiring by factories slowed and employees worked fewer hours this month compared to August.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended Sept. 16, the Labor Department said. A Labor Department official said Harvey and Irma affected claims for Texas and Florida. 
With Hurricane Maria lashing Puerto Rico this week, weather will likely continue to affect claims data and potentially hurt job growth in September. Texas and Florida account for about 14 percent of U.S. employment. 
""The noise will overwhelm any signal in these data for several weeks,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told reporters on Wednesday that ""payroll employment may be substantially affected in September"" by the storms, but she added that she expected labor market conditions would ""strengthen somewhat further."" 
Yellen made the comments after the U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged but signaled it still anticipated one more rate increase by the end of the year.
Last week, unadjusted jobless claims for Texas fell 23,549, the second straight weekly drop, as the effects of Harvey faded. Claims in Texas surged in the wake of storm, which disrupted oil, natural gas and petrochemicals production, leaving some workers temporarily unemployed.
Unadjusted claims for Florida rose by only 5,133 last week.
FURTHER INCREASES POSSIBLE
""It is possible we will see further increases in Florida claims in the coming weeks if the storm hindered people's ability to file claims immediately,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 300,000 in the latest week. It was the 133rd straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.
U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors continued to assess the Fed's policy statement. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose while the dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,000 to 268,750 last week, the highest level since June 2016.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls portion of September's employment report. 
The four-week moving average of claims rose by 28,250 between the August and September survey periods, suggesting a further slowdown in job growth. The economy added 156,000 jobs in August, with the private services sector hiring the smallest number of workers in five months. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its manufacturing activity index for the mid-Atlantic region rose about 5 points to a reading of 23.8 in September. It said almost 39 percent of the firms indicated increases in activity this month while 15 percent reported a decrease.
The survey's measure of new orders jumped to a reading of 29.5 this month from 20.4 in August. The employment index fell to 6.6 from 10.1 in August, but has now remained positive for 10 consecutive months. A measure of the average workweek dropped to a reading of 11.9 from 18.8 last month.

Firms were upbeat about the next six months, with nearly 44 percent expecting to raise capital spending. About 55 percent of companies said they expected to increase production in the fourth quarter. The firms planned to boost output by either increasing hiring or the hours of current workers.

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index surged to 23.8 this month from August’s reading of 18.9. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 17.2.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
With regard to future activity in the sector, new orders improved to 29.5, compared to the August's reading of 20.4.
The employment index decreased to 6.6 in September, compared to a prior reading of 10.1 and indicating a slower pace of hiring.
Following the report, that was released simultaneously with weekly jobless claims, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1914 from around 1.1915 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3501 from 1.3498 earlier, while USD/JPY was unchanged at 112.39.

1561,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2017 08:31AM ET</span>","U.S. Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Fall to 259,000","Investing.com - The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. unexpectedly fell last week, bolstering optimism over the health of the U.S. economy, official data showed on Thursday.
In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending September 16 decreased by 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 282,000 (initially 284,000).
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise to 300,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended September 9 advanced to 1.980 million from 1.936 million in the preceding week which was revised down from an initial reading of 1.944 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to increase to 1.975 million.
The four-week moving average was 268,750, a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's revised reading of 262,750 (initially 263,250).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Seasonally adjusted GDP rose 0.8 percent in the three months to the end of June, Statistics New Zealand said, up from a revised 0.6 percent the previous quarter. 
The growth was in line with analysts' expectations, and left annual GDP unchanged at 2.5 percent. 
The results were particularly closely watched just days before the polls open on Saturday in a hotly contested general election in which the economy has been a dominant issue. [nL4N1M12FU]
Thursday's outcome is unlikely to divert the Reserve Bank of New Zealand from its firm path of keeping rates on hold at record lows of 1.75 percent for years to stoke inflation. 
New Zealand's economic growth has been the envy of the developed world in recent years, often above 3 percent, but it encountered headwinds towards the end of 2016.
As in the previous quarter, the construction sector dragged on growth, falling 1.1 percent. The sector has been struggling with a labor shortage and rising costs. 
""We expected the June quarter to mark the high point for growth this year, given the one-off boost from tourism and a rebound in agriculture and transport,"" Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Bank, said in a research note. 
""In that light, a 0.8 percent quarterly rise is not that impressive,"" he said.
The quarterly jump was largely due to a flurry of spending as tourists flooded the country for international sporting events, which pushed retail spending and accommodation up 2.8 percent. [nL4N1KZ0K6]
GDP expenditure also grew 1.1 percent in the June quarter, largely due to exports rising on stronger prices for dairy, the country's largest goods export. 

The New Zealand dollar edged down to $0.7350 from $0.7364 after the data was released, though currency strategists said the market impact was likely to be relatively muted.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 07:05PM ET</span>","Fed keeps U.S. rates steady, to start portfolio drawdown in October","By Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but signaled it still expects one more increase by the end of the year despite a recent bout of low inflation.
The Fed, as expected, also said it would begin in October to reduce its approximately $4.2 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities acquired in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. 
New economic projections released after the Fed's two-day policy meeting showed 11 of 16 officials see the ""appropriate"" level for the federal funds rate, the central bank's benchmark interest rate, to be in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.50 percent by the end of 2017, or 0.25 percentage points above the current level.
U.S. bond yields rose, pushing up the U.S. dollar after the Fed's decision, but U.S. benchmark stock indexes were little changed. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose as far as 2.29 percent, the highest since Aug. 8., a move which helped push bank stock prices higher also.
“The Fed took another step on its path of beautiful normalization, announcing that the gradual balance sheet reduction will start next month and limiting revisions to both projections and policy guidance,” said Mohamed El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser At Allianz (DE:ALVG), in California. 
In its policy statement, the Fed cited low unemployment, growth in business investment, and an economic expansion that has been moderate but durable this year as justifying it's decision. It added that the near-term risks to the economic outlook remained ""roughly balanced"" but said it was ""closely"" watching inflation.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference after the end of the meeting that the fall in inflation this year remained a mystery, adding that the central bank was ready to change the interest rate outlook if needed.
""What we need to figure out is whether the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent,"" she said. If they do, ""it would require an alteration of monetary policy,"" Yellen said.
While the interest rate outlook for next year remained largely unchanged in the Fed's latest projections, with three rises envisioned in 2018, the U.S. central bank did slow the pace of anticipated monetary tightening expected thereafter.
It forecasts only two increases in 2019 and one in 2020. It also lowered again its estimated long-term ""neutral"" interest rate from 3.0 percent to 2.75 percent, reflecting concerns about overall economic vitality.
“The US Federal Reserve has firmly signaled that a December rate rise is still on the table,"" said Luke Bartholomew, of Aberdeen Standard Investments Investment Strategist in London.
""Clearly the Fed still believes that lower unemployment will eventually translate into a pick-up in inflation, but if inflation continues to undershoot it is hard to see the Fed following through on a hike,” he said. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve will resume rate hikes in December and raise borrowing costs three more times in 2018, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday.
The U.S. central bank will also reduce the size of its asset stock pile by about $1.4 trillion over the next several years as it seeks to restore a normal environment for monetary policy, according to the poll of Wall Street's top banks taken after the Fed's latest policy meeting, which ended on Wednesday. 
FED BOND PORTFOLIO TO SHRINK FROM OCTOBER
The Fed, as expected, also said it would begin in October to reduce its approximately $4.2 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities by initially cutting up to $10 billion each month from the amount of maturing securities it reinvests. 
That action will start a gradual reversal of the three rounds of quantitative easing, or bond buying, the Fed pursued between 2008 and 2014 to stimulate economic growth after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. 
The limit on reinvestment is scheduled to increase by $10 billion every three months to a maximum of $50 billion per month until the central bank's overall balance sheet falls by perhaps $1 trillion or more in the coming years.
Yellen said it would take a ""a material deterioration"" in the economy's performance for the Fed to reverse a schedule that she expects to proceed ""gradually and predictably.""
BALANCING ACT
The policy statement and accompanying projections showed the Fed still in the middle of a balancing act between an economic recovery that has kept U.S. unemployment low and is gaining steam globally and a recent worrying drop in U.S. inflation.
Three of the hawkish policymakers appeared to move their expected policy rate down to account for only one more hike by the end of 2017, leaving a core 11 clustered around a likely December increase. The Fed has raised rates twice this year.
The Fed noted that the recent hurricanes in the United States would affect economic activity but are ""unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.""
Forecasts for economic growth and unemployment into 2018 and beyond were largely unchanged. Gross domestic product is now expected to grow at a rate of 2.4 percent this year, 2.1 percent next year and 2.0 percent in 2019.
The unemployment rate is forecast to remain at 4.3 percent this year before falling to 4.1 percent next year and remaining there in 2019.
Inflation is expected to remain under the Fed's 2 percent target through 2018 before hitting it in 2019.
There were no dissents in the Fed's policy decision.

“Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in its statement on Wednesday following a two-day meeting in Washington.
“Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.”
As expected, policymakers left the benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1% to 1.25%.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 02:42PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales hit 12-month low, Harvey weighs on Houston","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell to their lowest in a year in August as Hurricane Harvey depressed activity in Houston and a persistent shortage of properties on the market sidelined buyers.
The third straightly monthly decline in sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a drop in homebuilding activity in August. The reports suggest housing will probably weigh on economic growth again in the third quarter.
""One of the risks out there for the broader economy is that this house of cards comes tumbling down,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The housing sector is the one area of the economy that just never reached a full recovery from the recession.""
Existing home sales decreased 1.7 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million units last month. That was the lowest level since August 2016. The NAR said Harvey, which struck Texas in the last week of August, had resulted in sales in the Houston area falling 25 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
Stripping out Houston, existing home sales would have been unchanged in August, the Realtors group said. Home resales in the South tumbled 5.7 percent last month.
Harvey, and a second hurricane, Irma, which slammed Florida early this month could hurt September home sales. Texas and Florida account for more than 18 percent of existing home sales. Sales lost because of delays in closing contracts will be recouped in 2018.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies after the Federal Reserve signaled it still expected to raise interest rates for a third time this year despite low inflation. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell as did stocks on Wall Street. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said though the hurricanes will hold back economic growth in the third quarter, ""past experience suggested that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.""
HOUSING STALLING
Even before the hurricanes struck, home sales had virtually stalled amid tight inventories that have resulted in home price increases outpacing wage gains. Sales were up 0.2 percent from August 2016. A second report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications fell last week 
""As we continue to process the third-quarter housing data, we are gaining confidence in our view that real residential investment will fall during the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Housing subtracted 0.26 percentage point from gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
Builders have blamed shortages of labor and land as well as higher costs of building materials for their inability to ramp up construction. Economists and builders say Harvey and Irma could worsen the housing shortage as scarce labor is pulled toward the rebuilding effort and materials are bid higher. 
A report on Tuesday showed housing completions tumbling to a 10-month low in August. At the same time single-family home permits fell to a three-month low. These developments suggest housing inventory will remain troublesome for a while.
The NAR said the number of homes on the market fell 2.1 percent to 1.88 million units in August. Supply was down 6.5 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 27 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
As a result, the median house price increased 5.6 percent from a year ago to $253,500 in August. That was the 66th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. Annual wage growth has not exceed 2.5 percent this year.
Underscoring the strong demand for houses, homes sold in August typically stayed on the market for 30 days. That compared to 36 days a year ago. 
High house prices as a result of tight inventories are sidelining first-time homebuyers. In August, first-time buyers accounted for 31 percent of transactions, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market.
August's share of first-time homebuyers was the smallest in a year and was down from 33 percent in July.

In a move largely expected by financial markets, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) agreed to keep its benchmark rate target at 1%-1.25%, forecasting at least one more hike this year.
The accompanying statement also revealed the Fed’s plan to reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet it built up in the wake of financial crisis. The central bank expects to begin normalization of its balance sheet in October, sticking with the plan detailed in June.
In a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy, members of the rate-setting committee revised upwards their projections for economic growth this year and stuck with the previous rate-hike outlook released in June.
They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.4% in 2017, a 0.2% increase from the previous projection of 2.2% in June. The trend of slowing inflation, however, forced the central bank to scale back its inflation expectation to 1.5% for 2017, down 0.2% from the 1.7% forecast in June.
The ""dot plot,"" part of the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, indicated that the central bank saw rates rising to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of the 2017. With rates steady at 1-1.25%, that points to one further rate hike this year. The majority of traders - more than 70% - expect the rate hike in December, according to Investing.com's fed rate monitor tool.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 11:59AM ET</span>","U.S. mortgage applications fall on higher rates, storms: MBA","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications recorded their steepest weekly drop since December on a pickup in borrowing costs and Hurricane Irma's impact on Florida, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted weekly index on mortgage activity declined 9.7 percent to 417.5 in the week ended Sept. 15, its biggest decrease since a 12.1 percent fall in the Dec. 23, 2016.
The drop reversed the preceding week's 9.9 percent increase which was the biggest in 14 months.
""The decline in application volume last week was influenced by a rise in rates, the ongoing impact of the hurricanes on Florida and Texas, and a potential slowdown following the Labor Day holiday week,"" MBA economist Joel Kan said in a statement.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged up to 4.04 percent from the prior week's 4.03 percent, which was the lowest since November, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average interest rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were anywhere from 2 basis points lower to 5 basis points higher than in the previous week.
Borrowing costs rose from nine-month lows in step with higher Treasury yields as investors pared their bond holdings due to stronger-than-forecast inflation data in August and reduced anxiety about the degree of slower economic growth due to Irma and Hurricane Harvey, Kan said.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase mortgage activity, a proxy on future home sales, fell 10.8 percent from a near three-month peak to 224.7 in the latest week. 
The group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage refinancing activity retreated from a near nine-month peak, falling 8.5 percent to 1,497.8. 
The share of refinancing requests versus total applications grew to 52.1 percent from the prior week's 51.0 percent.
Meanwhile, mortgage activity in Texas rebounded last week, rising 27 percent, which was not adjusted for seasonal factors, Kan said.
The level of applications in Texas has not fully recovered after it was severely depressed the prior two weeks by disruptions from Harvey. 
On the other hand, home loan applications in Florida fell for a second week, down 22 percent from the prior week due to Irma.
Excluding Texas and Florida, total mortgage applications were up 13 percent last week on an unadjusted basis, according to Kan.

The industry data showed that home resales unexpectedly decreased by 1.7% in August to a seasonally adjusted 5.35 million units from 5.44 million units in the previous month. That was the lowest reading since the same period in 2016.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.3% increase to 5.44 million units in August.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
The report indicated that strained supply levels continued to subdue overall activity, while gains in the Northeast and Midwest were outpaced by declines in the South and West.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that, despite the slump, there was still a solid level of demand for buying a home.
“Steady employment gains, slowly rising incomes and lower mortgage rates generated sustained buyer interest all summer long, but unfortunately, not more home sales,"" he said.
“What's ailing the housing market and continues to weigh on overall sales is the inadequate levels of available inventory and the upward pressure it's putting on prices in several parts of the country,” Yun explained.
“Sales have been unable to break out because there are simply not enough homes for sale,” this expert added.
After the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1996 compared to 1.1998 before the release, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.351, compared to 1.3552 before the data, while USD/JPY traded at 111.47 compared to 111.46 earlier.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 06:00AM ET</span>",Shopping surge in August boosts British rate hike bets,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales unexpectedly surged in August, official figures showed on Wednesday, boosting the chance the Bank of England will raise interest rates at its next meeting.
The data came, however, as a BoE survey showed businesses generally reporting slowing demand across a number of consumer-facing sectors as well as subdued labor cost growth.
Last week the BoE surprised investors by saying it was likely to raise rates in the coming months if the economy and inflation pressures strengthen as expected, despite the uncertainty about Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
Wednesday's official data showed a sharp pick-up in monthly sales growth in August to its fastest since April, despite inflation pressures that have previously squeezed spending. 
Retail sales volumes rose 1.0 percent month-on-month, double the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and July's sales growth was revised up to 0.6 percent.
Sterling jumped by more than half a cent against the U.S. dollar  and 10-year British government bond yields (GB10YT=RR) rose to their highest since February as markets priced in an increased chance of a rate rise.
""Consumers are showing an impressive resilience in the face of the ongoing real pay squeeze,"" said Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics. ""As a result, a modest pick-up in household spending should help the economy to re-accelerate a little ... and adds weight to our view that the Monetary Policy Committee will hike interest rates in November.""
Looking at the three months to August as a whole, which smoothes out monthly volatility, sales growth rose to 1.2 percent from a three-monthly rate of 0.7 percent in July.
However, the ONS said near-record sales growth would be needed in September to stop third-quarter growth slowing from the three months to June.
BoE policymakers expect moderate third-quarter retail sales growth as consumer demand shows signs of improving after weakness earlier in the year, though they said it was too soon to tell if it would compensate for weak business investment.
Compared with a year earlier, sales in August were up 2.4 percent versus expectations of a 1.1 percent rise.
""Within this month's retail sales we are seeing strong price increases.... However, we are still seeing underlying growth in sales volumes, and with strong growth in non-essential purchases,"" ONS statistician Kate Davies said.
INFLATION SQUEEZE PEAKING?
Rising inflation has eaten into British consumers' disposable income this year, causing the weakest first quarter for retail sales since 2010, as the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote pushed up the cost of the imports.
The BoE survey on Wednesday that showed businesses reporting slowing demand also suggested that the effect for the post-Brexit vote weaker pound appeared to be at its peak.
Last week the BoE said it expected consumer price inflation to peak at just over 3 percent in October, compared with 2.9 percent now, and then fall slowly. 
The narrower measure of inflation used in retail sales data rose to an annual rate of 3.2 percent in August, up from 2.7 percent. Looking just at goods sold in non-food stores, inflation was its highest since March 1992.
Official data last week showed wages in the three months to July were 0.4 percent lower in real terms than in 2016, and a survey of households by financial data company Markit reported the biggest squeeze in three years.
Private-sector figures had given a mixed message on retail spending in August. The Confederation of British Industry reported the weakest performance since July 2016, while the British Retail Consortium said top-line growth was the fastest so far this year. 

 Kingfisher  (L:KGF), Britain's biggest home improvements retailer, said earlier on Wednesday that purchases of expensive items such as power tools and new kitchens had not changed, though it was cautious about the outlook.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 06:00AM ET</span>","Taiwan's export order growth eases, may pick up speed on iPhone X","By Jess Macy Yu and Liang-Sa Loh
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders rose for a 13th straight month but at a slower pace in August, a boon for the region's tech-manufacturing economies riding the surge in global demand for electronics products. 
Strong exports of chips and other tech devices will set the export-driven economy up for a strong year-end and help Taiwan meet its bumped-up growth forecast of 2.11 percent this year. The solid outlook will also give the central bank leeway to stand pat on interest rates at its policy review on Thursday. 
Export orders in August jumped 7.5 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, slower than the 8.5 percent median estimate in a Reuters poll and 10.5 percent in July. Total export order value for August was $40.8 billion. 
The economics ministry said it expects September export orders to grow in the range of 1.3 to 3.6 percent, and total $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, due to the deferred launches of some new smartphone models, Lin Li-chen, director of the ministry's statistics department, told a news conference. 
""This year's situation is not quite the same compared to the past where there was one main smartphone model type...It is related to the effect of the iPhone models,"" Lin added. 
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets such as Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone X, whose models will be launched in September and November, respectively.
While both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will be available in September, the premium iPhone X won't be launched until November, slightly later than some expectations. 
The product launches are likely to keep manufacturers busy well into the fourth quarter, as orders typically lead actual shipments by two to three months.
LATE BOOST 
Taiwan's near-term outlook for electronics exports will largely depend on Apple's supply chain pattern of production and shipments, DBS said in a research note ahead of the data. 
Last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced three new iPhone models, including the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and a premium version iPhone X which includes OLED screen and facial recognition technology. 
""The implications for Taiwan are that electronics exports will still enter a seasonal upturn from 3Q onwards, similar as in the previous years. But a strong rise may only emerge in 4Q when the mass production of iPhone X kicks in,"" DBS said in its note. 
DBS said demand for electronics components could remain buoyant well into the first half of 2018, due to belated support from the iPhone X. 
Orders from Taiwan's two biggest markets showed a mixed picture. While August export orders from China grew 11.6 percent on year, faster than 10.7 percent the previous month, they fell 0.8 percent from the United States versus 7.7 percent growth in July.
For 2017, U.S. export orders are still expected to be the biggest in volume terms, as many communications products orders come from the United States and Europe, particularly Apple orders, Lin said. 
Export orders leapt 21.3 percent from Europe and rose 13 percent from Japan.
Earlier on Thursday, Japan reported its strongest export growth in nearly 4 years on booming global demand for its cars and electronics.

That compares with the BGA's previous forecast for a 1 percent increase in revenues.
""The mood at the moment is better than it has been for six years,"" BGA President Anton Boerner said, adding that as long as crises and wars did not hit trade flows, they would not affect the sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Booming shipments of cars and electronics in August drove up Japan's exports at the fastest pace in nearly four years, further evidence that overseas demand is strong enough to support healthy economic growth.
The 18.1 percent annual increase in exports was the fastest since November 2013 and handily beat the median estimate for a 14.7 percent annual rise seen in a Reuters poll. 
August's export result was well up on July's 13.4 percent, and marked a ninth straight month of expansion. 
Export growth is seen likely to continue as the global economy remains on a solid footing, which should underpin policymakers' confidence in Japan's economic outlook.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2017 12:09PM ET</span>","U.S. homebuilding weakens again, hurricanes muddy outlook","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in August as a rebound in the construction of single-family houses was offset by persistent weakness in the volatile multifamily home segment.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed building permits racing to a seven-month high in August. However, permits for single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped.
The mixed readings suggested housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. Homebuilding has been treading water for much of this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.
Housing starts slipped 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units, the Commerce Department said. Starts for July were revised higher by 35,000 units. Building permits surged 5.7 percent to a rate of 1.30 million units in August, the highest level since January.
The data suggested limited impact on permits from Hurricane Harvey, which lashed Texas in late August and caused unprecedented flooding in Houston. The Commerce Department said the response rate from areas affected by the storm ""was not significantly lower.""
Harvey, however, appeared to have held down home completions, which tumbled 10.2 percent to a 10-month low. The percentage drop in completions was the largest since April 2013. Completions in the South fell 22.2 percent, the biggest drop in seven years.
Homebuilding could slump further in September in the aftermath of Harvey and Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida. According to Census Bureau data, the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of permits issued in the nation last year.
Though activity could pick up as the hurricane-ravaged communities rebuild, the dearth of labor could curb the pace of increase in homebuilding. A survey Monday showed confidence among homebuilders fell in September amid concerns that the hurricanes could worsen the labor shortages and make building materials more expensive. 
""With the pace of housing starts in July and August retreating, and a likely depressed September, we now anticipate that housing starts will fail to expand much, if at all, in the third quarter,"" said Kristin Reynolds, a U.S. economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Economists had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.18 million-unit pace last month. Investment in homebuilding contracted in the second quarter at its steepest pace in nearly seven years, leading to housing subtracting 0.26 percentage point from gross domestic product growth.
IMPORT PRICES RISE 
The data is unlikely to change expectations that the Federal Reserve will announce on Wednesday a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Fed officials were scheduled to start a two-day meeting later on Tuesday.
The PHLX index of housing stocks (HGX) was flat in line with a broadly unchanged U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), slipped 0.24 percent. The dollar was trading lower against basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell marginally.
Policymakers could, however, take comfort from signs that inflation is picking up after retreating in recent months. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said import prices jumped 0.6 percent in August amid increases in the cost of petroleum products and a range of other goods.
August's increase in import prices was the largest in seven months and followed a 0.1 percent dip in July. In the 12 months through August, import prices surged 2.1 percent after rising 1.2 percent in July. Data last week showed a broad increase in consumer prices in August.
Despite the recent weakness, housing continues to be supported by a labor market that is near full employment. In addition, mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. 
Homebuilding rose 1.4 percent in August on a year-on-year basis. 
Single-family homebuilding jumped 1.6 percent to a rate of851,000 units in August. Single-family permits, however, fell 1.5 percent to a 800,000-unit pace. With permits lagging starts, single-family homebuilding could decline in the months ahead.
""We suspect single-family starts are set to slow,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Hurricanes Harvey and Irma will also likely slow starts in coming months, as resources are redirected toward repairs and rebuilding efforts.""
Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has cooled since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Last month, single-family starts rose in the South and West, but fell in the Midwest and Northeast. 

Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment tumbled 6.5 percent to a rate of 329,000 units. Multi-family permits vaulted 19.6 percent to a 500,000-unit pace in August.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's exports should grow about 10 percent this year to reach $22 billion, Trade Minister Tarek Kabil said on Tuesday, as the country lures foreign investors keen on setting up manufacturing following economic reforms.
He also told Reuters in an interview that China was set to be the country's fastest growing investment partner.
Egypt has been looking to plug a gaping trade deficit that stood at $42.64 billion last year but which has been narrowing in recent months, helped by a currency float that halved the pound currency's value, making Egyptian goods cheaper abroad and buying more expensive.
""Exports will be higher than last year, we expect about $22 billion,"" Kabil said. Last year, they were at about $20 billion.
Earlier, he told a Euromoney financial conference that the trade balance this year had been reduced by 37 percent, with imports down 23 percent to almost $30 billion and exports growing by 11.5 percent to $15 billion.
Egypt has been trying to market itself as a manufacturing hub for foreign investors, with easy access to European markets, relatively cheap labor, and economic reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program it hopes will instill confidence in investors, many of whom fled after the 2011 uprising. 
Foreign direct investment for the fiscal year that ended in June hit $7.9 billion, but Cairo is hoping a new investment law offering a slew of incentives which is expected to be active within weeks will help it top $10 billion this year.
Egypt trade: http://reut.rs/2xNxlYf 
Kabil told Reuters he expects China to be the fastest growing investor in coming years, with Egypt positioned to reap major investments from its Belt and Road initiative, a global development project aimed at expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe.
""Currently (the European Union) is the biggest but I think China investors will grow rapidly... We're in discussion with major players in terms of textiles and automotives. Those are two main projects we are in discussions with,"" said Kabil, without providing more specific details.

Egypt and China this month signed a memorandum of understanding for Beijing to finance a rail link worth about $739 million to serve a new administrative capital, a large portion of which is expected to be constructed by Chinese developers.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Retail sales in Russia rose more than expected in August, data showed on Tuesday, underpinning an official forecast that the economy is on track to return to growth levels seen before its 2015-16 slowdown.
Russia's oil-dependent economy has benefited from a recovery in global crude prices, prudent fiscal policy and the central bank's anti-crisis monetary measures.
But the recovery could still be hampered by declining wages, with average monthly salaries falling to 38,040 roubles ($655) in August, its lowest since February. 
The data from the Federal Statistics Service showed retail sales - a gauge of consumer demand, which is Russia's key economic driver - grew 1.9 percent in August, compared with a year ago.
That was above the 1.2 percent growth predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll.
""This pick-up has been supported by falling inflation, which has reduced the squeeze on households’ purchasing power,"" analysts at Capital Economics said on a report.
Last Friday the Russian Central Bank increased its forecast for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of this year to 1.7-2.2 percent from 1.3-1.8 percent. 

However, real wages data surprised on the downside. Real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, were up 3.7 percent in August. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected them to grow by 4.2 percent.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased to $123.1 billion from a downwardly revised $113.5 billion in the first quarter. 
That was the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2008. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit slipping to $115.1 billion from a previously reported $116.8 billion shortfall.
The second-quarter current account deficit represented 2.6
percent of gross domestic product, the largest since the first quarter of 2016, up from 2.4 percent in the first quarter.
The current account deficit has dropped from a record high of 6.3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as rising domestic oil production and lower global oil prices curbed the import bill.
In the second quarter, the surplus on primary income - which
includes investment income such as dividends, and employee compensation - decreased by $2.9 billion.

The deficit on secondary income, U.S. government grants, pensions, fines and penalties, and worker remittances surged by $7.5 billion in the second quarter.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors improved more than expected in September as worries about the stronger euro  faded, suggesting that markets expect Europe's biggest economy to continue its solid performance in coming months.
Record-high employment, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs are driving a consumer-led upswing in Europe's biggest economy that looks set to help Chancellor Angela Merkel win a fourth term in office in a federal election on Sunday.
The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed its economic sentiment index rose to 17.0 from 10.0 in August. This beat a Reuters consensus forecast for an increase to 12.5.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged up to 87.9 from 86.7 last month. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast predicting a dip to 86.6.
In a further positive sign for the German economy, the HDE retail association on Tuesday raised its 2017 forecast for nominal sales to grow by 3 percent, up from its previous prediction of 2 percent.
ZEW head Achim Wambach said financial market experts were more upbeat because of Germany's solid economic growth figures in the second quarter, a surge in bank lending and increased investment activity by both the government and firms.
""Their expectations are further corroborated by stable global economic development,"" Wambach said, adding that worries about negative effects of the stronger euro had faded into the background.
Wambach also said that the German federal election does not seem to have been a source of uncertainty.
Merkel's conservatives are expected to win Sunday's federal election. But they are likely to fall short of a clear majority and it remains unclear which smaller parties Merkel will start coalition negotiations with.
Capital Economics analyst Stephen Brown said the surprisingly solid rise in German investor sentiment suggested the economy would continue to perform well.

The BDI industry association last week said it expected the German economy to grow by more than 2 percent this year adjusted for calendar effects, which would be the strongest pace in six years.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2017 09:40PM ET</span>","Australia jobs pick-up to continue, but leave wages behind: RBA","SYDNEY - Australia's central bank has turned more upbeat on the economic outlook led by an improving labor market, although it remained worried about rising household debt and a strong local dollar.
   Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) September meeting showed policy makers also doubted the strength in jobs would lead to a much-needed pick up in wages anytime soon.
Balancing the risks from record-high private debt amid tepid inflation, the RBA has held rates at 1.50 percent after last easing in August 2016. Many economists suspect rates could stay at current levels for another year.
   Yet, recent data on the country's labor market has sparked greater optimism at the central bank. 
   ""Solid growth in employment was expected to continue, which would support household incomes and thus spending in the period ahead,"" the minutes showed.
The bank still expected growth in wages to remain low ""for some time"" and to accelerate only gradually.
Data out last week showed Australia's jobs leapt 54,2000 in August, the biggest jump since October 2015. Full-time jobs have also made a remarkable comeback this year having declined in 2016. 
Corporate profits have also surged while measures of business confidence and conditions are the strongest since 2008.
   Indeed, the RBA has forecast the A$1.7 trillion economy would grow ""above potential"" at around 3 percent over the next couple of years.
   One worry is the unemployment rate, at 5.6 percent, is still high as more people look for work. That is limiting upward pressure on wages which is rising at its slowest pace ever at 1.9 percent.
   Growth in housing debt has outpaced incomes, a result that threatens economy-wide spending.
   Indebtedness has increased as more Australians speculate in the property market, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne where home prices have broadly doubled since 2008.

   Regulators have taken stringent action since the start of the year to ease the brisk pace of house prices. The RBA noted there was clearer evidence of a cooling in Sydney, but less so in Melbourne.
   Board members also noted the recent rise in the Australian dollar , which raced to a two-year peak of $0.8125 this month amid a broad decline in the U.S. dollar.

Please see below for the full text of the minutes.
Sydney – 5 September 2017
Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Catherine Tanna
Members granted leave of absence to Carol Schwartz AM in terms of section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959.
Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Ivan Roberts (Head of Asian Economies Research Unit, Economic Research Department)
Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary)
Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that labour market conditions had continued to improve, although spare capacity remains. Employment had risen further in July, the participation rate had edged higher and the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5.6 per cent. Full-time employment had risen strongly over the preceding year (even though it had declined in July) and had outpaced the growth in part-time employment over that period. Members noted that the improvement in the labour market since late 2016 had been broadly based across the states. Forward indicators suggested that the improvement in labour market conditions was likely to continue. Members discussed current influences on the participation rate, noting in particular the rise in participation by older female workers as they delayed their retirement.
While unemployment rates in Queensland and Western Australia had remained high relative to earlier periods, employment growth in those states had risen, suggesting that the labour market adjustment to the earlier decline in the terms of trade and falling mining investment was progressing. In the context of a broader discussion of economic developments in Queensland, members observed that economic conditions in the state had generally strengthened over recent quarters, reflecting continued growth in consumption and, increasingly, a pick-up in business investment and public demand. Strength in tourism and other service industries had supported growth in aggregate demand in Queensland. In contrast, population growth had been below average, reflecting lower net overseas and interstate migration.
Members discussed the broad trends in activity by industry across the eastern states over the preceding decade or so. The cycle in mining activity and commodity prices, the spillover to related industries and the sustained strength in construction had dominated developments in Queensland. Members noted the increasing contribution to growth from the education and training sectors, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, which had been supported by demand from overseas. The trend decline in manufacturing was evident across all states on the eastern seaboard.
The wage price index data for the June quarter confirmed that wage growth had remained stable at a low rate. Other data showed that wage increases in new enterprise bargaining agreements had remained below the average of current agreements. Members noted that these data were consistent with the Bank's forecast for growth in wages to remain low for some time, before picking up gradually in response to the strengthening labour market. The pattern of growth in wages across industries had broadly mirrored the pattern of employment growth, with higher outcomes in the healthcare and education sectors and lower wage increases in the mining and retail sectors.
Members were briefed on developments in the housing market. For Australia as a whole, after population growth had outpaced growth in the number of dwellings for much of the decade from the mid 2000s, the converse had been true in recent years. Although dwelling investment remained at a high level, members noted that building approvals had stepped down and the pipeline of residential construction work appeared to have passed its peak. In Western Australia, dwelling investment had declined significantly, while in Queensland it had declined from very high levels and the stock of work in the pipeline was being worked down gradually. Although a further substantial increase in dwelling investment was not expected, the large amount of work remaining in the pipeline in New South Wales and Victoria suggested that dwelling investment was likely to stay at a high level in the subsequent couple of years. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable number of new apartments was scheduled to be completed in the period ahead.
In the established housing market, a number of indicators suggested that conditions had eased in Sydney, but to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Housing price growth had slowed over 2017 in Sydney, but had remained strong in Melbourne. A similar pattern was evident in auction clearance rates, which had declined by more in Sydney than in Melbourne. Auction volumes had also remained relatively low in Sydney. Rent increases had remained low in most cities and rents had continued to decline in Perth.
Members noted that the national accounts for the June quarter would be released the day after the meeting and that an increase in the quarterly growth rate of GDP was likely. Solid growth in retail sales suggested that household consumption growth was likely to have risen in the June quarter. However, retailers had discounted prices to achieve sales, which meant that growth in nominal retail sales had been more modest.
Non-mining business investment was expected to have increased in the June quarter, based on recent data. Forward-looking indicators such as capacity utilisation and investment intentions from business surveys suggested a further pick-up was in prospect, consistent with the Bank's forecast for growth in non-mining investment to strengthen gradually. Non-residential building approvals had picked up strongly over preceding months and non-mining investment intentions for 2017/18 reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey had been revised upwards. The data still pointed to modest growth at best, but the survey covers only around half of non-mining investment; growth in investment in the other parts of the non-mining sector, such as education and health, had been stronger.
Mining investment was expected to have declined in the June quarter and the capital expenditure survey pointed to a further, but moderate, fall in 2017/18 as expected. Members noted that strength in public investment was expected in the subsequent couple of years, driven by the program of current and planned infrastructure projects.
Members also noted that profits in the mining sector had remained high, in line with commodity prices, despite a decline in the June quarter, and that profits in the non-mining sector had strengthened over the year to the June quarter, following earlier weakness.
Turning to global economic developments, members noted that conditions in the world economy had remained positive, although inflation pressures remained subdued.
Members noted that GDP growth in the three largest advanced economies had picked up in the June quarter, driven by faster growth in business investment and continued strong consumption growth. Accommodative policy settings had helped sustain growth above estimates of potential for several years. The outlook for business investment had improved for all three economies and the outlook for growth in consumption remained positive in light of continued improvements in labour markets. Unemployment rates in the United States and Japan remained below estimates of full employment. Although spare capacity remained in the euro area labour market, unemployment rates had fallen in most countries and GDP per capita had been growing. Nevertheless, growth in wages had not increased materially in any of the major economies and core inflation remained low. In recent months, core inflation had been declining in the United States and Japan. Headline inflation rates had also declined, largely because of the earlier decline in oil prices.
In China, GDP growth had been a little stronger than expected over the first half of 2017, supported by generally accommodative policy settings. Strong growth in infrastructure investment had continued in July, and further sharp increases in crude steel production and electricity generation had continued to support imports of coal and iron ore from Australia. In the rest of east Asia, a pick-up in export growth as global demand strengthened had underpinned stronger domestic demand.
Members discussed the influence of China on the global iron ore and steel markets more generally. They noted that China was by far the largest consumer and importer of iron ore globally. This reflected the fact that China, with the world's largest population, had reached a similar level of steel production per capita to that of industrialised economies. Iron ore prices had been supported at higher levels because of sustained strong demand for steel in China. However, prices were expected to fall in the period ahead because of the ongoing expansion of global iron ore supply following an extended period of strong investment. Members also noted that Chinese steel production per capita was likely to be close to its peak and that growth in Chinese steel production would not add much to global demand for iron ore in the future. Members observed that, in the longer run, there was potential for India to have a noticeable effect on commodity markets as investment in residential construction and transport infrastructure increased.
Members discussed the challenges facing the Chinese authorities as they balance their commitment to short-term growth targets with their efforts to address medium-term risks arising from high and rising levels of debt in the Chinese economy. Members also discussed the Chinese authorities' progress in implementing structural reforms announced in 2013 at the Third Plenum. There had been progress on a number of fronts, including a broadened value added tax, some deregulation of interest rates and the relaxation of the one-child policy. However, the authorities' goal of allowing the market to play a ‘decisive role’ in allocating resources was still some way from being realised. In particular, state-owned enterprise reform had been focused on strengthening these firms and increasing the oversight of their activities by the Chinese Communist Party, rather than reducing the influence of state-owned firms in the economy. Members noted that the outcome of the 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in mid October would affect the pace and focus of further reforms, and influence how the authorities address the tension between achieving short-term growth aims and managing the build-up of risks to financial stability associated with rising debt levels.
Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that there had been a muted response in markets to rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Overall conditions in financial markets had remained very accommodative and volatility had remained low over the preceding month.
Long-term government bond yields in the major financial markets had generally declined over the preceding month. US Treasury bond yields had reached the lowest level since the US election, in part reflecting continued uncertainty about the implementation of the administration’s policy agenda and lower-than-expected inflation data. While the Federal Reserve was widely expected to commence its balance sheet reduction later in 2017, market pricing indicated that the federal funds rate was not expected to be increased until the second half of 2018. Members noted that yields on US government bills that mature in early October had increased, reflecting concerns that US legislators might not raise the US debt ceiling in time to meet funding requirements.
The yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had changed little over the preceding month. The spread of Australian 10-year government bonds to US Treasuries had widened over recent months, which was also the case for spreads to US Treasuries of a number of other sovereign bonds.
Major share markets had declined a little over the preceding month, in part reflecting rising geopolitical tension.
Major market corporate bond spreads to sovereign bonds were around their lowest levels since the onset of the global financial crisis and overall funding conditions for companies remained favourable.
In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated a little further in trade-weighted terms over the preceding month to be lower than before the US election. However, it was still well above levels at the end of the period of expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in 2014. In trade-weighted terms, the Japanese yen and the euro had been little changed over August, with the latter having appreciated over preceding months to be around late-2014 levels. The Australian dollar was little changed over August, in both US dollar and trade-weighted terms. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the course of 2017 had, in large part, reflected a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar.
In China, tighter enforcement of capital controls by the authorities had contributed to a reduction in capital outflows in 2017 and had been accompanied by an appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar. Bond yields had also increased since the end of 2016 in line with some tightening in financial conditions. Members observed that financial market conditions in China nevertheless remained accommodative overall.
In Australia, growth in housing credit had remained steady during 2017; slower growth in lending to investors had been offset by stronger growth in lending to owner-occupiers. Members observed that, while growth in housing lending by the major banks had slowed over 2017, growth in housing lending by smaller lenders had increased. This partly reflected the response of the major banks to the measures introduced by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) earlier in the year in relation to interest-only lending, which makes up a larger share of lending by major banks than by other lenders. Members also noted that loan approvals for new dwellings had continued to increase over 2017.
Average lending rates were estimated to have increased slightly over 2017, reflecting higher interest rates for investors and borrowers with interest-only loans. Members noted that the average interest rate on new variable-rate loans was estimated to be around 30 basis points below that on outstanding loans.
Overall, major banks' funding costs were estimated to have declined gradually over 2017. Combined with the increase in average lending rates, the implied spread between the average outstanding lending and funding rates for banks was estimated to have edged higher over 2017. Also, spreads for Australian residential mortgage-backed securities had declined over the prior year and issuance had been strong relative to the average of the post-financial crisis period.
Profits reported by Australian listed companies in August had generally increased compared with a year earlier, although they had been somewhat below expectations. Share prices across the major sectors were higher than a year earlier, particularly for resource companies, reflecting higher commodity prices.
Financial market pricing had continued to indicate that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged throughout 2017, with some expectation of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018.
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the data received over the prior month confirmed that global economic conditions had strengthened since 2016. Labour markets had continued to tighten and above-trend growth was expected in a number of advanced economies. Growth in wages and inflation had generally remained subdued and core inflation had eased a little. In China, continued strong growth in infrastructure investment had supported demand for commodities, although medium-term risks associated with high and rising debt levels remained.
Conditions in global financial markets had generally remained very accommodative; long-term bond yields in the major financial markets had declined and volatility had been low. No further monetary easing was expected in the major economies and the US Federal Reserve was expected to raise the federal funds rate further in the period ahead.
Members noted that the Australian economy had grown at a below-trend rate over 2016/17. The data on domestic activity received over the prior month had, on balance, been positive and consistent with a gradual pick-up in growth as forecast. Members noted that conditions had been conducive to a pick-up in non-mining investment for some time and the latest data on investment expectations pointed to this occurring, which was a welcome development. The decline in mining investment was diminishing and strength in public infrastructure investment was expected. Residential investment appeared to have passed its peak, but was expected to remain at a high level for some time.
Employment growth had been broadly based across the states, suggesting that the adjustment to the end of the mining investment boom was nearing completion. Solid growth in employment was expected to continue, which would support household incomes and thus spending in the period ahead. Members acknowledged the risks to this scenario from growth in housing debt having outpaced the slow growth in household incomes over the preceding few years. Growth in wages and inflation had remained low but stable. This was expected to remain the case for some time. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in growth in wages and inflation was expected as the spare capacity in the labour market was reduced and the economy continued to strengthen, supported by the low level of interest rates.
The appreciation of the Australian dollar over recent months, driven in part by a broad depreciation of the US dollar, was weighing on domestic growth and contributing to subdued inflationary pressure. A further appreciation of the Australian dollar would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in growth and inflation.
Members noted that conditions in established housing markets had continued to vary considerably. There had been clearer signs of an easing in conditions in the Sydney market but less so in Melbourne, where prices had continued to grow strongly. Borrowing for housing had continued to outpace growth in incomes, although the composition had shifted towards owner-occupiers, with higher interest rates for investors in housing reflecting the ongoing effects of APRA’s recent measures to strengthen lending standards in this area.
Taking into account all of the available information, and the need to balance the risks associated with high household debt in a low-inflation environment, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate likely held near an 18-year low through mid-September, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Monday, sparking bets that it may end the year below the central bank's target.
Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index probably rose 2.60 percent in the twelve months through mid-September, according to the median of 24 forecasts in the poll. 
That would be the lowest mid-month reading since 1999, when Brazil adopted its current inflation-targeting regime, though a tad above the 2.46 percent rate at the end of last month.
Economists at UBS see ""growing risks"" that inflation will be below the bottom end of the central bank's 2017 target range of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. Even the highest forecast in the September poll lagged far behind that level, at 2.73 percent, with the lowest at 2.49 percent.
The central bank has missed its inflation target three times in the last two decades, but has never undershot it.
That could give it reason to slow the pace of interest rate cuts slightly when it meets again in October, after signaling a gradual end to monetary easing earlier this month.
Interest rate futures suggest traders are mostly betting on a 75 basis-point cut, with some bets on a 50 basis-point reduction. 
An unanticipated decline in food prices allowed the central bank to cut the benchmark Selic rate by 100 basis points in each of its last four policy meetings, providing support to Latin America's largest economy as it exited its deepest recession in a century.
Still, economists said the economic recovery is too incipient to generate substantial price pressures despite recent signs of strength in the labor market. Services inflation, which is closely tied to demand, is expected to remain muted.
The IPCA-15 index likely rose 0.15 percent from the previous month, a smaller increase than the 0.35 percent monthly rise for mid-August, as the impact of a fuel tax hike faded. The 25 estimates ranged from 0.05 percent to 0.28 percent. 

The data will be released on Thursday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT), one hour after the central bank offers additional insight in its quarterly inflation report.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2017 08:11AM ET</span>",Skilled labor shortage clouds U.S. building industry outlook: survey,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Contractors for U.S. commercial construction are optimistic about the industry's health in the next 12 months though finding skilled labor still poses challenges, according to a third-quarter survey released on Monday.
Ninety-five percent of 206 respondents expect revenue to grow or remain stable over the next 12 months, the survey by  USG Corp  (N:USG) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed.
Ninety-three percent expect profit margins to stay the same or increase in the next 12 months, a sign of healthy contractor sentiment, the survey conducted July 12-19 showed.
In a potential sign that the U.S. economy may weaken, 53 percent of contractors expect to employ more workers in the next six months, down from 66 percent in the second quarter. This aligns with other studies that show a strong market, but with some tempering of projected growth, the report said.
However, 54 percent of contractors express a high degree of confidence in opportunities for new business over the next 12 months, while 97 percent have at least moderate confidence.
The survey shows strong optimism about the construction industry's prospects but skilled labor shortages and its impact on the industry need to be addressed, said Jennifer Scanlon, president and chief executive of USG Corp, in a statement.
Results from three gauges of confidence in the commercial construction industry – order backlogs, the pipeline for new business and revenue forecasts - comprise the Commercial Construction Index, which scored 73 in the third quarter, within three points of the two previous surveys.
The survey was started earlier this year to review the financial health and construction outlook for the five traditional commercial property sectors of office, retail, hotel, large apartment and warehousing, as well as other types of buildings, such as government and transportation.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's new home prices rose in August at the slowest pace in seven months and fell or leveled off in more cities as government cooling measures dampened speculation, though there were no signs of a sharper correction that could damage the economy.
Signs of a more stable and less frothy housing market, which is a key driver of economic growth, will be good news for the Communist Party as it prepares for a key meeting next month.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.2 percent in August, half the pace of the previous month, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Monday.
It's the first time in three years that prices in the 15 hottest markets singled out by the NBS - mostly mega-cities and provincial capitals - have all stopped rising on a monthly basis after nearly six months of intensified controls, analysts noted.
""The turning point for Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities has emerged,"" Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based senior analyst at property agency Centaline, wrote in a note.
The Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese property developers jumped after the news. 
China's top three developers by sales,  Country Garden  (HK:2007),  China Vanke  (HK:2202) and China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) rose 4.28 percent, 0.4 percent and 4.3 percent respectively as of 0300 GMT.
""The data made investors a little more comfortable,"" said Conita Hung, investment strategy director of Gransing Securities Co Ltd. 
""The market was worried that China might step up tightening if home prices continued to rise … Now it was showed that the policies in place are effective and there's less worry over further tightening."" 
Over the last year, more than 45 major cities have imposed restrictive policies of varying severity to curb fast-rising prices, with some forced into several rounds of tightening measures.
The steps have started to take some heat out of the market as sales growth has slowed from peak levels seen at the start of the year, but buyer demand appeared to be more resilient than expected.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported a monthly price increase for new homes, although the number dropped to 52 in August from 61 in July.
Southern boomtown Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, saw prices fall 1.9 percent from a year earlier, the first annual fall since March 2015, while its monthly decline further deepened to 0.4 percent from July's 0.2 percent. 
Prices in Shanghai and Beijing rose 2.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, from a year earlier, but were unchanged on a monthly basis. 
However, the latest data showed that speculators are continuing to move into smaller cities with fewer controls.
Guilin, a smaller Tier-3 city in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was the top price performer in August, rising 1.1 percent. 
New home prices in Tier-3 cities rose a faster-than-average 0.4 percent in August, but slowed from the 0.6 gain percent in July, the NBS said in a note accompanying the data.
Analysts say China's property market may become even more polarised in the next few months as falling inventories of finished homes could drive up prices in smaller cities, especially when the market enters the ""Golden September, Silver October"" peak sales season.
Nearly a third of Chinese households believe housing prices will keep rising in the coming quarter, despite state moves to cool down the market, a survey by China's central bank showed on Friday.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect China's home prices to rise faster in 2017 than previously estimated despite the flurry of new government curbs introduced this year.

Compared with a year earlier, August new home prices rose 8.3 percent nationwide, decelerating from July's 9.7 percent gain, according to Reuters calculations based on the NBS survey.

IHS Markit said its monthly Household Finance Index fell to 42.8 in September from 43.4 in August though above a three-year low of 41.6 seen in July.
Looking at the third quarter as a whole, the index's average reading is its lowest since 2014.
British households have been pinched by fast-rising inflation since last year's Brexit vote and weak rises in wages.
Monday's survey showed the amount of cash available to spend continued to fall at one of the steepest rates seen over the past three years. 
""With the Bank of England sounding increasingly eager to start hiking interest rates, the prospect of higher borrowing costs and increased mortgage payments is likely to hit households further,"" Tim Moore, a director at IHS Markit, said.
Last week the BoE said it expected to raise interest rates in the coming months if inflation pressure continued to build, surprising many investors.
The IHS Markit survey showed households were also likely to be taken by surprise by the BoE's change of tone. Only 29 percent of respondents expected a rate rise over the next six months, and just 12 percent before the end of the year, IHS Markit said.

The survey of 1,500 people was conducted between Sept. 6 and 11, before the Sept. 14 announcement by the BoE.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>",Food price inflation eases in Qatar after leap due to sanctions,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Food price inflation eased in Qatar during August, government data showed on Saturday, suggesting the country was finding ways to reduce the impact of economic sanctions imposed by other Arab states.
Food prices jumped after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, closing Qatar's land border with Saudi Arabia - across which many perishable goods had been imported - and disrupting maritime shipping routes.
Food and beverage prices climbed 4.5 percent from a year earlier in July, their fastest increase since at least 2014, and shot up 4.2 percent from the previous month.
In August, however, food and beverage prices only rose 2.8 percent from a year ago and fell back 0.6 percent from July, suggesting Qatar had succeeded in establishing new channels to obtain food economically.
Qatari shipping lines, which lost the use of Dubai as a trans-shipment center because of the sanctions, have been establishing new services via Oman, Kuwait and the Indian subcontinent. Qatari food processors have boosted their operations to make up for the disruption to imports.
Saturday's data showed the sanctions were still having a major impact on Qatar's real estate market, however, by hurting business sentiment and prompting some investors from other Arab states to offer their properties for sale.
Housing and utility prices sank 4.0 percent from a year earlier in August, their biggest drop for at least several years, and fell 0.4 percent from the previous month. In July, they had slipped 3.6 percent from a year ago.

Qatar's overall consumer price index dropped 0.4 percent from a year earlier in August, its first fall since at least early 2015, when the current data series began.

It could have been worse.
Wholesale prices of pork bellies surged to over $200 per hundredweight in July after starting the year at roughly $116, caused by stronger-than-expected consumer demand and tight supply, according to government data and industry watchers.
But consumers did not feel the pinch sooner because it usually takes about six weeks for changes in belly prices to be seen at the supermarket, industry experts said.
From December 2016 through most of 2017, storage of pork bellies in public, private and semi-private cold storage warehouses stayed at record lows, even as U.S. farmers took advantage of lower feed prices to build the domestic hog herd to record highs, according to industry and government data.
When U.S. consumer demand did not ease and retail prices remained steady, the industry found itself in a short-term supply quandary, said Doane Advisory Services economist Dan Vaught.
""I really would have thought the industry would have been more aggressive in storing bellies for use this summer, which obviously wasn't the case because the amount in product in storage really lagged historical levels pretty badly all year,"" Vaught said.
""When end-users needed those bellies they weren't there, despite the record production overall for summer, so we ended up with a shortage.""
Wholesale U.S. pork belly prices hit their highest ever of $227.54 per cwt (or $2.28 per pound) on July 26, before sinking to the lowest for the year on Friday, to $101.63 per cwt, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
As summer progressed, shoppers started to see the ripple effect. The average August retail bacon price reached an all-time peak of $6.24 per pound, up 7.3 percent from July and 14.5 percent higher than the year-ago period, according to USDA retail price data released this week.
What goes up must come down, said food and livestock analysts. The retail bacon price spike dampened consumer and food service sales. That, in turn, has sent wholesale pork belly prices falling about 50 percent in the past few weeks, said Steve Meyer, a pork analyst at Indiana-based EMI Analytics.

""That pushback is the primary reason that belly primal prices are now at $104 per cwt,"" Meyer said. ""These low wholesale values will encourage storage and attract end users back when the pricing is eventually passed along.""

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 01:03PM ET</span>","Hurricane Harvey slams U.S. retail sales, industrial output","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in August and industrial output recorded its biggest drop since 2009 as Hurricane Harvey disrupted activity, suggesting the storm could dent economic growth in the third quarter.
Harvey, which lashed Texas in the last week of August, also has impacted the labor market. Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida last weekend, also is likely to hurt the economy, though analysts expect a rebound in the fourth quarter.
""The early returns from Harvey are trickling in and the news is not good,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Economists are likely marking down third-quarter growth and marking up the fourth quarter.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month, the biggest decline in six months as motor vehicle sales tumbled 1.6 percent. Sales of building materials, electronics and appliances as well as clothing also fell.
While noting that it could not isolate the impact of Harvey on retail sales, the department said it received indications from companies that the hurricane had ""both positive and negative effects on their sales data while others indicated they were not impacted at all.""
Though Harvey likely depressed retail sales last month, data for July and June were revised down, suggesting a moderation in consumer spending after brisk growth in the second quarter.
Economists had forecast retail sales nudging up 0.1 percent in August. While last month's drop in motor vehicle sales was the largest in seven months, the replacement of flood-damaged vehicles, especially in the Houston area, is expected to deliver a boost.
Overall retail sales increased 3.2 percent in August on a year-on-year basis. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 0.2 percent last month after an unrevised 0.6 percent increase in July. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. That boosted GDP growth to a 3.0percent rate in the April-June period.
U.S. stocks inched up to record highs, while prices of U.S. Treasuries slipped. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies (DXY).
'WALKING WOUNDED'
In a separate report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said industrial production declined 0.9 percent in August. That was the biggest drop since May 2009 and followed six straight monthly gains.
The Fed attributed about 0.75 percentage point of the decline to storm effects that ""temporarily curtailed drilling, servicing, and extraction activity for oil and natural gas.""
Economists expect industrial output to decline further in September, with Irma likely weighing on utilities.
""Food processing is also going to join the list of the walking wounded because South Florida grows and processes a lot of food,"" said Michael Montgomery, a U.S. economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Other data from the New York Fed on Friday showed its index of factory activity in New York state remained at lofty levels in September amid strong orders growth, indicating that manufacturing remains on solid ground apart from the storm-related distortions.
The weak retail sales and industrial output reports prompted the Atlanta Fed to slash its third-quarter GDP estimate to a 2.2 percent rate from a 3.0 percent pace.
The data, however, did little to change expectations that the Fed will announce a plan to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates again only in December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year. Despite sluggish wage growth, even as the labor market nears full employment, the fundamentals for consumer spending are solid. In addition to the strong stock market, house prices have continued to rise. 
Last month, sales at building material stores fell 0.5 percent after surging 0.9 percent in July. Clean-up and rebuilding in the aftermath of Harvey and Irma could buoy sales of building materials in September.
Receipts at service stations increased 2.5 percent in August, reflecting higher gasoline prices. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 0.7 percent and receipts at clothing stores dropped 1.0 percent after rising 0.5 percent in July. Sales at online retailers declined 1.1 percent in August, the biggest drop since April 2014. That was likely payback following a 1.8 percent surge in July, which was driven by Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime Day promotion.

Receipts at restaurants and bars rose 0.3 percent and sales at sporting goods and hobby stores edged up 0.1 percent.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>","Russian central bank cuts key rate to 8.5 percent, pledges more cuts","By Andrey Ostroukh and Jack Stubbs
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Central Bank lowered its main interest rate to 8.5 percent from 9 percent on Friday and said it expected to deliver more cuts in the next six months as inflation slows.
After putting monetary easing on halt in late July, the Central Bank has now embarked on a new rate-cutting cycle as inflation - its key area of responsibility - had weakened more than expected.
Unlike in previous statements, the central bank did not say that global geo-political risks along with fluctuations in the rouble posed upside risks for Russian consumer inflation.
""Taking into account a balance of risks for inflation, the Bank of Russia considers its possible to lower the key rate in the next half a year,"" said Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
""We will ease monetary policy smoothly,"" she said at a news conference where she explained the rationale for lower rates.
When asked about the scale of future moves, Nabiullina said the central bank was considering trimming the rate by 25 or 50 basis points, or putting it on hold.
""Despite the size of today's rate cut, the tone of the accompanying statement, as well as Ms. Nabiullina's press conference, was very cautious,"" Capital Economics research firm said in a note.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital said it now expects the central bank to cut rates by 25 basis points at each of the two remaining meetings this year, on Oct. 27 and Dec. 15.
Renaissance Capital said it sees the central bank leaving rates on hold next month, before slashing them by another 50 basis points before the end of the year.
Friday's cut was in line with market expectations and the fourth so far this year, bringing the key rate to its lowest since late 2014, down from 10 percent at the beginning of this year.
The central bank also revised its economic forecasts. Citing stronger consumer and investment demand, the regulator said it now expects gross domestic product to grow by up to 2.2 percent in 2017, up from its previous outlook for 1.3 to 1.8 percent.
With inflation risks subsiding, the central bank has an opportunity to lower the cost of borrowing to help underpin an economic recovery. Annual inflation slipped to 3.3 percent in August, below the bank's target of 4 percent.
While inflation is running at the lowest rate in the post-Soviet period, a level some analysts considered unattainable two years ago when annual price rises hovered near 17 percent, the central bank is still in the very early stages of securing price stability, Nabiullina said.
Nabiullina said the central bank still needs to ""anchor inflation expectations"", which could be done by 2019 when the bank's main rate could reach 6.5-7 percent.

The rouble hovered around 57.6 to the dollar on Friday , shrugging off the rate cut. This underpinned Nabiullina's statement that the central bank currently sees ""no risks for substantial fluctuations"" in the currency.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories rose 0.2 percent after an unrevised 0.5 percent increase in June.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Retail inventories slipped 0.1 percent in July instead of the 0.2 percent decline estimated last month. Retail inventories rose 0.6 percent in June.
Motor vehicle inventories were unchanged instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.2 percent as reported last month. They rose 0.5 percent in June.
Inventory investment had a neutral impact on the second quarter's 3.0 percent annualized growth pace after chopping off 1.46 percentage points in the first three months of the year.
Business sales increased 0.2 percent in July after a similar gain in June. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from June. Sales at retailers increased 0.3 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in the prior month.
The inventories-to-sales ratio for motor vehicles was 2.26 months in July, unchanged from June.

The preliminary publication of the data for September from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment dropped to 95.3 from 96.8 in the previous month.
Analysts had forecast the reading to fall to 95.1.
The current conditions indicator advanced to 113.9 in September, from the previous 110.9.
However, consumer expectations fell to 83.4 in September, from the prior reading of 87.7.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months held steady at 2.6%.
Chief economist Richard Curtin explained that the drop in the headline sentiment number was due to concerns over the outlook for the national economy after Hurricane Harvey and Irma and noted that the current conditions index hits its highest level since November 2000.
“Given the widespread devastation in Texas and Florida, it is not surprising to find these very negative initial reactions, nor would it be surprising if these negative assessments last longer than following most past hurricanes,” Curtin said.
He further noted that renewed gains in incomes as well as rising home and equity values have acted to counterbalance the negative impacts from the hurricanes and concluded that recent events were unlikely to derail confidence.

Overall industrial production fell 0.9 percent over the month after a July increase revised upward to 0.4 percent. 
The Fed, using a combination of high-frequency plant output data and economic modeling, attributed about 0.75 percentage point of the decline to storm effects that ""temporarily curtailed drilling, servicing, and extraction activity for oil and natural gas.""
Economists polled by Reuters had still expected a 0.1 percent increase in industrial output. The U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
Though Harvey was a major force in the decline, helping push down mining output by 0.8 percent, other sectors contributed.
The output of consumer goods fell 0.7 percent as a rise in production of consumer durables was offset by declines in non-durables and consumer energy products. Production of motor vehicles and auto parts rose 2.2 percent.
Utilization of factory capacity fell 0.8 percentage point to 76.1 percent, compared to a revised upward figure of 76.9 percent in July, nearly 4 percentage points below the long run average. 

Economists expected the storm to begin showing up in the output figures, but also in general feel those impacts will be offset by future increases.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>","Euro zone wage growth surges, making ECB taper more likely","By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone wages grew at their fastest rate in two years in the second quarter, data released on Friday showed, increasing the chances that the European Central Bank will set out plans next month to rein in its economic stimulus.
Hourly labor costs rose by 1.8 percent in the April-June period, from a revised 1.4 percent in the first quarter, its highest growth since the first quarter of 2016, EU statistics office Eurostat said.
Wages were 2.0 percent higher year-on-year in the second quarter from 1.3 percent in the first, the highest rate since the first quarter of 2015.
Weak consumer price inflation is a particular problem for the ECB. It has undershot its inflation target - close to but under 2 percent - for more than four years despite unprecedented stimulus and will not reach its goal before the end of the decade. The rate was 1.5 percent in August.
It is now debating whether to ease back on stimulus, a decision likely to come in October, accepting that more patience is needed to lift inflation. Capital Economics said the labor- cost data reinforced its view that the ECB would set out plans next month to taper its assets purchases in the first nine months of 2018.
The ECB is keeping a close eye on wages, hoping that robust economic growth and rapid job creation will finally push earnings higher and give inflation a badly needed boost.
ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note that seasonally adjusted data only showed growth in wages accelerated to 1.8 from 1.6 percent - not a sharp jump but at least an indication that economic improvements were leading prices to rise.
""With an important decision about tapering ahead in October, this will be a welcome sign that pipeline inflation pressures are at least improving,"" Colijn said.
Although employment has increased by nearly seven million since its trough in 2013, wage growth has been barely visible for years, a puzzling development for policymakers that suggests sizable hidden unemployment. 
It may also signal that globalization has diminished central banks’ control over inflation as supply, demand and labor markets become international.
Wage talks by IG Metall, - with 2.3 million workers, Germany’s biggest union - will be keenly watched by policymakers, since its agreement will influence wage setting across several key sectors in the euro zone’s biggest economy. The union will publish its initial demands in October, but no deal is expected until early next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence worsened for the first time in four months in September from the previous month's decade-high level and was expected to fall further, weighed by global uncertainty, a Reuters poll showed.
The monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan - found the service-sector mood had its best reading in more than two years, adding to recent signs of recovery in private consumption.
Compared with three months ago, the Reuters Tankan's sentiment indexes for manufacturers and service sector firms held largely unchanged, pointing to a steady reading in the central bank's upcoming tankan due on October 2.
Firm tankan results would support the BOJ's upbeat view on Japan's economy, which is expected to continue moderate growth after posting its sixth straight quarter of expansion through June.
The BOJ's last tankan showed big manufacturers' business confidence hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter.
However, the Reuters Tankan sentiment index was seen sliding over the next three months, reflecting uncertainty over the U.S. and Chinese economies - Japan's key trading partners - as well as risks such as North Korea's missile launches and nuclear weapons program.
""Our domestic clients are being cautious about capital spending due partly to anxiety about future prospects for Abenomics,"" wrote a manager of a machinery producer, referring to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary policy. ""Capital spending is being put off overseas as well due to uncertainty on the recovery prospects for Europe, America and China.""
Another machinery maker wrote in the survey, in which companies respond anonymously: ""While special demands for industrial equipment related to smartphones have subsided, sales of home apparatus are seesawing due to the murky global outlook.""
The sentiment index for manufacturers fell two points to 25 in September in the poll of 548 large- and mid-sized companies, conducted Aug. 30-Sept. 12, in which 268 firms responded. The index was down one point versus June, dragged down by producers of industrial materials such as oil and steel.
The Reuters Tankan service-sector index rose five points to 34, marking the best reading since June 2015, led by retailers and information and communications firms. The index has risen one point from three months ago.
The manufacturers' and service-sector indexes were expected to fall to 21 and 28 respectively in December.

""The domestic market is dwindling and consumption has not livened up with consumers tightening their purse strings,"" a manager at one manufacturer noted. ""It will take more time to shake off the deflationary mindset.""

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2017 12:08PM ET</span>","Gasoline, rents boost U.S. consumer inflation; weekly jobless claims fall","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices accelerated in August amid a jump in the cost of gasoline and rental accommodation, signs of firming inflation that boosted the probability of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve in December.
Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected drop in the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits last week. Though the data was impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the labor market remains healthy with increasing reports of worker shortages in some industries.
August's inflation readings support the views of some Fed officials that a cooling in price pressures in the past months was temporary.
""Today's report should ease some of the low inflation concerns among wavering Fed officials, and we continue to expect the leadership will prevail in getting another hike in at the December meeting,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in July. August's gain was the largest in seven months and lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent in July.
Economists had forecast the CPI rising 0.3 percent in August and climbing 1.8 percent year-on-year. 
The Labor Department said Harvey had a ""very small effect on survey response rates in August."" Gasoline prices surged 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since January, after being unchanged in July. Further increases are likely in September after Harvey forced temporary closures of some refineries on the Gulf Coast. 
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in August. The increase, which followed four straight monthly increases of 0.1 percent, was driven by a 0.4 percent jump in the cost of rental accommodation. Rents gained 0.2 percent in July.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent in August after advancing by the same margin in July. 
In the 12 months through August, the so-called core CPI rose 1.7 percent, increasing by the same margin for four straight months. While Fed officials are likely to treat the gasoline-driven rise in the CPI as temporary, they could take comfort in the pickup in the monthly core CPI.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The annual increase in the core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target since mid-2012. 
RATE HIKE CHANCES INCREASE
In the wake of the inflation data, the probability of a December rate hike increased to 50.9 percent from 41.3 percent on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks were largely unchanged after hitting record highs on Wednesday. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
Economists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
The Fed, however, is expected to delay until December its third rate increase this year because inflation remains low, despite the labor market being near full employment.
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 284,000 for the week ended Sept. 9.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market, for 132 consecutive weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. Economists had forecast claims rising to 300,000 in the latest week.
In addition to higher gasoline prices and rents, inflation in August was also lifted by increases in the cost of food, doctor and hospital visits, and prescription medication. 
Prices for apparel rose last month as did the cost of household furnishings, motor vehicle insurance and recreation.
""Inflation isn't dead,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""With this steady expansion of the economy in its ninth year bumping up against full employment this is just the time that inflation should start firming.""

But prices for used cars and trucks continued to fall as did the cost of mobile phone services. Price wars by mobile phone service providers have contributed to restraining inflation growth. Airline fares also dropped last month.

In the 12 months through August, the so-called core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for four straight months.
While Federal Reserve officials are likely to treat the gasoline-driven rise in the CPI as temporary, they could take comfort in the nearly broad gains in the monthly core CPI.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil expanded at a faster pace than expected in July, suggesting the economy got off to a solid start to the third quarter despite a string of mixed reports.
Economic activity rose 0.41 percent in July after seasonal adjustments. The median forecast in a Reuters poll indicated a 0.10 percent monthly advance in July.
The central bank also revised the previous month's reading to show a 0.55 percent increase, bigger than the originally reported 0.50 percent rise.
That should bring some solace to those worried that a nascent economic recovery may have hit a bump following tepid readings on retail sales and services activity.
Latin America's largest economy has been crawling out of the deepest recession in a century, which drove inflation to 18-year lows and allowed the central bank to cut interest rates to the lowest levels since 2013.
Slow price increases and low borrowing costs have stimulated consumer spending, which lifted second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth above analyst expectations.
Economists expect that to underpin a steady economic rebound going forward, but investments should recover slowly as companies prioritize cutting debt.

The central bank's activity index rose 1.48 percent from the year before, compared to a 0.8 percent increase in June.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2017 08:28AM ET</span>",Bank of England paves way for first rate hike in a decade,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said it was likely to raise interest rates in coming months if the economy and price pressures kept growing, flagging Britain's first rate hike in a decade.
Policymakers voted 7-2 on Thursday to keep rates on hold for now at a record-low 0.25 percent, as expected.
But in a week when data showed UK prices rising faster and unemployment falling to a four-decade low, they said their tolerance for above-target inflation was lessening.
The Brexit vote has put the BoE in a dilemma as it sought to balance the need to support the economy through the shock of leaving the European Union in March 2019 while also keeping a grip on fast-rising inflation.
It said that, if the trend towards shrinking spare capacity and rising underlying inflation continued, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months.""
Sterling leapt by a cent against the dollar after the statement and 10-year gilt yields increased by 4 basis points to 1.18 percent, their highest level since the BoE's last meeting on Aug. 3.
""I would describe (a rate hike in) November as being live,"" Nomura economist George Buckley said. 
But weaker than expected inflation or disappointing growth in jobs or wages could still throw the BoE off course, he added.
The BoE and its Governor Mark Carney have previously signalled the probability of rate hikes ahead, only to be caught out by unexpected changes in the economy.
On Thursday it said the economy was doing a little better than it had expected last month, and that inflation was likely to rise further above its 2 percent target to exceed 3 percent in October - slightly more than previous forecasts - after reaching 2.9 percent last month.
But it said it was ""unclear how sustained any increase in GDP growth might be over the medium term"", citing unknowns about how households and businesses would react to the Brexit process.
The BoE repeated a previous message that all nine MPC members thought rates could rise faster than financial markets expected but any increases would be gradual and limited.
MORE INFLATION-PRONE?
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected a 7-2 vote in favour of keeping the extra stimulus brought in August 2016 when the economy appeared to be reeling from the shock of the Brexit vote.
But a minority had seen a chance that BoE chief economist Andy Haldane would join Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in backing an immediate increase in rates to 0.5 percent.
Haldane - previously viewed as a dove - said in June that he expected to support a rate rise later in 2017. [nL8N1JI2WN]
After performing better than the BoE expected in 2016, Britain's economy slowed in the first half of 2017 as the highest inflation in four years squeezes consumer demand.
The central bank is concerned that Britain's ability to grow strongly over the medium term without generating excessive inflation has weakened.
It says the immediate surge in inflation above its target is due to the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.
Sterling fell to a nine-month low on a trade-weighted basis on Aug. 29, though it has since recouped these losses and is little changed from its level at the time of the BoE's last rate decision on Aug. 3.
This strengthening partly reflects growing market expectations of a rate rise. Short sterling interest rate futures price in a 44 percent chance of a move by the end of this year.
The pattern over recent years has been for such expectations to fade rapidly, however, and most economists polled by Reuters at the end of August did not expect a rate rise until 2019.
The BoE said that wage growth of 2.1 percent in the three months to July was stronger than it had expected, although it was still unclear if there would be the sustained pick-up it is forecasting. Unemployment at a 40-year low of 4.3 percent is also a more positive development than the BoE had expected.

There is no news conference following this month's policy decision. Carney is due to speak at the International Monetary Fund in Washington on Monday.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Swiss central bank ditches mantra on franc overvaluation,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank tempered its view of the Swiss franc's overvaluation on Thursday although analysts said the language shift should not be seen as heralding a departure from its ultra-loose monetary policy.
The Swiss National Bank retained its negative interest rates and said it remained ready to intervene in the currency markets to rein in the franc, whose soaring valuation it has long fought to restrain.
But in its quarterly policy assessment, the SNB ditched its nearly three-year mantra that the franc was ""significantly overvalued"", as foreseen by an Reuters poll before the interest rates decision.
Instead the central bank acknowledged the franc's weakening against the euro (EURCHF=) in recent weeks, which it said ""is helping to reduce, to some extent, the significant overvaluation of the currency"".
""The Swiss franc nevertheless remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile,"" the SNB said in a statement.
The franc weakened on the news, with the euro gaining 0.4 percent to trade at 1.1504 (EURCHF=), still below the 1.20 floor the SNB defended until January 2015.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said the central bank had not considered changing its policy, citing low inflation in Switzerland and a small interest rate differential to other countries.
""We see absolutely no reason for us to change our monetary policy at present,"" Jordan told Swiss broadcaster SRF.
Analysts said the language tweak should not be seen as a shift by the SNB, which has built up foreign currency reserves 10 percent bigger than Switzerland's total economic output during its campaign to weaken the franc.
Instead the change was recognition of the euro's nearly 5 percent rise against the franc since early July as Europe's economic recovery gathers momentum and political risks ease.
That has helped Swiss exporters, whose biggest foreign market is the neighboring euro zone.
SUBTLE CHANGE
""The change in the SNB's language was even more subtle than I thought it would be,"" said Karsten Junius, an analyst at J.Safra Sarasin. ""But they will trigger no change in actual SNB policy.""
Analysts from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), UBS and Zuercher Kantonalbank also expected no imminent change to SNB policy.
On Thursday, it kept its target range for the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at -1.25 to -0.25 percent and negative rates on sight deposits at -0.75 percent, as expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The SNB trimmed its GDP forecasts, although the weaker currency let it raise its inflation outlook.
The central bank is likely to remain cautious pending a consolidation of the franc's weakness.
The European Central Bank will also have to start reducing its own expansive policy before the SNB changes tack, said UBS analyst Alessandro Bee.
""When the ECB gets toward the end of reducing its asset purchase program that would probably lead to higher interest rates in the euro zone and allow the SNB to lift its own interest rates,"" Bee said.

The SNB would also want to see evidence that economic damage caused by the franc's surge over the last three years has been repaired. ""The data here has so far been mixed,"" said Bee.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",China’s economy losing some steam as investment growth hits 18-year low,"By Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - China posted a rare flurry of disappointing data on Thursday -- including its slowest growth in investment in nearly 18 years -- suggesting the world's second-largest economy is finally starting to lose some momentum as borrowing costs rise.
Factory output and retail sales also grew less than anticipated, though a rebound in property sales and construction starts is likely to keep China's overall growth relatively robust and comfortably on target ahead of a key leadership reshuffle next month.
""I think the risk (for China) isn't in the next couple of months but rather the next couple of years,"" said Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard.
""Progress on key structural reforms that really matter, such as boosting the performance of state-owned enterprises, has been quite slow and the structural drags on growth remain quite strong and are real risks.""
Analysts had widely expected China's August data to show industrial output and retail sales growth had accelerated after fading slightly in July, while investment was seen as only marginally softer.
That would have fit into a pattern of stronger-than-expected readings from China in the first half of the year and upbeat surveys on August factory activity.
A year-long, government-led construction boom has lifted demand and prices for everything from cement to steel to glass, helping offset an expected drag from property cooling measures and a regulatory crackdown on riskier types of financing.
But August's data suggested the strong boost from Beijing's infrastructure building spree may be starting to fade.
Fixed-asset investment, a key growth driver for the world's second-largest economy, grew 7.8 percent in January-August from a year earlier, the weakest pace since December 1999 and cooling from 8.3 percent in January-July.
The main drag appeared to be a slowdown in infrastructure investment due to a significant drop-off in government fiscal spending over the past two months, analysts said.
China frontloaded fiscal spending this year to produce rosy growth ahead of the once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress next month, Evans-Pritchard said. But local governments are constrained by annual budgets and have had to pare back spending in the second half of this year, he added.
That likely had a knock-on effect on industrial output, which rose 6.0 percent in August on-year, the weakest pace in nine months, statistics bureau data showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted output would grow 6.6 percent in August, up from 6.4 percent in July.
The statistics bureau said unusually hot and wet weather weighed on industrial output last month, adding that the economy remained on a steady, improving trend. On a monthly basis, output rose nearly half a percent.
China's crackdown on pollution may have also dented industrial output, as Beijing looks to close older, smog-belching mines and factories, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
Still, economists at Nomura maintained their view that the economy would expand 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, easing only slightly from 6.9 percent in the first half.
That would keep China on track to easily beat the government's full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent, even if there is some further softening late in the year.
PROPERTY
Overall investment may have softened further if not for an unexpected rebound in the property market, which directly affects 40 other business sectors in China.
Despite a series of government curbs which have largely succeeded in cooling red-hot housing prices, activity in the property market snapped back in August, possibly as developers turn their focus to smaller cities with fewer restrictions.
Property investment, which mainly focuses on residential real estate but also includes commercial and office space, grew 7.8 percent in August on-year, versus 4.8 percent in July, according to Reuters calculations from Thursday's data.
New construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developers' confidence, were up 5.3 percent after contracting in July for the first time since last September.
Growth of private investment slowed to 6.4 percent in January-August from 6.9 percent in the first seven months of the year, suggesting small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing investment-finance.
Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
RETAIL SALES ALSO MISS
Retail sales also confounded market expectations, rising 10.1 percent in August on-year, the slowest pace in six months and cooling from 10.4 percent in July. Analysts had expected a slight pick-up in demand.
Again, however, sales rose at a decent clip from a month earlier, and shoppers are expected to throng the stores and online sites as usual in October over the long Golden Week holidays.
Other data for August released last week was mixed, with imports beating expectations -- pointing to still solid domestic demand, while exports grew less than expected. Producer and consumer inflation quickened more than forecast.
Producer prices, particularly for building materials, have surged this year, giving China's long-ailing and heavily-indebted industrial sector its best profits in years. But some analysts said higher prices may also be skewing the data and exaggerating the strength of its economic recovery.
Foreign investment in China has remained tepid, though a sharp rebound in the yuan currency may be a game changer if sustained.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China fell 0.2 percent in the first eight months of 2017 from a year earlier to 547.94 billion yuan (63.38 billion pounds), Commerce Ministry data showed. But for August alone, it rose 9.1 percent.
China's outbound non-financial investment (ODI) slumped 41.8 percent in January-August from a year earlier as authorities continued to crack down on speculative outflows and ""irrational"" overseas asset purchases which had pressured the yuan.

Some acquisitive and high-profile Chinese firms have had to scrap plans for global acquisitions in recent months.

LONDON (Reuters) - House prices in central London fell at their sharpest pace since 2008 in August, intensifying the slowdown in the capital's housing market, but prices went up in other regions of Britain, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its monthly balance of overall British house prices picked up to +6 after dropping to a four-year low of +1 in July.
August's reading was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. But RICS said the reading was consistent with only a marginal rise in national prices.
Britain's housing market has slowed since the June 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union, when prices were rising by about 8 percent a year, compared with growth rates of about 5 percent now, according to official data.
Other measures from mortgage lenders have put the increase in house prices at about 2-3 percent a year.
London's prime central districts have borne much of the brunt of the slowdown, in part reflecting concerns about the impact of Brexit on the capital's financial services industry and other related sectors.
Also, prices in London have quadrupled over in the past 20 years, making homes unaffordable for many of its residents.
RICS said surveyors rated housing in London and southeast England, where prices also fell, as the most over-valued in Britain.
Fifty-six percent more surveyors in central London reported seeing a fall in prices than reported a rise, and it was the only region in Britain where prices were expected to fall over the next 12 months.
By contrast, RICS reported solid price growth in Northern Ireland, the north west and south west of England and Scotland.

However, the number of sales of properties across Britain continued to show no growth, a picture which began in November.

That compared with a budget deficit of $107 billion the same month one year earlier, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury reporting a $119.5 billion deficit last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $97 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $107 billion the prior year.
The deficit for the fiscal year to date was $674 billion, compared to $619 billion in the same period of fiscal 2016. On an adjusted basis, the fiscal-year-to-date deficit was $705 billion last month versus $619 billion in the year-earlier period.
Receipts last month totaled $226 billion, down 2 percent from one year ago, while outlays were $334 billion, a 1 percent decline from the same month a year earlier.
The decision last week by Congress to suspend the nation's debt limit through Dec. 8 eased pressure on the Treasury, which had been due to exhaust its borrowing capacity around the end of September.
Due to Treasury's ability to use emergency cash measures, the vote effectively suspended the issue until at least spring 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications jumped to their strongest level in 10 months last week despite hurricane-related disruptions seen in Texas and Florida, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Overall requests for loans to buy a home or to refinance one were stoked by cheap borrowing costs that hovered at their lowest levels since November.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted weekly index on mortgage activity climbed 9.9 percent, the biggest rise in 14 months, to 462.1 in the week ended Sept. 8. This was the highest reading since 480.5 in the week of Nov. 4, 2016.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dipped to 4.03 percent, the lowest since November, from previous week's 4.06 percent, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were anywhere from 4 basis points lower to 4 basis points higher than in the preceding week.
Borrowing costs were broadly near their lowest levels in nine months, buttressing demand for mortgages, the trade group’s data showed.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase mortgage activity, a proxy on future home sales, gained 10.9 percent to 252.0, which was the highest since June.
The group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage refinancing activity increased 8.9 at 1,636.8, the strongest level since November.
The share of refinancing requests versus total applications grew to 51.0 percent, the biggest since January 2017, from 50.9 percent a week earlier.
The overall strength in mortgage activity has offset the declines seen Texas and Florida.
“To illustrate the impact of the two major hurricanes, over the past two weeks, mortgage applications for the state of Texas ran about 25 percent lower than the state’s weekly average for the year to date, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Harvey."" MBA economist Joel Kan said.

""Additionally, in the most recent week we saw mortgage applications in Florida fall 48 percent lower than its 2017 weekly average, as many residents evacuated in anticipation of Hurricane Irma,"" he added.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 11:11AM ET</span>",Higher gasoline prices boost U.S. producer inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rebounded in August, driven by a surge in the cost of gasoline, and there were also signs of a pickup in underlying producer inflation.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in July. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 2.4 percent after advancing 1.9 percent in July.
Economists said the uptick in producer prices was unlikely to assuage Federal Reserve policymakers' concerns about low inflation as the increase was largely due to a 9.5 percent increase in the cost of gas. That was the largest rise since January and followed a 1.4 percent decline in July.
Though gas prices could rise further in September in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which disrupted oil refinery production in Texas, a reversal was expected because of ample crude supplies.
""Energy price gains, which will likely dominate the September inflation reports in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, will likely be viewed as having a temporary impact on inflation by the Fed,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  
Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3 percent last month and accelerating 2.5 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in July. The so-called core PPI increased 1.9 percent in the 12 months through August after a similar gain in July.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes were little changed after hitting record highs on Tuesday.
EYES ON INFLATION
Inflation is being closely watched for clues on the timing of the next Fed interest rate increase. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
The Fed is expected to delay raising rates until December. 
August's consumer inflation report scheduled for release on Thursday is expected to show gasoline prices helped push up the Consumer Price Index by 0.3 percent after a 0.1 percent rise in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
Last month's increase in the PPI is unlikely to translate into a similar gain in the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. 
The annual increase in the core PCE has consistently undershot the central bank's 2 percent inflation target since mid-2012. The core PCE rose 1.4 percent in July, the smallest year-on-year increase since December 2015.
The cost of food fell 1.3 percent as wheat prices recorded their biggest drop since April 2008. The decrease in food prices last month was the largest since February 2015 and followed an unchanged reading in July. There were also declines in the prices of fresh vegetables, fruits and meat. 
Core goods prices rose 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in July. The cost of services edged up 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in July. A 1.7 percent surge in the cost of consumer loans accounted for more than half of the increase in the price of services last month.
The cost of healthcare services increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in July. 

""This morning's producer price gains for August are a step in the right direction,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at the Bank of the West in San Francisco. ""However, they are not yet quite as strong or as broad-based as the Federal Reserve would like to see to help push core consumer price inflation back up to the Fed's 2 percent target.""

1614,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Producer Prices Rise Less than Expected in July,"Investing.com – U.S. producer price inflation and its core reading increased less than expected in August, though inflationary pressures at the factory gate were on the rise, official data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased 0.2% last month, missing the forecast for a 0.3% gain and still bouncing back from a prior 0.1% drop.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.4% in August, slightly below expectations for a gain of 2.5% but higher than the 1.9% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, rose 0.1% in August, missing forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior month’s 0.1% decline.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 2.0% last month, below forecasts for a 2.1% increase but higher than the gain of 1.9% in July.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1985 from around 1.1977 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3282 from 1.3278 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 109.97 from 110.01 earlier.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>","UK pay growth stays weak, easing pressure on Bank of England","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's unemployment rate hit its lowest since 1975 but wages slipped further behind the cost of living, taking some of the urgency out of a Bank of England debate on when interest rates might rise.
But Wednesday's figures added pressure on the government to give more ground on public sector salaries, a day after Prime Minister Theresa agreed to ease seven years of pay constraints for some state workers but not others.
The BoE issues a policy statement on Thursday.
The fall in the jobless rate to 4.3 percent in the three months to July, when Britain created jobs faster than at any time since 2015, might embolden the minority of the bank's policymakers who are pressing the case for an early hike in borrowing costs.
But wages rose by a modest 2.1 percent, missing forecasts of 2.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists and adding to other signs of weakness in the economy after last year's Brexit vote.
Sterling fell on the data as markets judged that the weak pay figures reduced the chance of the BoE striking a more hawkish stance on Thursday.
""Lagging wages makes it more likely the Bank of England will look through rising inflation when it decides on interest rates this week,"" said Ed Monk of fund manager Fidelity International.
""Prices are rising above target, which creates the case for raising rates, but today's wage data suggests all is still not right in the economy.""
The rise in British inflation - which hit an annual 2.9 percent in August - is largely driven by the fall in the pound since last year's vote to leave the European Union. That has eroded households' purchasing power and led to a slowdown in consumer spending, the main driver of Britain's economy. 
In real terms, wages have been falling since April and dropped by an annual 0.4 percent in the three months to July.
Part of the weak wage growth reflects a seven-year policy of public-sector wage restraint to help cut government borrowing. 
Britain's government partially eased its grip on pay on Tuesday when it said it would no longer limit wage rises for police and prison guards to the 1 percent cap for the public sector. 
But it has made no extra money available, and public-sector trade unions are considering coordinated strike action to push for pay rises greater than inflation.
POLICY QUANDARY
The figures also complicate the debate for BoE policymakers over whether to support a rate rise at their monthly Monetary Policy Committee meeting later on Wednesday. The outcome of the meeting is due to be announced at 1100 GMT on Thursday.
While the current lack of wage growth suggests the current acceleration in inflation will fizzle out, the strong growth in hiring suggests a pick-up in pay might not be far off. 
Unemployment is below the level which the BoE expects to trigger faster pay growth. But it has been repeatedly wrong-footed before about how far British unemployment needs to fall without pushing up wages.
Last month just two MPC members backed a rate rise. A minority of economists expect BoE chief economist Andy Haldane will join them this week. 
This would leave the MPC split 6-3 against lifting rates from a record-low 0.25 percent but would boost expectations about a move when the BoE updates its forecasts in November.

Most economists do not expect a rate rise until 2019, and think inflation will move only a little higher before slowly fading next year as domestic economic growth is subdued by Britain's looming departure from the European Union.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 4.3% in July, from the previous month’s reading of 4.4%. That was its lowest level since 1975.
Analysts had expected no change to the jobless rate.
The claimant count decreased by a seasonally adjusted 2,800 in August, beating expectations for a gain of 600 people and following a decline of 2,900 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 4,200.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.1% in the three months to July, missing forecasts for a 2.3% rise and compared to the previous month’s gain which was also 2.1%.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Japan August wholesale prices rise at fastest pace in nine years,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly nine years in August as robust Chinese demand boosted commodity prices, offering glimmers of hope consumer inflation will accelerate toward the central bank's 2 percent target.
But some analysts warn the pick-up in wholesale inflation won't be strong enough to nudge companies into boosting retail goods prices.
""The rise was driven mostly by items affected a lot by global commodities prices,"" such as crude oil and metal goods, said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Inflationary pressure remains weak for items like machinery,"" he said, adding that wholesale inflation will likely peak around October.
Wholesale prices rose 2.9 percent in August from a year earlier, increasing for the eighth straight month and marking the fastest pace of growth since October 2008, Bank of Japan data showed on Wednesday.
The rise in the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price that firms charge each other for their goods and services, was roughly in line with a median market forecast for a 3.0 percent increase. The July gain was 2.6 percent.
The increase was driven largely by rising import prices of crude oil, scrap metal and other commodities on robust demand from China, the data showed.
Overall final goods prices - the prices of finished products charged to businesses - rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.
Domestic final goods prices, which loosely track the consumer price index, rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter thanks to robust exports and a long-awaited pick-up in private consumption.
But core consumer prices rose just 0.5 percent in July from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's elusive 2 percent target, as companies remain hesitant to pass along rising labor and raw material costs to households.
The BOJ has had to push back the timing for reaching its price target six times since it deployed its massive stimulus programme in 2013.

It now hopes consumer inflation will hit its target by March 2020, as signs of strength in the economy and a tight job market boost wages and give households more purchasing power, thereby allowing firms to hike prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. poverty rate fell for the second straight year in 2016 while median income rose to an all-time high of $59,000 as the economy made up ground lost during the 2007-2009 recession, federal government data released on Tuesday showed.
Median household income rose 3.2 percent from $57,200 a year earlier, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report. It surpassed the previous high of $58,665 in 1999 during the nation's record 10-year economic expansion, although the agency said the figures were not directly comparable because of methodology changes.
""Real median household income has finally completed its nine-year slog of digging out of the ditch,"" IHS Markit Executive Director Chris Christopher said, with more gains expected in 2017 and 2018. 
Asked about the income jump, Census officials pointed to a rise in the number of people working more hours and more often even as wages appeared flat.
""We found that the earnings of households in middle .... their earnings were up. But we also saw a big jump in number of people working and the number of people working full-time year round,"" said Trudi Renwick, an assistant division chief for Census, adding: ""Median earnings for full-time, year-round workers was flat relative to last year.""
At the same time, the agency said last year's official U.S. poverty rate was about where it was before the recent U.S. recession. The 12.7 percent poverty rate in 2016 was a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 13.5 percent in 2015, it said. It was 12.5 percent in 2007. 
More than 40.6 million people in the United States were living in poverty last year, 2.5 million fewer than in 2015 and 6.0 million fewer than in 2014, Census said.
The number of poor decreased for most demographic groups except seniors, the only group that saw an increase, it added.
The official poverty rate varies depending on household size and income. For example, in 2016, a family of four with two adults and two children with a household income of $24,339 or less, two adults with $16,543 or less, or someone aged 65 or older with $11,511 or less would all be considered to be living in poverty. 
Additionally, Census said the supplemental poverty measure was 13.9 percent. That metric factors in various expenses and regional differences in the cost of living as well as the support the poor might receive from government programs.
The bureau also said 28.1 million people in the United States, or 8.8 percent, lacked health insurance coverage in 2016 compared with 29 million, or 9.1 percent, in 2015.
Despite the gains, some experts said more could be done.

Sheldon Danziger, head of the Russell Sage Foundation poverty research group, said ""expanding the earned income tax credit ... and more spending on badly needed infrastructure and early childhood education"" would lift employment and productivity.

The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed the labor market continued to tighten amid a scarcity of workers.
The strong labor market fundamentals could encourage the Federal Reserve to continue tightening monetary policy this year despite inflation persistently running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.
""Employers need skilled labor and experienced workers are in short supply, which continues to suggest the economy has returned to a relatively normal labor market that does not need exceptional support from the Fed,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 54,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million. That was the highest level since the data series started in December 2000. Job openings have now been above 6 million for two straight months.
Hiring increased 69,000 to 5.5 million in July, lifting the hiring rate to a near 1-1/2-year high of 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in June.
Labor market tightness was also underscored by another report from the National Federation of Independent Business.
The NFIB survey showed a record share of small businesses in August ranked difficulties finding qualified workers as ""their top business problem."" The rise in job vacancies in July bolsters views that August' s moderation in job gains was largely because of a seasonal quirk.
SOLID SHAPE
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 jobs last month, with the private services sector hiring the smallest number of workers in five months. Job growth in September could, however, be held back by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida, respectively.
The two states account for about 14 percent of U.S. employment. Temporary unemployment as a result of flooding from Harvey has already caused a surge in first-time applications for jobless benefits.
""The JOLTS data signal that the labor market was in solid shape in July and support our view that we should not be very concerned about the modest disappointment in the August payroll report,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
JOLTS is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's dashboard. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting.
Benign inflation amid sluggish wage growth, however, suggests the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.
Job openings in transportation, warehousing and utilities increased 70,000 in July and educational services had an additional 26,000 vacancies. There were 20,000 more job openings in construction.
Manufacturing, however, saw a 29,000 drop in vacancies in July. Health care and social assistance job openings decreased 72,000 and federal government vacancies declined 21,000.
About 3.2 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in July, up from 3.1 million in June. The quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, rose to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in June.
""One of the problems facing firms is that workers are still pretty much locked into their current positions,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With companies unwilling to bid for workers from other firms, there is little reason to leave and that is limiting the availability of qualified workers.""

Layoffs fell 23,000 to 1.78 million in July.

The survey by the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), which polled about 550 brokers, also showed the outlook was more reserved than in the first quarter for commercial leasing, residential rentals and commissions from renting. 
The readings are part of REBNY's six main indexes of current and future broker confidence in residential and commercial real estate, all of which remain in positive territory.
But the quarterly survey conducted in July showed expectations both for the residential rental and commercial leasing markets have slipped below four on an index format of zero to 10. A reading of five or above is positive.
REBNY's indexes have been roughly flat over the past year after hitting highs above eight between 2013 and 2015. Commercial broker expectations ticked up in the second quarter while the residential broker outlook edged down. Both remained positive.
While the city's strong property market has turned cautious, expectations for financing remain high. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, a benchmark in commercial real estate, hovered just above 2 percent last week.
The main components of the survey have been positive since 2013, when it began, as New York real estate boomed and the city enjoyed a strong economy with declining unemployment. 
Comments from the eight-question survey indicated a market in which buyers were hesitant and sellers were unrealistic on pricing.

Expectations for the commercial leasing market, looking six months ahead, were indexed at 3.78, down 1.01 points since the first quarter, according to REBNY. The future rental market was indexed at 3.31, a decrease of 0.51 points. Both were four-year lows.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's consumer price inflation rose more than expected to a five-month high in August, fueled by strong gains in prices of food items, dampening chances of a rate cut by the central bank in a policy review next month amid weak economic growth.
India's consumer price index (CPI)  rose 3.36 percent in August from a year earlier, data released by the Ministry of Statistics on Tuesday showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected CPI inflation would edge up to 3.20 percent, compared with 2.36 percent in July. 
Last month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent, the lowest since 2010, while keeping its policy stance at ""neutral"".
Analysts said a rise in inflation for two straight months has reduced the chances of another rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, which has a central inflation target of 4 percent. 
""We are of the opinion that RBI will not deliver any rate cut this calendar year,"" said Hitesh Jain, an analyst at IIFL Wealth Management.
The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the central bank had warned prices could start accelerating soon, reflecting caution, despite pressure to cut more aggressively after consumer inflation remained below its central target since October. 
Inflation had eased to 1.46 percent in June – its slowest pace since India started releasing retail inflation figures in January 2012, based on combined data for rural and urban consumers. 
Separately, annual industrial output  grew at 1.2 percent in July, in line with the forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the data showed.
Industrial output contracted 0.2 percent in June.
Asia's third largest economy slowed to a three-year low in the three months to June, delivering a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces criticism for disrupting business activity with his shock cash squeeze last year. 
LOWER FOOD OUTPUT
India's food grain production is expected to fall this year following a decline in areas under plantation, following unfavorable weather conditions in some states. 
Seasonal monsoon rains have caused damage to some crops and hit movement of goods.
""Looking ahead, price pressures are set to rise further,"" said Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

Retail food inflation, which accounts for about 54 per cent of the consumer price index, rose 1.52 percent in August after prices contracted in the previous three months.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",UK inflation jump puts Bank of England back in spotlight on rates,"By William Schomberg and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation hit its joint highest in more than five years in August as households paid more for fuel and clothing, complicating the Bank of England's job this week of explaining why it is not raising interest rates.
The fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit vote helped drive the biggest rise in clothing prices since the consumer price index was launched in 1997, up by 4.6 percent in annual terms, and rising global oil costs also hit.
Consumer prices overall increased by 2.9 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, up from 2.6 percent in July and above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a rise of 2.8 percent.
That took the CPI back to its level in May.
Sterling hit a four-week high against the euro after the data as investors priced in a greater chance of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee raising interest rates for the first time since before the global financial crisis a decade ago, and British government bond prices fell.
Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, said the BoE had been expecting inflation of 2.7 percent in August and while no change in rates was likely this week, the inflation reading was a challenge for the central bank.
It is worried that uncertainty about Brexit will hurt the economy and has so far held off from raising rates to avoid adding to a slowdown in growth seen in the first half of 2017.
""I think it will be a real headache for the MPC at the moment,"" Hill said. ""Inflationary pressure is there but there is also evidence that consumers are having a tough time.""
PIPELINE PRESSURE
The BoE targets 2 percent inflation, but most of its policymakers have voted to keep rates at their all-time low of 0.25 percent as Britain prepares for the challenge of leaving the European Union in 2019.
The BoE said last month it expects inflation to reach about 3 percent in October, much of it due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.
A further recent fall in the pound against the euro is likely to keep pressure on British inflation for longer than the BoE forecast in August.
But Paul Hollingsworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said he expected inflation to peak at 3.1 percent in October.
""With mixed signals on the current strength of the economy and the majority of the Committee appearing to be comfortable with a temporary, exchange-rate driven pick-up in headline inflation, we don’t think that the MPC will be panicked into raising interest rates imminently,"" he said.
Tuesday's data hinted at some future price pressure as the costs of raw materials for manufacturers and of goods leaving factories increased slightly.
Factory gate prices rose by an annual 3.4 percent, the first increase in the rate since February.
Economists in the Reuters poll had expected growth of 3.1 percent.
Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 7.6 percent.

The ONS said excluding oil prices and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose by 2.7 percent, stronger than economists' expectations of 2.5 percent.

British consumer prices rose by 2.9% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, up from 2.6% in July. Economists had expected inflation to rise at a 2.8% rate last month.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation accelerated 0.6%, compared to estimates for a gain of 0.5% and following a decline of 0.1% in July.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.7% last month, the most since 2011. That was up from 2.4% in July and above forecasts for a reading of 2.5%.
The retail price index increased 3.9% in August, increasing from 3.6% a month earlier.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 5.1%, accelerating from an increase of 4.9% in July
The data underlined arguments for an immediate interest rate hike that a minority of policymakers supported at the last BOE decision.
GBP/USD shot up to 1.3250 from around 1.3205 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.9021 from 0.9056 earlier.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly valuable gauge as the Fed decides when to raise interest rates again, slumped despite predictions among respondents for a rise in gasoline prices. 
The New York Fed report showed that one-year-ahead inflation expectations were 2.49 percent in August, down from 2.54 percent in July, marking the weakest reading since January 2016. The three-year measure ticked down to 2.62 percent, from 2.71 percent a month earlier.
Both measures have generally declined since the survey began in mid-2013, reflecting the years in which most U.S. inflation measures have fallen short of the central bank's target. If the weakness persists, the Fed, which hiked rates twice this year, may put off its plans for another policy tightening by December.
Respondents - who were generally surveyed before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in late August - expected gas prices to rise by 4.1 percent a year from now, up from 3.0 percent a month earlier. 

The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

Annual urban consumer price inflation dipped to 31.9 percent year-on-year in August from 33.0 percent in July, the official CAPMAS statistics agency said on Sunday. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, decreased to 34.86 percent from 35.26 percent, according to the central bank.
Inflation soared in July to its highest since 1986 after the government cut fuel and energy subsidies. The cuts were a condition of a $12 billion, three-year loan program agreed last November with the IMF, which included subsidy cuts, tax increases and looser capital controls.
""I'd expected this to widen, because usually it takes a couple of months for the subsidy cuts to actually reflect on prices, but this is definitely positive,"" said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage in Cairo.
Import-dependent Egypt has been rattled by surging inflation after floating its currency last year. Since then, the Egyptian pound has roughly halved in value.
""There has been minimal appreciation of the pound. If it gets a little more sizeable, then we could actually see inflation cooling off even before November,"" Sandeep said.
The pound <EGP1=> traded around 17.65 pounds to the dollar on Sunday. It has strengthened marginally in recent weeks after hovering around 18 pounds just after the currency was floated.

The central bank raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points in a surprise move in July, seeking to ease the inflationary pressure, but has kept them steady since.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2017 05:04AM ET</span>",China August producer inflation jumps to four-month high as economy races along,"By Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation accelerated more than expected to a four-month high in August, fueled by strong gains in raw materials prices and pointing to strong, sustained growth for both factory profits and the economy.
Consumer inflation also quickened more than forecast to a seven-month high, amid signs that upstream price gains are trickling through, but analysts said price gains remain modest and there is little pressure on the central bank to tighten policy further. 
""The unexpected rise in both CPI and PPI suggests that there is little hope China's monetary policy could see some relaxation before the end of this year,"" Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""We believe that the market has underestimated the inflationary pressure facing China's economy, although inflation is unlikely to surge in the foreseeable future. That said, onshore rates are still on the rise,"" he said, referring to higher financing costs.
China's producer price index (PPI) rose 6.3 percent in August from a year earlier, from 5.5 percent in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer inflation would edge up to 5.6 percent, its first pickup in six months.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.9 percent.
The price data added to a long list of upside surprises for the world's second-largest economy this year, which has so far defied analysts' expectations of a slowdown.
A year-long, government-led construction boom, a resilient property market and a recovery in exports have offset the expected drag from a regulatory crackdown on riskier types of financing, which is slowly driving up borrowing costs.
""The pickup in PPI shows that demand remains steady, and we expect third-quarter economic growth to remain steady from the first half,"" said Zhang Yiping, an economist at Merchants Securities in Shenzhen.
With the industrial sector in high gear, the economy grew by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
If activity remains relatively solid in coming months, China's economic growth could accelerate for the first time in seven years in 2017. Last year's pace of 6.7 percent was the slowest in 26 years.
""MAN OF STEEL""
China's industrial firms have been posting their strongest profits in years as the building boom fuels demand and prices for everything from cement and steel to glass and copper wiring.
Its commodities futures markets have rallied hard and continued to surge through August, boosted by strong restocking demand and government pledges to shut inefficient and highly polluting mines and plants, which has underscored concerns over tight supply heading into winter.
Activity in China's steel industry expanded in August at the fastest pace since April 2016, reflecting high levels of production and low inventory. 
Prices of ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industries jumped 29.1 percent in August on-year while prices of non-ferrous metal sectors grew 16.3 percent, and prices of the oil processing sector rose 16.8 percent, the latest data showed.
However, some analysts say rising prices have mainly benefited state firms which dominate upstream industries, while smaller companies further along the supply chain have been burdened by sharply higher raw materials costs.
Likewise, some economists say sharply higher commodity prices are also flattering China's import data, possibly exaggerating the strength of domestic demand. Imports rose 13.3 percent in August, more than expected, data showed on Friday.
And, it still seems too early to tell if suddenly cash-rich ""smokestack"" industries are putting the money to use by paying down massive levels of debt, an issue that Beijing has made a top priority this year as it looks to contain financial risks.
GRADUAL SPILLOVER INTO CONSUMER PRICES
China's strong appetite for resources such as iron ore has helped fuel a reflationary pulse in the manufacturing sector worldwide, producing synchronized growth in many developed and developing economies alike.
But despite the country's growing string of data surprises, analysts continue to maintain that factory-gate prices will lose steam eventually if regulatory tightening continues and consumer and corporate borrowing costs inexorably rise.
Saturday's data also suggested that the year-long gains in producer prices are starting to percolate through to the broader economy, but at a modest pace, which will be welcome news to the central bank.
China's retail inflation has been quite mild this year, raising questions about the accuracy of other official data that showed robust economic activity.
But consumer inflation rate quickened more than expected to 1.8 percent in August from 1.4 percent in July, the first time it has accelerated in three months.
The consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to rise 1.6 percent on-year.
Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index (CPI), fell 0.2 percent from a year earlier.
Non-food price inflation quickened to 2.3 percent in August from 2 percent in July. 
The government is targeting economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year and inflation of 3 percent, so the latest reading is still well within the central bank's comfort range.

China will release further August data next week on bank lending, industrial output, retail sales and investment, which are expected to point to solid growth.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent, matching the rise in each of the previous two months. The department last month reported that wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in July.
Auto inventories increased 0.2 percent in July after jumping 1.1 percent in June. Slowing demand for autos has left manufacturers with an inventory glut, but economists say demand is likely to increase as drivers in Texas and other states ravaged by hurricanes replace storm-damaged vehicles.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale inventories excluding autos - rose 0.7 percent in July.
Durable goods inventories rose 0.9 percent, helped by a 1.1 percent increase in stocks of machinery, the biggest rise in nearly three-and-a-half years. Inventories of electrical equipment rose 2.6 percent.
Inventory investment had a neutral impact on the second quarter's 3.0 percent annualized GDP growth rate after subtracting 1.46 percentage points from growth at the start of the year.
Sales at wholesalers slipped 0.1 percent after rising by a revised 0.6 percent in June. Economists had expected sales to rise 0.4 percent in July.
Motor vehicles sales slid 0.8 percent in July after rising 0.2 percent in June.

At July's sales pace, it would take 1.30 months to clear shelves, which was the highest since November 2016. That compared with 1.29 months in June. The inventories-to-sales ratio for motor vehicles rose to 1.80 months from 1.78 in June. That ratio has increased from 1.67 months in January.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy added more jobs than expected in August, sending the unemployment rate to its lowest since the financial crisis, but part-time hiring accounted for all of the gains.
The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2 percent from 6.3 percent, its lowest since October 2008, while the participation rate held steady, Statistics Canada said on Friday. 
Part-time jobs increased by 110,400 last month, while the economy shed 88,100 full-time positions. 
Job growth picked up by 22,200 positions overall, topping expectations for an increase of 19,000. 
Economists said the mixed report was not surprising, given the strong run of job gains over the last year. The employment report can be volatile from one month to the next.
""It's ... a slightly more moderate pace than what we've been looking at in the first half of the year, but it still represents solid hiring by Canadian firms,"" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
There were also signs that wage pressures were rising, with average hourly pay up 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the strongest annual increase since last October. Wage growth has been muted despite solid gains in the labor market.
""That's a pretty solid appreciation in the pace of wage growth,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. ""I think we are on the path to 2.5 to 3 percent wage growth off into next year.""
The mixed report led the Canadian dollar to pare gains against its U.S. counterpart. Markets trimmed expectations that the Bank of Canada could raise interest rates next month but increased bets on a December move. [CAD/]
Surprisingly strong economic growth prompted the central bank to increase rates earlier this week for the second time this year and left the door open to more hikes.
Service sector industries led employment gains in August, with an increase of 14,600 jobs in the finance, insurance and real estate category. Employers also added 9,800 positions in transportation and warehousing, and 8,900 in accommodation and food services. 
Most of the decrease in full-time employment occurred among workers between the ages of 15 and 24. In the last year, employers have added 213,000 full-time jobs, compared with 161,000 part-time positions.

Separate data showed Canada's industrial capacity rose to 85.0 percent in the second quarter, its highest level since 2007, on increased volumes of oil and gas extraction.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",UK manufacturers enjoy strongest growth this year but trade weak,"LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Britain's manufacturing output expanded at the strongest pace this year in July, but there was little sign of improvement in the trade deficit despite sterling's sharp fall since last year's Brexit vote. 
The data, released on Friday along with figures for the construction industry, suggest Britain's economy continues to expand at a modest pace at the start of the third quarter after suffering the slowest start to the year since 2012. 
The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent in July, above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll, after car production reversed a dip in the previous month.
Growth in the broader measure of industrial output slowed to 0.2 percent from 0.5 percent, in line with forecasts as a continued lack of seasonal maintenance of North Sea oil fields boosted energy production.
Business surveys over the last week suggested manufacturers look set for a stronger end to the year, boosted by exports - especially to the European Union. But muted investment intentions also pointed to nervousness about the economic outlook ahead of Brexit.
The economy is ""treading water"" ahead of Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said on Friday after it downgraded forecasts for growth over the next two years.
The BCC expects growth next year to be the weakest since the 2008-2009 recession, with gross domestic product rising by just 1.2 percent, down from an earlier 1.3 percent forecast. Growth in 2019 is predicted to be little better at 1.4 percent.
The ONS said Britain's trade deficit in goods edged up to 11.576 billion pounds from a sharply downwardly revised 11.527 billion pounds for June. 
Although slightly undershooting the Reuters poll consensus, July's deficit was the biggest since March. Britain's total trade deficit in goods and services was little changed at 2.872 billion pounds.
The ONS said goods exports to the EU increased but this was offset by falling goods exports to the rest of the world.
In volume terms, goods exports in the three months to July grew by 1.2 percent compared with the previous three months, the weakest increase since October and showing little sign of a boost from the pound's post-Brexit vote plunge.
Rising inflation and slow wage growth is expected to weigh on the economy throughout this year although the Bank of England hopes that will be eased by stronger exports helped by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.
The ONS also released figures for construction output in July, which dropped by 0.9 percent on the month - the biggest drop in three months and below all forecasts in the Reuters poll.

On the year, output was 0.4 percent lower, and a sharp fall in second quarter orders raises the prospect of further decline.

The downgrade was widely expected after data used to revise gross domestic product (GDP) figures showed capital spending growth in April-June slowed from the previous quarter.
While the disappointing data may weaken confidence in the government's economic policies and the business outlook, analysts still expect the economy to sustain a steady recovery as robust global demand underpins exports and a tightening job market improves the prospects for higher wages.
""It's indeed a big revision, but growth in the economy and capital expenditure is still pretty fast,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's no need to be pessimistic about Japan's economy. Given strong corporate profits and improving business sentiment, capital expenditure will remain firm.""
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in April-June, much less than an initial estimate of 4.0 percent growth, Cabinet Office data showed.
While it was lower than a median market forecast for a revision to 2.9 percent growth, the economy still managed to post a sixth straight quarter of expansion.
Japan's GDP data tends to experience big revisions due to the way the Cabinet Office estimates capital expenditure, consumption and inventory in the preliminary reading.
The downgrade in annualized GDP growth, which was the biggest since comparable data became available in 2010, was largely due to a sharp markdown in corporate capital spending.
The quarter-on-quarter pace of rise in capital expenditure was revised down to 0.5 percent from an initial reading of 2.4 percent, reflecting data that became available after the release of preliminary GDP.
Private consumption, which makes up 60 percent of GDP growth, rose 0.8 percent, roughly unchanged from the preliminary 0.9 percent increase, the data showed.
The data follows a recent run of indicators that suggests economic growth should continue in the current quarter thanks to solid exports and factory output.
""July data on industrial production and consumer spending point to a slowdown in the third quarter. But the bigger picture is that the economy is on track for the seventh consecutive quarter of expansion,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Wage growth and household spending, however, remain lackluster despite a tight job market, keeping the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain its massive monetary stimulus even as its U.S. and European counterparts contemplate a gradual exit from their ultra-loose monetary policies.

Britain's economy has cooled as the rise in inflation since last year's Brexit vote and tepid wage growth have squeezed consumers' real earnings. Recent surveys have shown a gradual decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
However, accountancy firm BDO said overall UK like-for-like sales values rose 2 percent in August after falling 0.6 percent in July.
It was the biggest rise since September 2015 and the strongest performance for the month of August in the last four years.
The BDO report chimed with other surveys that have shown increased shop spending, reflecting the rise in prices since the Brexit vote rather than an improvement in Britain's consumer economy.
BDO highlighted a strong performance for lifestyle goods, where sales rose 3.1 percent year-on-year due to increasing numbers of ""stay-at-home holidaymakers"" and foreign tourists.
Fashion sales increased by 1.5 percent, the strongest result since November 2016, while homeware sales were up 1.9 percent.
""As school terms begin after the summer break and the start of festive trading nears, retailers will be gearing up for their most critical trading months,"" said Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO.
""The uncertain environment and fragile consumer sentiment requires all retailers to be ever more strategic with their pricing and promotional activities.""

A survey by the British Retail Consortium on Tuesday showed retail sales values grew by an annual 1.3 percent on a like-for-like basis, but warned growth in volume terms was weaker than last year.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's monthly inflation rate jumped to 33.8 percent in August, with food price rises reaching hyper-inflationary levels above 50 percent, the opposition-controlled National Assembly said on Thursday.
The government stopped releasing the data more than a year ago amid a deep economic crisis, but the National Assembly has published its own figures since January. They are generally in line with private economists' estimates.
The latest month-on-month inflation figure was a jump from the 26 percent rise in prices reported in July.
In the first eight months of 2017, prices rose a cumulative 366.4 percent, according to the legislative body.
""Food is now in hyperinflation,"" said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado, adding that the food sector had seen price rises of 51 percent in August.
Economists usually define hyperinflation as occurring when monthly rates exceed 50 percent. 
Millions of Venezuelans are suffering from food and medicine shortages as the oil producer struggles with an economic crisis that spurred months of nationwide unrest earlier this year.
However, the protests have died down in recent weeks, with many in the opposition viewing them as fruitless after socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government sidelined the National Assembly and created its own legislative superbody.
'ECONOMIC WAR'
The country's bolivar currency also weakened past 20,000 per dollar on the widely-used black market on Thursday for the first time. It has lost 95 percent of its value against the U.S. currency in the past year.
The value of $1,000 in local currency purchased when Maduro came to power in April 2013 would now be worth $1.20.
Maduro blames the crisis on the country's opposition and the United States, whom he says are waging an ""economic war"" against his government.
Critics blame Maduro's economic policies including a currency policy that pegs the bolivar at 10 per dollar at the strongest rate and the strict price controls which they say disincentivize production.
Opponents also point to a rapidly rising money supply. The country's M2 figure is up 431 percent in the last year alone.
The exponential rise in M2 - the sum of cash, together with checking, savings, and other deposits - means an exponential rise in the amount of currency circulating.

Coupled with a decline in the output of goods and services, that has accelerated inflation.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2017 02:00PM ET</span>",Bank of Canada rate hikes done for 2017; faster pace seen in 2018: Reuters poll,"By Leah Schnurr and Anu Bararia
OTTAWA/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is likely done raising interest rates this year, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed on Thursday, though the central bank is seen charting a more aggressive tightening path for 2018 than had been anticipated.
The Bank of Canada surprised many with a rate increase on Wednesday, its second this year, and left the door open to further hikes amid strong economic growth that has made Canada a leader among its industrialized peers.
The median forecast among 10 of Canada's 11 primary dealers that deal directly with the Bank of Canada at debt auctions is for the central bank to wait until the first quarter of next year to hike again.
That will give the central bank time to see how its two back-to-back rate hikes are absorbed by the economy as well as heavily indebted consumers. 
There is a risk the bank could increase rates for a third time in 2017 if economic data continues to be strong, forecasters said, with 4 primary dealers expecting the bank will raise again in the fourth quarter. 
""It really very much depends on how the data pan out over the next six weeks or so,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Though BMO expects the central bank's next move to be in the first quarter of 2018, further strong performance from the Canadian economy would mean ""the door is wide open for October, clearly,"" said Reitzes.
Respondents put the median probability of the bank hiking at its next meeting in October at 30 percent, roughly in line with market odds of 35 percent. 
The Bank of Canada's overnight rate is now seen rising to 1.75 percent by the end of next year, 25 basis points higher than economists had expected by that time in a wider Reuters poll done last week.
How fast the Bank of Canada can raise rates in 2018 will also depend on the Federal Reserve being in tightening mode next year, economists said. 
If the U.S. central bank is not raising rates at the same time, that could drive the Canadian dollar up too far and undermine the economic outlook, said Stefane Marion, chief economist at National Bank Financial.
""The Bank of Canada is going at it alone where the Fed seems to be sidelined for the time being, which is unusual,"" Marion said.
Dovish comments from Fed policymakers earlier this week reduced the likelihood of another rate hike south of the border this year in the midst of weak inflation data.
The Bank of Canada will want to wait to see what the Fed does this year before it decides to move again, said CIBC Capital Markets senior economist Andrew Grantham, who expects the bank to pause until the second quarter of 2018.
""Our view is still that they are going to take it slow, and the reason why we expect that even though the statement was kind of on the hawkish side is that the Canadian dollar has appreciated quite a bit,"" said Grantham.
""That adds to the slowing impact that these rate hikes will have on the economy."" 
The Canadian dollar has gained almost 10 percent against the greenback this year, including a nearly 2 percent jump since Wednesday's rate hike.
For now, however, the Bank of Canada appears to be less worried about a stronger Canadian dollar than it has been in the past, Marion said. 
While the bank noted the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar in its statement on Wednesday, it said the gain in part reflected the strength of the Canadian economy.

""It seems like they're much less currency focused than they were in the past in that statement,"" said Marion, who expects a rate hike in December.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2017 12:12PM ET</span>",Hurricane Harvey boosts U.S. jobless claims to more than two-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits jumped to a more than two-year high last week amid a surge in applications in hurricane-ravaged Texas, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a strong labor market.
The surge in claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday offered an early glimpse of Hurricane Harvey's impact on the economy. The storm unleashed unprecedented flooding in Houston, disrupting oil, natural gas and petrochemical production and forcing a temporary closure of refineries.
As Texas tries to recover from the late August storm, Florida is bracing for Hurricane Irma, which is expected to make landfall over the weekend.
Economists say Harvey could put a dent in third-quarter gross domestic product and hold back job growth in September. But they expect any lost output to be recouped in the fourth quarter and payrolls growth to rebound in October.
""The near-term economic impact of what increasingly appears to be two severe natural disasters in close proximity to one another will be a clear negative,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""Having said that, the national economy appears to remain on track.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 62,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 for the week ended Sept. 2, the highest level since April 2015, the Labor Department said. The weekly increase was the largest since November 2012. A Labor Department official said last week's data had been impacted by Hurricane Harvey.
Unadjusted claims for Texas surged 51,637 last week as some people found themselves temporarily unemployed. That accounted for 95.6 percent of the increase in unadjusted claims last week.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 241,000 in the latest week. Claims could stay elevated for the next few weeks.
LABOR MARKET FIRMING
Despite last week's jump, claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market, for the 131st straight week. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased by 13,500 to 250,250 last week, still suggesting the labor market continues to strengthen.
There are concerns, however, that disruptions from the flooding in Houston could hurt job growth in September. Employment in Houston is a little over 3 million.
""If employment were to decline by just 5 percent, that would mean a job loss of 150,000,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. ""We do not rule out the possibility of a negative payroll print in September, especially given the potential for further damage from Hurricane Irma.""
The economy created 156,000 jobs in August, a slowdown in job growth that was largely blamed on a seasonal quirk. 
Economists did not expect the temporary headwinds from the storms to stop the Federal Reserve from announcing a plan later this month to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities accumulated as it sought to stimulate the economy.
The dollar fell against the euro as the European Central Bank signaled it was preparing to scale back its $2.75 trillion stimulus program. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
    In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said worker productivity increased at a 1.5 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, revised up from the 0.9 percent pace it reported last month. 
That followed a 0.1 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. Despite the upward revision to productivity, the trend remains weak, suggesting it would be difficult to achieve robust economic growth. 
President Donald Trump has vowed to boost annual growth to 3 percent through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and regulatory rollbacks. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, productivity increased at a 1.3 percent rate, instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent pace. 
With productivity rising, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at only a 0.2 percent pace in the second quarter, revised down from the previously reported 0.6 percent pace. 
""The data do nothing to suggest a change in the three key underlying trends noted in previous reports - slow productivity growth, sluggish real wage growth, and low wage inflation,"" said 

Patrick Newport, a U.S. economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts.

The seasonally adjusted index fell to 56.3 from 60.0 in July. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in the pace of activity. The unadjusted index rose to 56.8 from 52.9.
On an adjusted basis, the measure of prices tumbled to 59.9 from 69.2, suggesting companies may find their margins less squeezed by input costs.
The gauge of employment rose for the third month in a row to 55.9 from 52.6. The reading could bode well for the broader jobs report due on Friday, which has shown a strengthening labor market over the past year.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarmproductivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a1.5 percent annualized rate. Productivity was previously reported to have increased at a 0.9 percent pace in the April-June period. It grew at a 0.1 percent rate in the first quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that productivity would be revised up to a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter.
The government last week revised up second-quarter gross domestic product growth to a 3.0 percent rate from a 2.6 percent pace.
Despite the upward revision to productivity, the trend remains weak, suggesting it would be difficult to achieve robust economic growth. President Donald Trump has vowed to boost annual growth to 3 percent through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and regulatory rollbacks.
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, productivity increased at a 1.3 percent rate, instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent pace. That was the strongest performance in two years. With productivity rising, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at only a 0.2 percent pace in the second quarter. Unit labor costs were previously reported to have risen at a 0.6 percent pace. They surged at a 4.8 percent rate in the January-March period. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, unit labor costsfell at a 0.2 percent rate as previously reported.
Wage growth has remained sluggish even as the labor market nears full employment. Productivity increased at an average annual rate of 1.2percent from 2007 to 2016, below its long-term rate of 2.1percent from 1947 to 2016, indicating the economy's potential growth rate has declined. Some economists blame soft productivity on a shortage of workers as well as the impact of rampant drug addiction in some parts of the country. Others also argue that low capital expenditure, which they say has resulted in a sharp drop in the capital-to-labor ratio, is holding down productivity. There is also a belief that productivity is being inaccurately measured, especially on the information technology side. Hours worked rose at a rate of 2.5 percent in the April-June period as previously reported. That was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2015, and followed a 1.6 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. As a result, output per worker surged at a 4.0 percent rate, the fastest since the third quarter of 2014, after rising at a1.8 percent pace at the start of the year.

Output was previously reported to have increased at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter.

The ECB kept its rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, at -0.40%.
The main refinancing rate was unchanged at zero while the rate on the marginal lending facility, or emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks, stayed at 0.25%.
The ECB reiterated that it expects policy rates to remain “at present levels” for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.
The bank also reiterated that it sees its asset purchase program continuing at the current monthly pace of €60 billion ($65.4 billion) until the end of December 2017, “or beyond, if necessary”.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew at a robust pace in the three months to June, driven mostly by higher domestic demand and investment, official data released on Thursday confirmed.
The European statistics office Eurostat said the euro zone's expansion picked up speed in the second quarter, with the economy growing 0.6 percent compared with the previous three months. That was in line with previous estimates and market expectations and up from a 0.5 percent rise in January-March.
The acceleration was driven by growing consumer spending and investment, with the economy shrugging off slower export growth as a result of the strong euro.
Household consumption went up by 0.5 percent in the second quarter from 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year, and imports more than doubled their growth rate to 0.9 percent from 0.4 percent.
Government expenditure also accelerated to 0.5 percent from 0.2 percent.
Higher consumer confidence and demand drove up investment, which expanded by 0.9 percent after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous quarter.
Hit by the stronger euro, which is up around 13 percent against the dollar this year, exports slowed their growth to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent in the previous quarter.
Eurostat also revised upwards the data on euro zone growth on a yearly basis. The bloc's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2.3 percent in the second quarter and by 2.0 percent in the first three months of the year, higher than previous estimates of 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.
The yearly figure for the second quarter was also higher than the average forecast of economists polled by Reuters who had expected a 2.2 percent rise on the year.
The Eurostat reading came as European Central Bank policymakers met in Frankfurt. Their interest rate decisions are to be announced at 1145 GMT, followed by ECB President Mario Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT.

The GDP growth and its domestic component confirm the healthy state of the bloc's economy, positive news for the ECB which could start preparing the ground for a reduction of its monetary stimulus, even though inflation remains below target.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2017 06:45AM ET</span>",Record cereals prospects push down global food prices,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices fell in August from the month before as the prospect of bumper harvests pushed down cereal values, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
Despite the drop, food on international markets remained 6 percent more expensive than a year earlier. Food commodities have emerged from an era of intense volatility and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expects them to remain stable over the next decade. 
The FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 176.6 points in August, down 1.3 percent from July.
The cereals sub-index fell 5.4 percent due to expectations of higher production, especially in the Black Sea region. Meat and sugar prices also declined due to high supply forecasts.
Global cereals output is expected to hit an all-time high of 2.611 billion tonnes in the 2017-18 season, up 18.4 million tonnes on the previous month's forecast, the FAO said, and worldwide stocks are also set to hit a new record.
Food prices rose steadily in the three months preceding August, but ample supply looks unlikely to leave room for price increases in the near future, FAO chief economist Abdolreza Abbassian said.
""Overall supply for nearly all the commodities we cover points to levels which go beyond projected demand, at least for now,"" he said. ""The potential dynamic in the future seems to be rather bearish in most aspects."" 
If forecasts come to fruition, the cereals harvest will be slightly higher than a record hit last year. The FAO also raised its estimate for global wheat output to 748.8 million tonnes, up 1.2 percent from the prior month's forecast. 

Hurricanes in the United States have not affected the crops covered by the index, Abbassian said, as harvests had been carried out before they struck, although there would be a localized impact on infrastructure.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2017 06:26PM ET</span>","Brazil cuts rates to 8.25 percent, signals gradual end to easing","By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank slashed interest rates to a four-year low on Wednesday to spur an incipient economic recovery, but said the pace of monetary easing would probably be reduced next month as policymakers prepared to gradually stop cutting rates.
The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, cut its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> by 100 basis points for a fourth straight time, to 8.25 percent. The decision was widely expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
With inflation holding near 18-year lows and far below the bottom of the central bank's target range, policymakers have slashed borrowing costs since last October in hopes of pulling the economy out of its worst recession on record.
Interest rates, approaching a record low of 7.25 percent, are below neutral levels, the committee said.
That means they are already expected to sustain a gradual economic recovery, leaving the bank comfortable to make a first reference to a ""gradual ending to the cycle"" in the statement accompanying the decision.
""Provided the committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time Copom views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate,"" the committee said.
The bank revised up its inflation forecast for 2018 to 4.4 percent, from 4.3 percent at its previous meeting. The government's target is 4.5 percent. In August, the official rate fell to an 18-year low of 2.46 percent.
Brazil has resumed growth in the first half of the year, but high unemployment and low usage of production capacity by most companies after the recession continue to keep prices under control. Bumper food crops have also curbed food inflation.
""The understanding of the market is that the bank is signaling a cut of 75 bps in the next meeting, followed by a 50 bps cut and then one of 25 bps that could be the last,"" said Marco Caruso, an economist with Banco Pine in Sao Paulo.

""The bank seems to be comfortable signaling a reduction to at least 7 percent, with a possibility of going below 7 by the end of the cycle,"" Caruso added.

(Reuters) - Orders of the heavy-duty trucks that move America's freight rose 50 percent in August compared to the same period a year ago, fueled by strong freight volumes, according to preliminary figures released on Wednesday by a firm that tracks the sector.
According to FTR Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), orders of Class 8 trucks, at 20,700 units, jumped 14 percent in August above July levels and 50 percent higher than the same period in 2016.
August marks the third consecutive month of rising truck orders after U.S. heavy-duty truck orders surged 79 percent in July and rose 38 percent in June following a surprising drop in May. [L1N1KP0VT][L1N1JW1U4]
""Freight continues to show some impressive growth,"" said Don Ake, Vice President of Commercial Vehicles at FTR. ""This has created capacity tightness in some regions which is expected to spread to more areas as economic growth expands.""
Ake also said it appears May's 16,500 orders will be the low point for the year and orders are expected to climb in September leading into the fourth quarter.
Commercial truck makers endured weak sales and high retail inventories during 2016. This year, analysts predict higher orders for trucks and an even better 2018.
The growth in 2018 could be fueled by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs in December 2017. Experts predict many smaller truck firms that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop.
That is expected to boost truck orders by larger fleet owners next year.
""The capacity crunch will be exacerbated by the ELD mandate, spurring demand for trucks and trailers in 2018,"" Ake said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity accelerated in August amid strong gains in new orders and employment, suggesting that a slowdown in job growth last month was probably temporary.
The economic outlook received a further boost from other data on Wednesday showing only a modest rise in the trade deficit in July. The reports were the latest signs that the economy had gathered momentum early in the third quarter. 
Economists, however, cautioned that Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, could sap some of the strength.
""The U.S. economy carried a little more momentum than originally thought,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist atBMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""However, some of that momentum will be blunted by, for starters, Hurricane Harvey.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased 1.4 points to 55.3 in August, rebounding from an 11-month low in the prior month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Last month's increase in services industry activity also reflected a jump of 1.6 points in the production subindex. 
Even more encouraging, a measure of services sector employment jumped 2.6 points. The government reported last week that the economy created 156,000 jobs in August, with the private services sector hiring the smallest number of workers in five months. 
Economists largely shrugged off the slowdown in job growth, blaming it on a seasonal quirk. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength.
Last month, services industries also reported an increase in new orders as well as prices. The ISM said the ""majority of respondents are optimistic about business conditions going forward.""
The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies (DXY) as traders digested news that Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer would step down next month.
Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose, while stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher.
CHINA TRADE GAP WIDENS
Reports on consumer and business spending have suggested the economy gathered more strength early in the third quarter after gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the April-June period. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit rose 0.3 percent to $43.7 billion in July. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit widened to $61.6 billion from $60.8 billion in June. 
The so-called real goods deficit in July was below the second-quarter average of $62.4 billion. 
While that suggests trade could add to gross domestic product in the third quarter, economists at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) cautioned that Hurricane Harvey could significantly impact commodity prices and trade volumes, and push up the trade deficit in September. 
Trade added two-tenths of a percentage point to GDP in the second quarter. 
The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased to an 11-month high in July. That ongoing deficit has grabbed the attention of President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for helping to decimate U.S. factory jobs as well as stunting U.S. economic growth.
Trump, who argues that the United States has been disadvantaged in its dealings with trade partners, has ordered the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed in 1994 by the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
On Saturday, Trump threatened to withdraw from a free trade deal with South Korea.
""When you negotiate with countries keep in mind you are really going up against some of the biggest corporations in America who moved their operations overseas years ago,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""This deficit concern is somewhat misguided as it is largely a trade war with ourselves. These jobs are not coming back to America's heartland."" 
In July, real goods exports slipped despite petroleum exports hitting a record high. Exports of goods and services fell 0.3 percent to $194.4 billion in July. Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell, but shipments of capital goods rose.
Exports to China increased 3.5 percent, while those to the European Union tumbled 9.8 percent. 
Imports of goods and services slipped 0.2 percent to $238.1 billion in July. There were declines in imports of motor vehicles and parts as well as crude oil. 
Imports of goods from China increased 3.1 percent. The U.S.-China trade deficit rose 3.0 percent to $33.6 billion in July, the highest level since August 2016. 

The United States saw a 3.7 percent drop in goods and services imported from the EU in July, which left the trade deficit with the economic bloc 7.9 percent higher at an eight-month high of $13.5 billion.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2017 11:55AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada surprises with second rate hike, eyes future moves","By Andrea Hopkins and Leah Schnurr
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada raised interest rates on Wednesday, surprising many, and left the door open to more rate hikes in 2017 even as it pledged to pay attention to how higher borrowing costs would hit Canada's indebted households.
The 25-basis-point increase to 1 percent followed a hike in July and puts Canada ahead of the curve in returning borrowing costs to more normal levels after they were slashed due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. While the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun tightening, its pace has been slower.
The Bank of Canada said the hike was warranted given unexpectedly strong economic growth in the second quarter, but said future moves are not predetermined and would be guided by data and market developments.
""I guess they felt the economy was too strong for their comfort and raises inflation risks,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
While a significant minority in the market had bet on a move on Wednesday, most analysts had expected the bank would wait until its October meeting to hike, and the back-to-back increases rocked financial markets.
The Canadian dollar surged more than 2 percent after the announcement to its strongest since June 2015 at C$1.2140, while the 2-year yield jumped as much as 10 basis points to its highest since April 2012 at 1.450 percent.
The tone of the statement that accompanied the rate decision had not moderated at all since July, when the bank raised rates for the first time in nearly seven years, said Eric Theoret, currency strategist at Scotiabank.
""There is no sense that the Bank of Canada looks to be moderating the tighter path from here. For them, it's still a very data-dependent outlook,"" Theoret said.
The market had widely expected the Bank to reverse the two rate cuts it made in 2015 amid a decline in oil prices that sideswiped Canada's energy-dependent economy. 
Now that the so-called insurance has been removed, the next step is less certain, particularly given the vulnerability of Canada's indebted consumers and housing market to higher interest rates.
Canadian household debt is near record levels and housing prices in Toronto, Canada's biggest city, have already fallen more than 20 percent from their April peak. 
While some analysts fear higher rates will hurt consumers and spur a broader housing market correction, Dominion Lending Centers Chief Economist Sherry Cooper said the bank's policymakers are likely happy with the slowdown.
""This is a change welcomed by the Bank and government authorities concerned about the continued rise in household debt,"" Cooper said in a note to clients.
Guatieri said if the economy remains exceptionally strong, the bank could hike again in October, but the sensitivity of indebted households and the housing market to higher interest rates ""probably warrants some caution on their part."" 

Markets will now be watching both economic data and a speech by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz scheduled for Sept. 27 in which he is expected to provide an economic update.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2017 11:11AM ET</span>",U.S. home refinancing activity hits 11-week high: MBA,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications to refinance a home increased to their highest level in 11 weeks as home borrowing costs declined to their lowest levels since November, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Requests for home loans in Texas were reduced by more than a fifth from the previous week in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the most powerful storm to slam that state in over 50 years. However, the drop did not have a meaningful impact on overall application volume.
Mortgage rates have fallen since mid-July in step with bond yields as hopes faded for tax reform, infrastructure spending and other fiscal stimulus from Washington in 2017. Tensions between North Korea and the United States and its allies over the former's nuclear weapon program has compounded the decline in bond yields.
“Heightened geopolitical tensions last week brought mortgage rates to their lowest level since the 2016 (U.S. presidential) election,"" Joel Kan, an economist with the Washington-based industry group said in a statement.
Last week, the average interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.06 percent, a nine-month low, from 4.11 percent the prior week, the MBA said.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were anywhere from 2 basis points to 12 basis points lower.
Lower borrowing costs revived home owners' interest in refinancing their existing loans. 
MBA's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage refinancing activity rose 5.1 percent to 1,502.6 in the week ended Sept. 1. This was the strongest since 1,526.8 in the week of June 16.
The share of refinancing requests versus total applications grew to 50.9 percent, the biggest since January 2017, from 49.4 percent a week ago.
The MBA's barometer on total mortgage applications adjusted for seasonal factors rose 3.3 percent to 420.5 last week.
Lower borrowing costs stemmed a further decline in loan demand to buy a home.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase mortgage activity, a proxy on future home sales, edged up 1.4 percent to 227.3 after hitting a six-month low the prior week. Purchase loan applications, not accounting for seasonal factors, slipped over 1 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, purchase mortgage and refinancing activity in Texas declined by 21.7 percent and 22.9 percent last week, according to Kan.

The BoC raised the cash rate to 1.0% from 0.75% previously. It also raised the bank rate to 1.25% and the deposit rate to 0.75%.
In a statement, the bank said consumer spending remains robust, underpinned by continued solid employment and income growth.
""Given the stronger-than-expected economic performance, Governing Council judges that today’s removal of some of the considerable monetary policy stimulus in place is warranted.""
The bank said it continued to expect a moderation in the pace of economic growth in the second half of the year, but said the level of GDP is now higher than it had expected.
The BoC hiked rates for the first time in seven years at its previous meeting in July and indicated that it could do so again in the coming months.
The odds of a hike as early as this week jumped to 41% after data late last week showed Canada's economy grew 4.5% in the second quarter, the fastest rate in almost six years.
Prior to the July move the bank had kept rates unchanged since two rate cuts in 2015 and the prolonged period of low borrowing costs has been blamed for helping inflate the housing market, particularly in Toronto, Canada's largest city."

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) increased to 55.3 in August from the prior month’s reading of 53.9.
Analysts had expected the index to rise a bit higher to 55.4 last month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index increased to 57.5 last month, 1.6 points above July’s reading of 55.9 and better than the consensus forecast of 56.0.
The New Orders Index registered 57.1 in August, 2.0 points higher than the reading of 55.1 in the previous month.
The Employment Index rose 2.6 points to 56.2 last month from July’s reading of 53.6.
The Prices Index increased 2.2 points to 57.9 in August from the prior month’s reading of 55.7.
The ISM indicated that it was the 92nd consecutive month of expansion of economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector.
“The non-manufacturing sector has rebounded from the prior month’s cooling-off period”, ISM chair Anthony Nieves declared in the report.
“The majority of respondents are optimistic about business conditions going forward,” he added.
Following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.1922 compared to 1.1921 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.3055 from 1.3048 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 109.04 from 109.03 prior to the publication.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian inflation hit a fresh 18-year low in August due to an abundant harvest, undershooting all estimates and giving plenty of room for the central bank to keep cutting interest rates.
The IPCA consumer price index rose 2.46 percent in the 12 months through August, statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday. The annual inflation rate came in below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters survey of 23 economists.
The reading suggests that recent improvement in the labor market and consumer spending have yet to generate substantial price pressures, a welcome development as Latin America's largest economy emerges from its deepest recession in a century.
Inflation slowed in sectors closely tied to the pace of economic activity, such as healthcare, education and discretionary consumer spending.
Consumer prices rose 0.19 percent from July, slowing from the 0.24 percent rate seen in the previous month.
Economists had expected the monthly inflation rate to accelerate to 0.31 percent, due to a mid-July tax hike on fuel prices as well as higher electricity rates. The surprising data may indicate that the impact of those one-off items is fading.
The 12-month inflation rate has fallen well below the bottom end of the central bank's target range of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage point for months, allowing the central bank to cut interest rates to the lowest levels since 2013.
Policymakers are widely expected to lower the benchmark Selic rate by a further 100 basis points later on Wednesday, extending the deepest easing cycle in a decade.

Yields paid on Brazilian interest rate futures <0#2DIJ:> fell in early Wednesday trading as traders bet that the central bank will hint it may maintain an aggressive pace of cuts in its October meeting.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit in July shrank to C$3.04 billion, thanks largely to a strong Canadian dollar that cut the value of imports and also helped depress exports, Statistic Canada said on Wednesday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a shortfall of C$3.1 billion. Statscan revised June's deficit to C$3.76 billion in June from an initial C$3.60 billion.
In volume terms, imports fell by 2.3 percent while exports dropped by 1.1 percent.
The data came too late to influence the Bank of Canada, which was due to make an interest rate announcement at 10 am ET (1400 GMT) on Wednesday. Analysts are split over whether it will hike rates for the second time this year as the economy strengthens.
The central bank has long fretted over what it sees as the relative underperformance of Canada's non-energy export sector.
""Prices did play a significant role but weaker volumes also contributed and point to a slowdown in growth in the third quarter,"" said Royce Mendes of CIBC Economics.
The value of imports fell by 6.0 percent from June, with lower prices accounting for most of the decline. The Canadian dollar gained 3.6 U.S. cents against the greenback in July.
The robust domestic currency also depressed the value of exports, which dropped by 4.9 percent after falling by 5.0 percent in June. Many major exporters price their goods in U.S. dollars, which means they receive fewer Canadian dollars as the currency strengthens.
Export Development Canada Chief Economist Peter Hall said the slipping exports could be explained in part by longer than usual shutdowns in the auto sector.
""Two months of declining exports bears watching ... This is not great news but the fundamentals suggest this is not going to last,"" he said in a phone interview.
Exports to the United States, which accounted for 75.5 percent of Canadian goods exports in July, fell by 3.2 percent while imports plunged by 6.7 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States grew to C$2.90 billion from C$1.80 billion in June.
Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said although the trade balance had improved, ""unfortunately it is not coming from the source you want to see, strength in exports"".

Separately, Statscan said the labor productivity of businesses dipped by 0.1 percent in the second quarter as the number of hours worked grew faster than business output.

Sales fell 34.8 percent month from August 2016, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said in a report. It was the fifth straight month of declining sales after a years-long boom that sparked fears of a bubble.
While prices were up 3.0 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the group's home price index, they were down 1.8 percent from July as both sales and new listings fell, TREB said. 
The average selling price for all home types combined was C$732,292 ($591,273), down 20.3 percent from a peak C$919,086 in April. 
The Ontario government introduced multiple measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, in a bid to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding areas.
While most data has shown foreign buyers represent only a small portion of buyers in Toronto, TREB said the government move sparked a shift in sentiment.
""If current conditions are sustained over the coming months, we would expect to see year-over-year price growth normalize slightly above the rate of inflation,"" the board's director of market analysis, Jason Mercer, said in a statement.
New listings fell 6.7 percent from a year earlier, while active listings were up 65 percent as properties sit on the market for longer. 
The dramatic shift in the Toronto market comes as the Bank of Canada has begun what most analysts believe will be a gradual process of raising interest rates from near historic lows.
The central bank raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent in July and markets expect at least one more hike before the end of the year, possibly later on Wednesday. 

Some experts have said low rates have encouraged consumers to take on too much debt and fueled the housing boom.

The world's third-largest economy is seen expanding at an annualized pace of 2.9 percent in April-June, the poll of 17 analysts found, which would be a significant downward revision from the 4.0 percent growth seen in the preliminary data.
That would translate into 0.7 percent growth from the previous quarter, revised down from an initial reading of 1.0 percent, the poll showed.
""Capital spending is likely be revised down. But overall, the economy maintained its high rate of growth helped by consumer spending and public investment,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
He expects the economy will continue its recovery in July-September and after.
""Both domestic and external demand will likely perform well thanks to the global economic recovery. But we need to watch downside risks from China's economy and a possible downturn in consumer spending due to bad weather."" 
Capital expenditure, a major component of gross domestic product, is expected to have risen 0.5 percent over the quarter, much slower than the 2.4 percent rise shown in the preliminary data.
Japanese companies curbed their pace of investment in plant and equipment in April-June, suggesting the government may revise down its initially rosy estimate for economic growth in the second quarter.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy rebounded last quarter as consumers and government spent freely after a weather-beaten start to the year, while a long downturn in mining investment finally loosened its deadening grip on growth.
Wednesday's GDP report showed the economy expanded 0.8 percent in the second quarter, up from 0.3 percent in the first quarter and outpacing even the much-vaunted U.S. recovery.
Yet all this growth has shown no sign of rekindling inflation and, with plenty of spare capacity in the labor market, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) seems content to leave interest rates at record lows for months to come.
""We have an economy that is enjoying its longest-ever expansion,"" said Craig James, chief economist at stockbroker CommSec. ""Inflation is below 2 percent; unemployment is below longer-term averages; consumers and businesses are spending.""
""It's an economy that doesn't need to be slowed down or sped up by policy changes like movements in interest rates.""
That was very much the view laid out by RBA Governor Philip Lowe in a speech late Tuesday.
""It will be some time before we are at what could be considered full employment and before underlying inflation is at the mid-point of the medium-term target range,"" he declared.
""This means that stimulatory monetary policy continues to be appropriate.""
Interbank futures <0#YIB:> imply virtually no prospect of a move in the 1.5 percent cash rate this year and around a 50-50 chance of a hike by June 2018.
The goldilocks data won a round of applause in the bond market where yields on government debt fell (AU10YT=RR). The local dollar dipped to $0.7993 <AUD=D4> as speculators had been wagering on an even stronger growth outcome.
INFRASTRUCTURE BOOM
Over the year to June, gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to A$1.75 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$72,180 for each of Australia's 24.5 million citizens.
The economy expanded by 1.8 percent compared to a year ago, held back by a rare contraction in the third quarter of 2016. Australia has not suffered an outright recession - typically defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - since 1991.
Once that negative GDP number drops out of the calculation this quarter, annual growth could well approach 3 percent.
Driving the latest pick up was a surge in public investment, including roads, rail and a major new hospital - the country's single most expensive building.
As a result, government spending alone added 0.8 percentage points to growth. Just behind was household consumption with a contribution of 0.4 percentage points.
Consumers splashed out on food, alcohol, clothes, household goods and communications while using less gas and electricity because of rising utility prices.
Rising export volumes, particularly for liquefied natural gas, also added to growth, helping offset a rundown in inventories which was the single biggest drag in the quarter.
There was scant sign of inflationary pressures in the report with the main price measure for households up just 1.3 percent in the year to June, while inflation across the entire domestic economy rose 1.5 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese workers' wages fell in July from a year earlier on a drop in summer bonus payments, casting some doubt on the sustainability of a recent improvement in consumer spending.
Wages fell in both nominal and inflation-adjusted real terms, labor ministry data showed on Wednesday.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings fell an annual 0.3 percent, reversing from the prior month's revised 0.4 percent gain and the first decline since May 2016.
Reflecting a 0.6 percent rise in consumer prices, inflation-adjusted real wages fell 0.8 percent, down for the second straight month and the biggest decline since June 2015.
The data is likely to raise questions over the central bank's assertions that a tightening labor market will eventually lead to higher wages and a resulting increase in consumer spending, which will boost economic activity and inflation.
Some economists say the decline in real wages may weigh on private consumption, which led Japan's economy to expand at the fastest pace in more than two years in the April-June quarter.
""A sharp drop in real wages is a source of concern, which could deprive households of purchasing power, hurting private consumption as increases in electricity and gas charges push up overall prices in the July-September quarter,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""Even though the pace of declines in real wages will slow from October, nominal wages are unlikely to accelerate until next year's spring labor negotiations."" 
A ministry official said a broader, improving trend was still intact. 
""Excluding the decline in special payments, wages remain in moderate increase,"" a ministry official in charge of compiling the data told Reuters.
The ministry will issue later this year the average figures for the summer bonuses that were paid in June, July and August, the official added. 
Special payments - predominantly but not entirely made up of summer bonuses - fell 2.2 percent in July from a year ago and the first drop since January.
Some manufacturers such as automakers reduced the size of bonus payments as the yen's gains until late last year weighed on profits.
Regular pay, which determines base wages, was up 0.5 percent in the year to July, rising for a fourth straight month.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose 0.1 percent year-on-year in July, after a revised 0.1 percent drop in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest drop in nearly three years in July, but demand for capital goods was stronger than previously reported, pointing to a faster pace of business spending early in the third quarter.
Strong business spending is underpinning manufacturing and helping offset the drag from declining motor vehicle output. Manufacturing makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
Factory goods orders tumbled 3.3 percent amid a slump in demand for transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That was the biggest drop since August 2014 and followed a 3.2 percent surge in June.
Orders excluding transportation equipment rose 0.5 percent after edging up 0.1 percent the prior month. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a measure of business spending plans, jumped 1.0 percent in July instead of gaining 0.4 percent as reported last month.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods slipped 0.1 percent in June. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, jumped 1.2 percent in July instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent rise.
The surge in shipments suggests that business spending on equipment strengthened further early in the third quarter.
""The recovery in business equipment investment that began late last year appears to have continued into the second half of 2017,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Business investment on equipment increased at an 8.8 percent annualized rate in the April-June quarter, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2015. Business spending is firming even as the boost from oil and gas drilling is starting to fade as ample supplies restrain crude oil prices. 
In July, orders for computers and electronic products increased 2.1 percent, the biggest gain in a year. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components vaulted 2.6 percent, also the largest increase in a year.
MACHINERY DEMAND WEAKENING
Machinery orders, however, fell 0.9 percent. That was the largest drop in nine months and followed a 0.5 percent gain in June. Orders for industrial machinery fell 0.8 percent.
Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders rose 1.7 percent after climbing 2.5 percent in June. Demand is slowing as oil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel, and oil rigs in operation are hovering near a two-month low.
Orders for transportation equipment sagged 19.2 percent, the biggest drop since August 2014. That reflected a 70.8 percent dive in civilian aircraft orders. Boeing (N:BA) has reported on its website that it received only 22 aircraft orders in July, sharply down from 184 in the prior month.
Motor vehicle orders fell 0.9 percent after being unchanged in June. Auto sales peaked last December, leading to a slump in motor vehicle production as manufacturers work to reduce an inventory overhang. 
Production could get a boost from an anticipated spike in demand for automobiles as residents in storm-ravaged Texas replace flood-damaged vehicles. 
In July, unfilled orders at factories fell 0.3 percent after increasing 1.3 percent in June. Manufacturing inventories gained 0.2 percent, rising for the second straight month.
Shipments rose 0.3 percent. As a result, the inventories-to-shipments ratio fell to 1.37 from 1.38 in June.

""This is consistent with our expectation for inventories to be additive to growth in the second half,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The fact that the inventory-to-shipment ratio came down suggests the stockpiling is justified.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is falling further behind a fast-recovering euro zone as firms worry about Brexit and consumers feel the pinch of rising inflation and the weak pound, surveys showed on Tuesday.
Manufacturers are benefiting from increasing demand in Europe and beyond, but the much bigger UK services sector grew at its weakest pace in nearly a year in August, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index.
The world's fifth-biggest economy initially withstood the shock of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, which will remodel its ties with its biggest trade partners.
But growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose on the falling value of the pound and hit households. The economy now looks on track to grow by 0.3 percent quarter on quarter in the July-September period, IHS Markit said.
That is the same slow rate as in the previous three months, and momentum is gradually being lost, IHS Markit said.
Based on similar surveys also published on Tuesday, growth in the euro zone is likely to be at 0.6 percent, the same as in the second quarter..
The weak outlook for growth in Britain means the Bank of England, whose policymakers meet next week, is likely to keep interest rates at a record low despite rising inflation.
Separate figures published on Tuesday showed car sales fell for a fifth month in a row. Shoppers spent more on the high street and in supermarkets, but retailers said that was caused in part by the increased cost of food.
Some economists saw Tuesday's data as a precursor of more gloom.
""Where would growth come from at this stage in Britain? There is erosion of real income because of the inflation numbers and the uncertainty means investment will not play a role until you get some clarity on what is going on (about Brexit),"" said Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit.
But others predicted a slight pick-up because official data have looked a bit stronger than PMI surveys.
""We continue to think that growth will come in a bit stronger in the second half of this year,"" Paul Hollingsworth, at Capital Economics, said. ""Nonetheless, we still think that the Monetary Policy Committee will hold off until around the middle of next year, before raising interest rates.""
Sterling fell after the PMI was published but more than recovered its losses later on Tuesday. [GBP/]
JOB GROWTH STRONG, NEW ORDERS WEAK
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.2 in August from 53.8 in July, a bigger drop than the median forecast of 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was the lowest reading since September last year, shortly after the referendum vote.
Optimism among company managers edged up, but with Brexit a major concern, morale remained close to low levels that have previously indicated the economy was stalling or even contracting, IHS Markit said.
Less than two years before Britain leaves the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May's government has yet to start substantive talks with Brussels on issues such as trade.
In one bright spot, Tuesday's survey showed job creation was its strongest in 19 months as firms sought to work off backlogs.
But new orders grew at the second slowest pace since September of last year.In another concern for the BoE, prices paid by services firms grew at the fastest pace in six months, potentially adding to Britain's inflation rate which is already heading for about 3 percent, above the central bank's 2 percent target.
""Some firms also suggested that recent exchange rate depreciation against the euro would likely drive up costs in the near term,"" IHS Markit said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity in the euro zone stayed robust in August as it outpaced Britain, where an economy increasingly bogged down by Brexit worries lost momentum, surveys showed on Tuesday.
Growth in the euro zone slowed only marginally from the blistering pace set in the spring, according to a Purchasing Managers' Index. An equivalent reading for Britain was the lowest since last September, shortly after the referendum vote to leave the European Union.
""The story in the next couple of years is that by all probability - unless we get an external shock - the euro zone recovery is for real. I don't see any reason why this will peter out anytime soon,"" said Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit.
""Where would growth come from at this stage in Britain? There is erosion of real income because of the inflation numbers and the uncertainty means investment will not play a role until you get some clarity on what is going on (about Brexit).""
IHS Markit's Final Composite PMI for the euro zone held steady at 55.7 in August, slightly below an earlier flash estimate of 55.8. It has been above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction since mid-2013.
The services PMI fell to a seven-month low of 54.7 from July's 55.4 but was still one of the best growth rates in over six years. Similarly, while the new business index fell, it remained above its long-run trend.

The data suggested that euro zone and Britain's economic growth paths are diverging. 
The euro zone reading points to third quarter GDP expansion of 0.6 percent, IHS Markit said, matching second quarter growth and faster than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month.[ECILT/EU]
Britain, which initially withstood the shock of the June 2016 Brexit vote before slowing sharply in early 2017, has outpaced the bloc's economies over two-thirds of the time since recovery from the financial crisis began.
But rising inflation and weak wage growth has curtailed household spending and it is expected to grow just half the euro zone's rate this quarter, 0.3 percent, then maintain that lackluster pace through to the middle of next year. [ECILT/GB]
British shoppers increased spending in August at the fastest pace so far in 2017, excluding a surge in April caused by the Easter holiday, but there is little sign yet that a squeeze on spending is easing, retailers said on Tuesday.
Non-food sales remain at levels seen two years ago and separately on Tuesday, credit card firm Barclaycard said British consumers increased their spending at a slower pace in August and fewer of them felt confident about their finances.
PARTING WAYS
Forward-looking indicators in the euro zone survey imply there will be little slowdown this month with new orders, backlogs of work, employment and an expectation gauge remaining strong.
Yet while optimism among British company managers edged up, it remained close to low levels that have been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting in the past, with Brexit the main concern, IHS Markit said.
""Higher costs and lower investment are slowing UK output to a chronic crawl. The summer months may have been warm but the recessional risks for the UK economy are only increasing as we move into autumn,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, a foreign exchange payments company.
One common theme was rising price pressures - welcome news to policymakers at the European Central Bank who want inflation higher but less attractive to their counterparts at the Bank of England who want to bring inflation down.
The euro zone output prices index rose to 52.1 from 51.7. August inflation nudged closer to the ECB's target, registering 1.5 percent, data showed last week.
ECB policymakers meet on Thursday, and while no change is expected then, they are expected to announce a reduction of monthly asset purchases in October, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll. [ECB/INT]
BoE rate-setters meet next week. Prices paid by services firms rose at the fastest pace in six months, potentially adding to Britain's inflation rate, which is already heading for about 3 percent, above the central bank's 2 percent target. 

Most economists polled by Reuters were convinced the BoE will not raise interest rates between now and when the initial Brexit negotiation period ends in a little under two years. Only 14 of 59 economists expected one or more rate rises by end-2018.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's tourism revenues jumped by 170 percent in the first seven months of 2017, reaching $3.5 billion, a government official told Reuters, in welcome news for an economy heavily reliant on the sector for foreign currency and jobs.
The number of tourists visiting Egypt rose by 54 percent in the same seven-month period on an annual basis to reach 4.3 million, he said, attributing the increase to visitors from Germany and Ukraine.
That number is still well below the 14.7 million who visited Egypt in 2010, ahead of the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak and ushered in a prolonged period of political and social upheaval.
Europeans made up 75 percent of visitors while Arabs made up 20 percent, said the official, who asked not to be named.
Egypt hopes the number of tourists will reach 8 million in the whole of 2017, up from 4.5 million last year, he added.
Tourist revenues should hit $6 billion in 2017, up from $3.4 billion in 2016, the official said, despite a continued flight ban from Russia, traditionally a major source of tourists, after a Russian plane crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in 2015, killing all 224 people on board.
A group affiliated with Islamic State claimed responsibility for the downing of the plane, though officials have not confirmed this.
Russians accounted for a large proportion of tourists to Egypt, especially to the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
Egypt hopes that its investments in airport security and the cheaper Egyptian pound will help lure back more tourists, despite a series of militant attacks, including the fatal stabbing of two German holidaymakers at a seaside resort in July.

1675,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2017 04:32AM ET</span>",UK services activity hits 11-month low in August,"Investing.com – Activity in the UK service sector dropped more than expected in August, hitting an 11-month low and dampening optimism over the British economy as the sector makes up approximately 80% of gross domestic product, industry data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, market research group IHS Markit said the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) decreased to 53.2 last month from a reading of 53.8 in July. That was its lowest reading since September 2016.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to just 53.5.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The research group indicated highlighted in the report that input cost pressures had picked up in August.
However, despite the weak activity levels, job creation in the service sector strengthened to a 19-month high.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson pointed out that the combination of the three surveys –services, manufacturing and construction- pointed to the weakest overall expansion in six month.
“Although the latest two months’ data put the economy on course for another 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, momentum is being gradually lost,” he warned.
“Robust manufacturing growth means the economy may be rebalancing towards goods production, aided by the weaker pound, but the slowdowns in services and construction send warning signals about the health of the economy,” Williamson explained.
This expert attributed the subdued overall level of optimism to Brexit uncertainty and warned that it was close to levels that have previously indicated that the economy was close to stalling or even contracting.
“While a rise in price pressures will add to worries that inflation could pick up to perhaps 3% again in coming months, the overall level of the PMI remains more consistent with policymakers erring towards stimulus rather than hiking interest rates, suggesting the doves will continue to outnumber the hawks,” Williamson concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2925 from around 1.2922 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.9192 from 0.9191 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 141.50 compared to 141.52 previously.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded higher, with London’s FTSE 100 gaining 0.32%. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose 0.54%, France's CAC 40 traded up 0.40%, while Germany's DAX advanced 0.90%.

Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 55.8 from its ten-month low of 54.7 in July.
The reading was well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction and came in slightly better than a preliminary estimate of 55.7 which was published last month.
The main support came from manufacturing where growth accelerated at the fastest pace since April, propelled by a sharp rise in output, new orders and export business.
In the services sector, business activity increased to reach a two-month high of 53.5 in August, with orders coming in at a faster pace. Service providers continued to hire new staff, though job creation slowed to reach its slowest pace in more than a year.
In a sign that the upswing is pushing up inflation, cost pressures faced by German service providers increased. 
The rate of input price inflation picked up to reach a five-month high while prices charged by service providers accelerated at the fastest pace since March.
IHS Markit economist Trevor Balchin said that the survey data underlined the German economy's continued strength. 
IHS Markit had therefore raised its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 2.3 percent and 2.1 percent respectively.

The government predicts calendar-adjusted growth of 1.9 percent for 2017. That would be on a par with last year's performance, which was the strongest among the G7 group of the world's most industrialized countries.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.6 from 52.0 in July.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 11th consecutive month but was at the lowest level since February.
The new business index also showed expansion at a reduced pace, slipping to 52.4 in August from 52.7 in July. 
In another sign of caution, the index for business sentiment fell to 52.4 in August from 54.3 in the previous month to reach the lowest level in more than a year.
""Although growth of the service sector eased during August, wider expansion of the Japanese economy remains entrenched in a fairly decent growth range heading toward the final month of the third quarter,"" said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""However, a slide in service sector confidence to a 13-month low provides a little concern that growth could continue to falter in the near-term.""
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 51.9 in August from 51.8.
The PMI survey comes after data last week suggesting a downward revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter due to soft capital expenditure.

Many economists expect that consumer spending, business investment and exports will continue to support Japan's economy, but the growing threat of North Korea's nuclear program could easily dent sentiment and curb growth.

Retail sales grew by an annual 1.3 percent on alike-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the British Retail Consortium said.
Growth in total sales in August was also the highest non-Easter reading of the year, rising by 2.4 percent, speeding up from an increase of 1.4 percent in July.
""August provided a welcome pick-up in retail sales across channels, with non-food returning to growth as shoppers' attentions turned to homewares, autumn clothing ranges and the new school term,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.
""However, these figures tell a less positive story about the health of consumer spending than it might seem at first glance,"" she said in a statement. 
Non-food sales remain at levels seen two years ago and strong food sales largely reflect rising prices, with growth in volume terms weaker than last year, the BRC said.
A sharp fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote in June 2016, combined with weak increases in pay, has eaten into the spending power of households in Britain who are the main drivers of the country's economy.
Dickinson said a rise in employee pension contributions in April next year would further squeeze disposable incomes. 
Separately on Tuesday, credit card firm Barclaycard said British consumers increased their spending at a slower pace in August and fewer of them felt confident about their finances.
Consumer spending grew by 2.9 percent compared with August last year, down from a rise of 3.5 percent in July, Barclaycard said. The growth in spending last month was also weaker than the average increase of 3.8 percent so far in 2017.

The IPCA consumer price index probably rose 2.60 percent in the 12 months through August, according to the median of 23 forecasts in the poll, compared with an increase of 2.71 percent in the 12 months through July. 
The reading, well below the bottom of the central bank's target range, should pave the way for another interest rate cut on Wednesday, a move that would just hours after the latest inflation figures are released. The central bank has pushed through a series of deep rate cuts since October.
Lower borrowing costs should continue to boost recent signs of economic improvement in Latin America's largest economy, such as a pickup in consumer spending and falling unemployment.
Second-quarter economic growth beat market expectations, sparking some optimism among economists who for months had forecast a sluggish recovery from the country's deepest recession in a century.
Still, economists said price hikes are unlikely to accelerate anytime soon.
Services inflation, which closely tracks the pace of economic activity, is likely to remain muted in August, according to forecasts, while an abundant harvest should curb food inflation.
""Inflation will continue its long-lasting decline course, driven mainly by ample slack in the economy and the favorable food price shock,"" wrote economists at Itaú Unibanco.
The IPCA index is expected to rise 0.31 percent in August from the previous month, due mainly to a mid-July fuel tax hike. That compares to a 0.24 percent increase in the previous month. 

Estimates for the annual inflation figure ranged between 2.49 percent and 2.74 percent, while forecasts for the monthly figure varied from 0.22 percent to 0.47 percent, according to the poll.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",China August data to show economy solidly poised before key Party congress,"BEIJING (Reuters) - After surprising pretty much everyone with solid growth in the first half, China's economy has continued to motor along nicely with a flurry of data for August expected to show momentum will largely hold up through to the end of the year despite tighter policy. 
Annual growth in the world's second-biggest economy picked up to 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year, as brightening global demand boosted Chinese shipments and resilient domestic consumption helped to cushion the impact of policy makers' efforts to reduce debt and cool the property market. 
The growth momentum has surprised most China observers, especially in light of Beijing's campaign to wean the economy off a years-long debt-fueled binge, with early fears of a sharper downturn well and truly put to bed.
According to a Reuters poll of analysts, over the next few weeks a flurry of data for August is likely to back market expectations for growth to taper off only modestly from the first half's pace, with some such as smaller firms seen bearing the brunt of tightening financial conditions. 
On the whole, the August data set should support views that China's economy will be in good heart heading into a key political meeting of the ruling Communist Party and give policy makers a comfortable cushion through to the end of the year to deepen much-needed reforms. 
China's economic numbers so far have been encouraging in a boon to world trade even as risks to the global economy have increased this year from rising U.S. protectionism and growing tensions in the Korean peninsula.
Strong factory reports last week showed strength in the industrial sector continued through August, while Chinese demand has lifted commodities prices from steel to iron ore and underpinned a resurgence in global growth.
Most economists now forecast China's economy to slow only moderately through the end of the year and handily beat the government's 2017 growth target of around 6.5 percent. 
In a surprising period of stability, China's gross domestic product growth has accelerated or remained stable for five consecutive quarters for the first time since at least the early 1990s. 
POLICY DIRECTION 
That provides a welcome backdrop for the once-every-five-years congress of the Communist Party, which will start October 18, the day before China announces third quarter GDP growth. 
China watchers will likely look for signs of any new direction in economic policy after the meeting, where President Xi Jinping is expected to further strengthen his grip on power. 
A stronger yuan in the face of a weak U.S. dollar has helped stabilize global markets that were spooked by a year and a half of sustained weakness in the Chinese currency, which was accompanied by capital outflows and a steep decline in the nation's foreign currency reserves. 
Analysts expect China's foreign currency reserves, the largest in the world, to have increased for a seventh straight month to $3.1 trillion in August from $3.081 trillion the month before, the Reuters poll showed.
Export growth is forecast to moderate to 6.0 percent in August from 7.2 percent the previous month, while imports probably remained in double digits at 10.0 percent growth, from 11.0 percent.
Double digit growth in China's imports this year has been good news for exporters around the world, particularly commodities exporters, who have benefited from a sustained rebound in commodity prices.
China's trade surplus in August was tipped at $48.6 billion, which would be the highest since January.
The inflation rate likely picked up in August to 1.6 percent year-on-year from 1.4 percent, which would be the first uptick in four months. 
Producer price growth also likely accelerated in August for the first time in four months to 5.6 percent from 5.5 percent, as government efforts to reduce excess capacity by shutting inefficient and heavily polluting mines and mills help sustain a rally in commodity prices. 
Strong exports and a more than 20 percent increase in infrastructure investment are seen lifting industrial output 6.6 percent year-on-year in August, up from 6.4 percent growth in July. 
Retail sales likely picked up slightly to 10.5 percent growth while fixed asset investment growth may have slowed to 8.2 percent in August, from 8.3 percent in the previous month. 
China's money supply growth has dipped to the slowest on record in the past few months, hurt by a campaign to rein in leverage and the riskiest forms of non-bank lending. 
Analysts expect that trend to continue, with the median forecast for 9.1 percent year-on-year growth in M2, down from 9.2 percent in July.

In a report, market research firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their UK construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.1 last month from July’s reading of 51.9.
Economists had expected the index to inch up to 52.0 in August.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that a robust rise in house building was offset by a marked fall in commercial work and noted that new business declined for the second month running.
“UK construction companies indicated that lackluster growth conditions persisted during August,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report, noting that commercial development was particularly hard hit as business activity fell at the fastest pace since July 2016.
“There were signs that UK construction firms are bracing for the soft patch to continue into this autumn, with fragile business confidence contributing to weaker trends for job creation and input buying during August,” Moore concluded.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.2942 compared to 1.2945 ahead of the release, EUR/GBP was at 0.9205 compared to 0.9192 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 141.69 compared to 141.71 previously.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2017 01:57AM ET</span>","Corporate Australia raises wages in second-quarter, but inventories a drag","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian companies doled out the biggest increase in wages and salaries in two years last quarter in a promising boost to consumer spending power, though a rundown in inventories likely dragged on overall economic growth.
Monday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed gross company profits dipped 4.5 percent in the second quarter, from a gain of 6 percent in the first when earnings scaled record levels. Mining suffered a fall of more than 15 percent at pre-tax level. 
But wages and salaries rose 1.2 percent, or A$1.6 billion, in the three months to June in a sign that businesses are finally willing to share their fortunes with workers.
Household consumption accounts for about 57 percent of Australia's gross domestic product, so workers having more money to spend is a positive development.
There are also more people in work. Separate data out on Monday showed job advertisements climbed 2 percent in August, a sixth straight month of gains suggesting the strong pick up in employment seen so far this year could run for a while yet.
In all, corporate Australia seems to be in good shape.
An analysis by stockbroker CommSec shows 91 percent of 139 companies that reported full-year results in August posted a profit. While revenues are up only 6.5 percent on a year ago, profits have shot up over 62.9 percent and cash holdings have jumped 27 percent.
The reporting season has also revealed a more confident Australia Inc. For just the third results period since 2012 capital expenditure was guided higher. The upgrades are big and broad based, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
A measure of Australian business conditions and confidence were at its highest since early 2008, a survey showed last month, as company profits and employment stayed strong. 
GDP BOUNCE
The revival was badly needed as capital expenditure was a heavy drag on the economy last year. 
Figures on gross domestic product (GDP) due on Wednesday are forecast to show growth of 0.8 percent in Australia's A$1.7 trillion economy, bouncing from a sluggish 0.3 percent in the March quarter.
Such an outcome would extend the country's remarkable run of 26 years without a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarterly contractions for GDP.
Yet annual growth is still seen at a tepid 1.9 percent.
One drag on growth last quarter was business inventories, which fell 0.4 percent when analysts had looked for a small rise. The pullback looked to have taken around 0.7 percentage points from GDP growth in the quarter, though it also meant a bounce was likely this quarter as firms re-stocked.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been predicting an acceleration in growth toward 3 percent over the next couple of years, as a long slump in mining investment eases and high prices for key commodity exports percolate through the economy.

The central bank holds its September policy meeting on Tuesday and is considered certain to keep interest rates at 1.5 percent, where they have been since August last year. [AU/INT]

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 04:33PM ET</span>",U.S. economy shows resilience with fewer negative surprises,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy may be gaining some traction after a dismal first quarter, according to Citi Research's gauge on economic data surprises that showed fewer reports lagging economists' forecasts. 
Citi Research's gauge on Friday turned the least negative since early May as unexpectedly strong data on domestic manufacturing offset weaker-than-forecast readings on non-farm payrolls and consumer sentiment.
The Citi barometer <.CESIUSD>, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is monitored by traders for the U.S. growth trajectory. It came in at -18.2 on Friday, matching a level last seen on May 5. It stood at -23.1 on Thursday.
Fewer downbeat reports do not guarantee actual economic strength, but they help foster optimism or at least reduce pessimism among traders and investors.
The index fell to its lowest level since July 2011 on June 26 when it hit -78.5.
The index's upturn stemmed from further improvement in the labor market and a bounce in manufacturing from a weaker dollar and stronger global demand. 
It is unclear, analysts say, how damage to production and shipping in the Gulf of Mexico region from Hurricane Harvey, the most powerful storm to hit Texas in over 50 years, will end up hurting business activity nationwide in the third quarter. They said the same about whether rebuilding efforts in its aftermath may boost growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.
""On net we think the GDP impact from Hurricane Harvey to be positive over time as the activity during the reconstruction phase are likely to offset the lost activity. However, this does not necessarily mean that the economic effect is positive,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) economists wrote in a research note on Friday. 
Gross domestic product in the second quarter was revised to 3.0 percent, its fastest pace in over two years, on solid consumer spending and business investment, the government said on Wednesday.
First-quarter GDP grew at a 1.2 percent clip.

Brazil posted a trade surplus of $5.599 billion in August, the biggest for the month since the current data series began in 1989, the Trade Ministry said.
Exports totaled $19.475 billion and imports $13.876 billion. 
Brazil had a trade surplus of $48.109 billion between January and August, also a record. The surplus in the year to date exceeds the $47.7 billion surplus for all of 2016.
Exports rose across the board in August, from raw materials such as soybeans to manufactured goods such as automobiles. Higher prices of iron ore, oil, coffee and sugar contributed to the record surplus, ministry data showed.

Economists expect a record-high trade surplus of $61.35 billion this year, according to a weekly central bank survey released on Monday.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 01:27PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth slows in August; wage growth retreats,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August after two straight months of hefty increases, but the pace of gains should be more than enough for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start trimming a massive bond portfolio accumulated as it sought to bolster the economy.
Persistently sluggish wage growth could, however, make the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates again this year. The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 last month. The economy created 399,000 jobs in June and July. 
""We see nothing here that prevents the Fed from initiating its balance-sheet reduction plan at the September meeting,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0.1 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in July, keeping the year-on-year gain in wages at 2.5 percent for a fifth consecutive month. The average workweek slipped to 34.4 hours from 34.5 hours in July.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the Dow hitting the 22,000 mark for the first time in more than two weeks. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
August's moderation in employment growth, which pushed payroll gains below the 176,000 monthly average for this year likely reflects a seasonal quirk. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength.
""The August payroll count does tend to be biased downward, typically reflecting seasonal difficulty in measuring the timing of back-to-school, as well as low initial response rates during the summer,"" said Robert Rosener, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
The department said Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, had no ""discernable"" effect on payrolls as the disaster struck after the survey period for the August employment report. Economists say the storm could hurt September payrolls if the disruption from the flooding is prolonged.
The smaller household survey showed a decline in employment last month. As a result, the unemployment rate ticked up one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.4 percent. 
Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 180,000 jobs last month. Still, August's gains were far more than the 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
The labor market has continued to strengthen even as hopes for a promised tax cut this year have faded. 
Republican President Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his longstanding call for slashing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent at a time when lawmakers believe they would be lucky to bring it down to 25 percent. 
The Republican-led U.S. Congress faces a tough challenge in passing tax reform legislation, having already failed to deliver on healthcare reform sought by Trump.
FACTORIES HUMMING
Underscoring labor market strength, manufacturing payrolls surged by 36,000 jobs in August, the most in four years, with the motor vehicle sector adding 13,700 positions.
Employment in the sector could be buoyed by an anticipated spike in demand for automobiles as residents in the Houston area replace flood-damaged vehicles.
A second report on Friday from the Institute for Supply Management showed its factory activity index soared to 58.8 in August, the highest reading since April 2011, from 56.3 in July.
A measure of factory employment hit a more than six-year high.
The employment report showed construction jobs jumped 28,000 last month. That was the largest gain since February and came despite a lull in homebuilding activity and home sales. Another report on Friday showed construction spending falling to a nine-month low in July.
While August's job gains likely keep the Fed on course to outline a plan to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting, tepid wage growth casts doubts on a December interest rate increase.
The anemic wage gains came on the heels of a report on Thursday showing the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months to July - the smallest rise in just over 1-1/2 years.
U.S. financial markets are pricing in a roughly 42 percent probability of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. 
Lack of strong wage growth raises concerns about the sustainability of a recent surge in consumer spending, which spurred the fastest economic growth in more than two years in the second quarter. 
The private services sector led the slowdown in job gains last month, with payrolls rising 95,000. That was the smallest gain since March and followed an increase of 179,000 jobs in July. Economists also blamed the moderation in hiring on a dearth of qualified workers.
""The economy can't create more jobs as there is no one left to hire at this late stage of the recovery with the expansion starting its ninth year in July,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Retail employment increased by 800 last month as a surge in hiring at building material and garden supply stores was offset by continued layoffs at clothing retailers.

Payrolls at nonstore retailers rose only 700 despite online retailer Amazon.com (O:AMZN) holding a series of job fairs to recruit about 50,000 workers last month. Government hiring declined for a second straight month in August.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday as strong manufacturing data boosted sentiment that economic growth is solid, even after the August jobs report was weaker than economists expected.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index for factory activity soared to 58.8 in August, the highest reading since April 2011.
U.S. consumer sentiment also climbed in August from July as consumers remained optimistic about their personal financial conditions, although confidence was not quite as strong as economists had estimated.
""It's more positive data, rolling on what was although not a great employment report, nothing to worry about either,"" said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York.
The Labor Department said earlier on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 last month, below expectations.
Average hourly earnings rose three cents, or 0.1 percent, after advancing 0.3 percent in July, keeping the year-on-year gain in wages at 2.5 percent for a fifth consecutive month.
Treasury yields initially fell after the release of the employment report on what analysts said was a data provider erroneously showing a downward revision in July wage growth. After it became clear there was no such revision, yields turned higher.
“People initially looked at the hourly earnings, the revision down. That’s been changed,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. At their session low, benchmark 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) hit 2.10 percent in the immediate aftermath of the jobs data. The yields rose to 2.16 percent after the strong manufacturing figures. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce plans to pare its balance sheet at its September meeting, with an interest rate hike in December also viewed as possible.
The jobs data ""stills sets up for the balance sheet reduction in September, and we’ll still see a 50/50 chance of a December rate hike,” Lederer said.
Trading volumes have fallen in the past two weeks as investors hesitate to buy Treasuries with yields near their lowest levels since late last year.
On Tuesday, 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) dropped as low as 2.086 percent, the lowest since Nov. 10, on safety buying after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan's northern Hokkaido island into the sea. Besides geopolitical tensions over North Korea, another concern is uncertainty over whether the U.S. government will be able to raise the debt ceiling later this month, as it says is necessary.
""There are still quite a bit of pretty significant risks out there that are going to keep an upwards ceiling on yields,"" said Simons.

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 96.8 in August from a final reading of 93.4 the month before. The result fell short of expectations for a reading of 97.4, according to a Reuters poll, and also slipped from a preliminary reading of 97.6 two weeks earlier.
""The Sentiment Index has been higher during the first eight months of 2017 than in any year since 2000, which was the peak year of the longest expansion in U.S. history,"" said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers.
Curtin said respondents' assessments of their personal financial circumstances are near record highs, fueled by low unemployment, inflation and interest rates, and gains in home prices and stock portfolios.
Few consumers in the survey made reference to recent turbulent events, such as the violent protests last month in Charlottesville, Virginia, and continued political tensions with North Korea, Curtin said. Hurricane Harvey, which has ravaged the Houston area over the last week with record rainfall and flooding, occurred too late in the survey cycle to register a measurable effect on consumer attitudes.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian economy grew more than expected in the second quarter due to an upswing in consumer spending, as a recovery from the nation's deepest recession on record remained on track.
Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent from the first quarter and 0.3 percent from a year earlier, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday.
Economists had expected the economy to grow 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis and remain flat from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll.
Latin America's largest economy slowed from the strong first quarter, when a record soy harvest and buoyant car exports led to the first quarterly growth since 2014.
Still, the report pointed to slow and steady growth. Household spending rose 1.4 percent in the quarter, its first increase in 10 quarters. This reinforced recent signs that consumer spending looks poised to lead Brazil's recovery.
That should bring some relief to President Michel Temer's government. Investors see its austerity efforts as critical to restoring long-term growth, but the measures have contributed to Temer's single-digit approval rating.
Brazil's situation mirrors a weak growth outlook in both emerging markets and developed economies, which has put policymakers on alert throughout the world.
The Brazilian central bank has cut interest rates aggressively since November. This finally seems to be working, but not enough to lift the annual inflation rate from an 18-year low.
Despite lower interest rates, capital spending dropped 0.7 percent, extending a stunning 30 percent decline since the third quarter of 2013.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 156,000 in August, compared to the rise of 189,000 a month earlier that was revised down from the initial increase of 209,000. The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 4.4% last month. Economists had expected no change from July’s reading of 4.3%.
Average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.1% in July, below forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior 0.3% advance.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation rose 2.5% in August, matching forecasts and the prior month’s advance.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer of the new job contracts than expected in August with a total of 165,000, compared to consensus expectations for 179,000. July’s number was revised down to 202,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 205,000.
Government payrolls declined by 9,000 last month, compared to the 13,000 public jobs destroyed in July, revised from an initial increase of 4,000 positions.
The participation rate remained stable at 62.9% in August.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, also held steady at 8.6% last month.
Furthermore, the average weekly hours ticked down to 34.4 in August from the prior month’s reading of 34.5. Analysts had expected no change.
After the release, the U.S. Dollar Index traded at 92.21, compared to 92.53 earlier. EUR/USD traded at 1.1961, from 1.1918 before the publication, USD/JPY traded at 109.72, from 110.12 earlier, and GBP/USD was at 1.2982, compared to 1.2943 previously.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factories across Asia and Europe cranked up production last month as global demand remained strong, confounding expectations growth may have peaked.
The strength will add fuel to an expected rollback of monetary stimulus in the West.
Since the global financial crisis, central banks have funnelled trillions of dollars into the world economy. While policymakers in China and Japan still have their feet firmly on the gas, stronger growth is prompting those in the West to start tapping the brakes on years of super-easy money.
Chinese manufacturing activity accelerated to a six-month high, and euro zone factories stepped up production with the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011. Even British factory output grew a lot more strongly than expected given the country's recent Brexit travails. 
""Global momentum has turned out to be solid in the first half of 2017 and looks favourable going forward. Generally, we see more reasons for growth optimism than we did three months ago,"" said Paul Mortimer-Lee, chief market economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.4 in August, matching where it was in June, which was the highest since April 2011 and well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. [EUR/PMIM]
Along with evidence of slowly-rising pricing power for businesses, the data may bolster confidence in the European Central Bank to make -- and go ahead with -- plans to reel back its massive asset purchases programme later this year.
Suggesting Britain's economy might be picking up speed after a slow first half of 2017, the UK PMI jumped to 56.9, higher than any forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.[GB/PMIM]
That could add fuel to hawkish policymakers' calls at the Bank of England for higher interest rates.
The BoE's rate-setters voted 6-2 against a rate hike in August with most policymakers expressing concern about the impact of last year's vote to leave the European Union on the wider economy.
In the United States, the ISM manufacturing PMI is expected to rise to 56.5, though it is likely to be overshadowed by jobs data due later on Friday, expected to show ongoing solid hiring in August but tame wage inflation.
ROBUST CHINA
China's private Caixin/Markit survey showed new business grew at the strongest pace in more than three years in August. The manufacturing PMI rose to 51.6, from 51.1 in July.
That echoed similarly robust official data on Thursday suggesting China's industrial sector is continuing to prosper from a year-long, government-led building boom. In both cases, economists had expected growth rates to ease.
Prices of industrial commodities and building materials, in particular, have surged in China this year largely due to the government's hefty infrastructure spending and its efforts to reduce excess capacity by shutting inefficient mines and mills.
The third quarter is now looking strong enough that China could sustain much of the momentum from its forecast-beating 6.9 percent growth in the first half, despite a regulatory crackdown on riskier types of financing and debt and a slew of measures to cool its overheating property market.
Resilient growth is not only a boon for the global economy but also for the Communist Party as it prepares for a once-in-five-years leadership reshuffle in October, with stability its key priority.
Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service this week raised its growth forecasts for China, South Korea and Japan.
""The surveys point to resilient industrial activity last month,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.
But he added: ""Investment growth has cooled recently and we anticipate a further slowdown as the impact of tighter monetary conditions continues to feed through. If we are right, the current strength of industrial activity can't be sustained for long.""
Manufacturing also expanded solidly in the world's No.3 economy, Japan, as domestic and export orders picked up. The pick-up in new business was generally more modest than in China, however, suggesting its economic growth may moderate from an eye-popping 4 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.
Other Asian electronics producers were also riding high.
Taiwan's manufacturing survey saw the fastest growth in four months, while South Korea's exports beat expectations and posted their longest run of growth in almost six years. South Korea is the first among major exporting countries to publish its monthly trade figures.
India's activity also unexpectedly rebounded in August, in a sign there was light at the end of the tunnel, with the shock of last year's demonetisation cash crunch and confusion over a new goods and services tax likely to ease in coming months.

But data on Thursday showed Indian economic growth unexpectedly cooled further to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the June quarter from a year ago.

In a report, market research group IHS Markit said that its UK manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.9 last month from a reading of 55.3 in July which was revised from an original 55.1.
Analysts had expected the PMI to slip to 55.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that the improvement was due to a strengthening of new order inflows and that a broad-based expansion was seen across all product categories.
The research group also added that input price inflation accelerated for the first time in seven months.
“The key question is whether this positive start to the second half of the year can be sustained,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit, said.
“This is looking increasingly likely during the near-term, given the breadth of the expansion,” he added.
“The survey data suggest that the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support on-going growth in the economy in the third quarter, which will add fuel to hawkish policymakers’ calls for higher interest rates,” Dobson concluded.
After the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2922 from around 1.2918 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.9203 compared to 0.9208 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 142.24 compared to 142.13 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.18%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.41%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.72%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.51%."
