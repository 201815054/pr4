WARSAW (Reuters) - Czech manufacturing sector growth unexpectedly fell to a 3-year low in June and factory activity also slowed in Poland and Hungary, data showed on Friday, reflecting reduced inflows of European Union funds.
The headline Czech manufacturing PMI unexpectedly dropped to 51.8 in June from 53.3 in May, data compiled by Markit showed. The reading came in below all analysts' forecasts collected by Reuters and a median forecast of 54.2.
""The Czech PMI continued its descent in June,"" said Trevor Balchin, senior economist at Markit. ""The output index is consistent with a stagnation in the official year-on-year measure of industrial production.""
Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary, all former communist economies and EU members since 2004, benefit from billions of euros of so-called EU structural funds, which the countries spend on, among other things, upgrading their infrastructure.
A previous 7-year EU funding perspective ended in December and the new one has seen a slow start so far, leading to a slowdown in economic growth across the region.
The decline in the Czech PMI has been the longest since 2009, Markit said, adding that indicators for output, new orders, exports, jobs and purchasing all weakened last month.
The Polish economy shrunk by 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year, compared to 1.3 percent growth at the end of 2015. The Polish government expects fresh EU funds to start powering the economy once again somewhere around the turn of the third and fourth quarter.
""BY NO MEANS DISASTER""
Poland's manufacturing activity also slowed in June, although new orders and output both picked up. The Markit Poland Manufacturing PMI index (PMI) eased to 51.8 last month from 52.1 in May, below a Reuters forecast of 52.8, but still above the 50 level that indicates expansion.
The data was gathered by Markit before Britain's vote to quit the European Union and some economists expect next month's survey to show a negative impact.
Hungary's manufacturing PMI, which is calculated under a different methodology, fell to 50.9 in June from a revised 52.2 in May.
The declines took place despite a rise in the manufacturing PMI in the euro zone, central and eastern Europe's main trade partner.
""These (PMI) survey readings in Central Europe are by no means a disaster,"" Capital Economics said in a note. ""Strong growth in consumer-facing sectors should help to mitigate the impact of weakness in manufacturing on GDP.""
Poland's new conservative government of the Law and Justice (PiS) part launched earlier this year a new child benefit worth 1 percent of GDP in 2016 alone - the biggest welfare policy since Poland's 1989 start of transition from communism.
In the Czech Republic, the car manufacturing sector - a mainstay of the economy led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s unit Skoda - has remained robust and consumer demand healthy.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Factories across Europe enjoyed a buoyant month in June but that growth could be under threat after Britons voted to leave the European Union last week, surveys conducted almost entirely before the historic referendum showed.
Highlighting another worrying trend for the global economy, China's vast factory sector flatlined as exports shrank and jobs were cut, in a slowdown across Asia that could lead to yet more policy stimulus as doubts grow over the potency of measures taken so far.
The hard times signaled by a range of surveys was not what the world needed a week after Britain voted to leave the EU, condemning the bloc to months if not years of political and economic instability.
""The unimaginable has happened and the UK vote will cast a long shadow over the UK, Europe and global markets for some time to come,"" warned Westpac head currency strategist Robert Rennie.
""A structurally weaker pound, a softer euro and weaker global growth beckons.""
Markit/CIPS reported a surprisingly strong reading of 52.1 in June for their UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), up from May's 50.4. That was the strongest reading since January and better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which produced a consensus view of 49.9. 
But data company Markit warned ""almost all"" the data from manufacturers used in its survey were received before the June 23 referendum.
""Leaving the EU threatens the loss of 50 free trade agreements with other countries, as well as restricted access to the single market itself,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""In short, then, the UK's meager manufacturing sector - which accounts for just 10 percent of GDP - is not going to prevent the overall economy slipping into recession.""
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday the central bank would probably need to pump more stimulus into Britain's economy over the summer to cope with the shock of the vote.
June was also stronger across the euro zone, where factory activity expanded at its fastest rate this year as discounting helped drive up new orders and output, encouraging companies to hire more people to meet the demand.
The Markit PMI for the euro zone climbed to 52.8 from May's 51.5, higher than the earlier flash reading of 52.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth. 
""However, euro zone manufacturers will be worried that demand in both domestic and foreign markets could be significantly weakened by heightened uncertainty following the UK's vote,"" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.
CHINA BRAKES
Among other surveys out on Friday, China's official PMI slipped a tick to 50.0 in June, dead on the level that is divides growth from contraction.
One saving grace was the services sector measure, which nudged up to 53.7 in a positive sign for consumer activity.
More worrying was the Caixin version of the PMI, which covers a greater share of smaller firms, where the index fell to a four-month trough of 48.6 in June.
That had to be a disappointment to Beijing, which has resorted to ever-looser fiscal and monetary policy to support growth and jobs in the world's second largest economy.
It was a frustration likely shared by the Bank of Japan, which found major manufacturers in a morose mood despite all its attempts at aggressive easing.
The reasons were clear in the Markit/Nikkei measure of Japan's PMI, which edged up slightly to 48.1 in June but stayed in contractionary territory for the fourth straight month.
Government data were no better, with household spending down for the third month in a row and core consumer prices suffering their biggest annual drop since 2013.
News from South Korea was relatively cheery as its PMI reached a six-month high, yet at 50.5 it was just barely into expansionary territory.
Indeed, a separate report showed shipments from the world's sixth-largest exporter fell for an 18th straight month in June.
Likewise, electronics powerhouse Taiwan reported some improvement but again growth was only marginal.
India's PMI did hit a three-month high but it remains an outlier in an Asian region which could face a whole new threat should the Brexit vote herald a wider retreat from free trade.
Vaninder Singh, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) in Singapore, noted the region had been the greatest beneficiary of globalization and any shiftÂ to trade barriers or closed borders would hurt Asia the most.
""Overall, what is clear to us is that the impact, will be limited in the near-term, but much more significant in the medium-term,"" said Singh.

""We expect this event and what it represents to subtract as much as 0.3 percent from growth next year compared to our pre-event baseline and expect Asian central banks to respond with another round of easing.""

5,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 05:30AM ET</span>",German manufacturing growth hits 28-month high in June,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Rising domestic and foreign demand, mainly from the U.S. and China, lifted German factory activity to a 28-month high in June, a survey showed on Friday, signaling that manufacturers are set to increase production in coming months.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, rose to 54.5 in June from 52.1 in May.
The reading was the highest since February 2014 and above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction. It also came in higher than the preliminary reading of 54.4.
The rise was fueled by higher production, which posted its strongest increase in more than two years, and new orders, which rose for the 19th month in a row.
German manufacturers also hired more people for the third consecutive month in June, when the rate of job creation rose from May to the fastest since the beginning of 2012.
""With inventories of finished goods falling and both backlogs of work and new business growing, there's a good chance that companies will continue to scale up production in coming months,"" said Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike.
""Moreover, the fact that manufacturers raised their buying activity sharply supports the view that German industry will remain on an expansionary path, at least in the short term.""
The survey concluded that manufacturing will have a strong effect on second-quarter growth.
""Although official industrial production numbers are likely to show some payback from the impressive start to the year, there are only few signs that point to a substantial slowdown,"" Kolodseike said.
He added: ""It is therefore likely that the goods-producing sector will have acted as a boost to GDP growth in the second quarter.""

In a report, Eurostat said that the euro zoneâs unemployment rate dropped to a seasonally adjusted 10.1%, from Aprilâs reading of 10.2%.
The reading was in line with forecasts and the lowest since July 2011.

This was the lowest level since March 2009.

But data company Markit warned on Friday that ""almost all"" the data from manufacturers used in its survey were received before the June 23 referendum.
""With 99 percent of survey responses received before the end of 23rd June, the latest PMI signalled that the manufacturing sector has started to move out of its early year sluggishness in the lead up to the UK's EU referendum,"" said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
""Whether this growth recovery can be sustained will depend heavily on whether the current financial and political volatility spills over to the real economy.""
Economists polled by Reuters last week suggested the chances Britain would fall into a recession after last week's vote were slightly better than 50 percent. 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the central bank would probably need to pump more stimulus into Britain's economy over the summer to cope with the shock of the vote.
Markit's survey showed British manufacturing exports rose at the fastest pace in seven months.

""The big question is whether any negative impact from uncertainty can be partly offset by a boost to exports resulting from the fall in the pound,"" Dobson said.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 last month from a reading of 50.1 in May.
That was its highest level since January 2016
Analysts had expected the index to drop back into contraction at 49.9 in May.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report showed that growth of output and new orders gathered pace.
Employment also fell for a sixth straight month.
Input costs and output prices both increased.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business confidence was subdued in the second quarter and consumer prices fell in May at the fastest pace in three years, heightening pressure on the central bank to roll out yet more stimulus to ease the pain from a strong yen.
The government is also seen increasing fiscal spending as weak overseas demand hurts exports, though critics warn that throwing more money into the economy won't fix chronic woes plaguing Japan like low productivity and a rapidly shrinking labor force.
The slew of weak data came as global policymakers scramble to deal with market turbulence caused by Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union, which threatens premier Shinzo Abe's efforts to pull Japan out of decades of stagnation.
""Monetary and fiscal policies only buy time and what's important is to pursue structural reform,"" said Katsuya Okada, head of the main opposition Democratic Party. ""Three and a half years were wasted as Abe delayed reforms,"" he told reporters.
The Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly tankan survey on Friday showed the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 6, unchanged from three months ago. 
The survey's big non-manufacturers' sentiment index worsened to plus 19 from plus 22, while separate data showed household spending fell for the third straight month in May and core consumer prices suffered their biggest annual drop since 2013.
All of this kept the BOJ under pressure to expand stimulus as early as its rate review on July 28-29.
The central bank added negative interest rates in February to its stimulus program launched in 2013, under which it prints 80 trillion yen ($780 billion) a year to buy government bonds, but inflation has failed to make headway to its target.
""Worsening sentiment for non-manufacturers represents weak demand. This gives the government an incentive to increase stimulus spending,"" said Daiju Aoki, an economist at UBS Securities. 
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter but analysts say growth will not pick up much for the rest of this year as slow wage gains crimp consumption. External headwinds, such as weak emerging market demand and the yen's gains, also threaten exporters' income.
BREXIT NOT FACTORED IN
A vast majority of firms replied before the Brexit vote jolted markets, suggesting that business sentiment may have deteriorated more than the tankan survey shows.
Manufacturing activity shrank in June for the fourth consecutive month, a separate survey showed, a sign Brexit and the ensuing market turmoil were taking a toll.
The yen's recent gains are also expected to weigh on exporters' profits and may discourage them from executing their spending plans, some analysts say.
Big manufacturers expect the dollar to average 111.41 yen in the current fiscal year, much higher than recent levels around 102 yen, a sign they have yet to take into account the pressure on profits from the yen's recent spike, the tankan showed.
The strong yen is pushing down imported goods prices, which may help consumption but heightens challenges for the BOJ to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target.
The core consumer price index, which strips away the effect of volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the biggest drop since the BOJ deployed its huge asset-buying program in 2013.
The BOJ's own consumer price index, which excludes both fresh food and energy costs, saw inflation hit 0.8 percent in May, marking the slowest pace of rise since June last year and heightening calls for the central bank to expand stimulus soon.
""If the government announces the size of stimulus spending shortly after the upper house election next week, the BOJ could ease policy at the end of the month,"" UBS's Aoki said.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 04:20AM ET</span>",Euro zone factory growth reaches six-month high in June,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity expanded at its fastest rate this year in June, but Britain's vote to quit the European Union could cause it to slow in coming months. 
Discounting helped drive up new orders and output, encouraging companies to hire more people to meet demand,
according to Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).
That survey, however, was largely conducted before the British referendum on June 23. The vote by Britain - already outside the euro zone - to leave the EU entirely sent shockwaves across the globe.
The Markit PMI for the euro zone climbed to 52.8 from May's 51.5, higher than the earlier flash reading of 52.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
A sub-index measuring output that feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday jumped to 53.9 from 52.4. The flash estimate was 53.8.
""Euro area manufacturers enjoyed their strongest growth so far this year in June. However, the data were collected prior to the UK EU referendum result, so any Brexit impact is yet to be seen in the PMI,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
""Given the uncertainty caused by the prospect of Brexit, it seems likely that business and consumer spending will be adversely affected across the euro area in the short term at least, pulling growth down in coming months.""
The bloc's economy grew a surprisingly strong 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year, but that pace is expected to have weakened last quarter [ECILT/EU].

Some of June's demand was encouraged by companies cutting prices, as they have for almost a year. That is likely to concern policymakers at the European Central Bank, who have failed to get inflation anywhere near their target of just below 2 percent.
Euro zone consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in June, official data showed on Thursday, even though the ECB is buying 80 billion euros worth of assets a month, cutting interest rates below zero and offering free loans to banks.
But the discounting helped push new orders to pick up at the fastest rate this year. The sub-index rose to 53.6 from 51.7.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 04:00AM ET</span>","China factory activity stalls in June, more stimulus expected","By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector stalled in June, an official survey showed on Friday, adding to expectations that Beijing will have to roll out more stimulus soon to boost the sluggish economy.
While output hit a 12-month high, nearly all other measures showed signs of weakening, suggesting a spring bounce in activity is fizzling. Export orders and inventories fell and factories shed workers at a faster rate.
A similar survey showed activity in China's services sector picked up in June, which if sustainable would indicate progress in the government's bid to rebalance the economy. 
But strength in services is not expected to be strong enough to support growth if manufacturing continues to decline, and analysts are raising expectations of more government spending and policy easing by the central bank. 
The outlook for Chinese exporters, a major force in the manufacturing sector, has been clouded further by Britain's vote last week to exit the European Union, which Premier Li Keqiang said ""increased uncertainties in the global economy"".
The Brexit vote and weaker economic growth globally have impacted exporters, China's statistics bureau said in a statement with the data. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 50.0 in June from 50.1 in May and right at the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the reading would dip to 50.0, a four-month low.
A private survey of manufacturers painted an even darker picture, showing activity shrank more than expected in June and for the 16th month in a row. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), which focuses more on smaller to mid-sized firms, fell to 48.6 from May's 49.2.
In light of renewed weakness in the manufacturing sector and fresh risks posed by Brexit, analysts expect Beijing to take new measures to support growth, possibly as early as this month.
""We believe the government will stimulate the economy by hastening infrastructure investment and urbanization. The PBoC may also cut interest rates or the reserve requirement ratio to boost business confidence,"" ANZ said in a research note. 
Other China watchers agreed more stimulus is on its way.
""We believe an overall easing bias will be maintained to counter the economic slowdown and mitigate the corporate debt burden,"" said senior emerging market economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
""We maintain our view that the PBoC will cut policy rates by 25 basis points this month, and a few RRR cuts can be highly expected in the second half of this year as well,"" he said, referring to reductions in banks' reserve requirement ratio which would free up more money for lending.
JOB SHEDDING INTENSIFIES
Both the official and private factory surveys showed companies shed jobs at a faster pace in June, which could weigh on consumer confidence and spending in coming months. Cost cutting was cited in the Caixin survey, but job losses also could be rising as the government has pledged broad capacity cuts across a range of industries. 
Both surveys showed further strains on smaller companies, a sign that the government will have to continue to lean more on big state firms to generate growth even as analysts warn of the risks of relying too much and too long on debt-fueled stimulus. 
The Brexit vote has led at least two investment banks to lower their forecasts for China's 2016 growth. Nomura trimmed its forecast to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) cut its view to 6.4 percent from 6.6 percent.
A sub-index of the official survey for the construction industry rose significantly as the government goes on an infrastructure spending free, while financial services and property sectors contracted as those markets begin to cool following strong activity earlier in the year. 

China will release June economic data in coming weeks and second-quarter GDP on July 15.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) edged up to 48.1 in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, versus a preliminary reading of 47.8 and a final reading of 47.7 in May.
But it remained well below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis, prompting companies to hire fewer workers.
The revised index for new orders was 46.1, higher than a preliminary reading of 45.8 and above 44.7 in the previous month, but still showing five consecutive months of contraction.
Export orders also continued to contract sharply.
""Anecdotal evidence suggests that the recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar led to a reduction in global competitiveness and a fall in exports,"" a statement released with the survey said.
The yen  has risen around 17 percent versus the dollar so far this year, and there are concerns that further yen gains could hurt exports, squeeze corporate earnings and lead companies to cut production.

Japan's government is preparing a fiscal stimulus package for this autumn. Economists say the government faces the urgent task of reviving domestic demand as slow wage growth and worries about the strong yen threaten to hurt sentiment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. Midwest surged to its highest in almost 1-1/2 years in June amid strong gains in new orders and production, offering a ray of hope for the downtrodden manufacturing sector.
While another report on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, layoffs remained low in June, backing views the labor market remained healthy despite last month's paltry job gains. 
The signs of stability in manufacturing and low layoffs added to consumer spending data in suggesting that economic growth regained speed in the second quarter. 
But a cloud looms over the economy following Britain's shock vote last week to leave the European Union. The so-called Brexit referendum unsettled markets and on Thursday, the International Monetary Fund said uncertainty over Britain's departure was the biggest risk to the global economy.
""The unexpected Brexit decision could have material influence on how manufacturers view the near-term outlook. It could also impact firms' hiring decisions over the coming months,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer jumped 7.5 points to 56.8 this month, the highest since January 2015. The increase unwound the prior two months' declines. 
A gauge of new orders received by factories in the Midwest region surged to its highest since October 2014. A measure of backlogged orders was the highest in more than five years, after contracting for 16 consecutive months. 
At the same time, manufacturers reported that production was at a five-year high and inventories were growing again.
U.S. stocks (SPX) rose for a third straight day, in line with global markets. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt (US10YT=RR) rose. 
STUCK IN A RUT
While the ISM-Chicago survey is volatile, it mirrored similar gains in some other regional factory surveys. Both the New York and Philadelphia Federal Reserve Banks this month reported rebounds in factory activity in New York state and mid-Atlantic region respectively. But their counterparts in Dallas and Richmond reported further slumps in activity.
The Institute for Supply Management is expected to report on Friday that its national factory index was little changed at 51.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Despite the improvement in sentiment surveys, data on factory orders, business spending and industrial production have shown manufacturing stuck in a rut since mid-2014 following a surge in the U.S. dollar. 
Manufacturing has also been undermined by lower oil prices (LCOc1) (CLc1) which have put pressure on producers of energy-related equipment and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang have also inflicted pain. 
In a separate report, the U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended June 25. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong jobs market, for 69 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1973. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 266,750 last week.
""The trend in the claims data has improved since late in May, supporting our view that the sharp weakening in May payrolls overstated any underlying softening in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Non-farm payrolls increased only 38,000, the smallest gain since September 2010. A Reuters survey of economists forecast payrolls rising 180,000 in June. The Labor Department will publish its June employment report on July 8.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Consumer prices rose in the euro zone during June for the first time in five months, suggesting the European Central Bank's efforts to fight deflation were beginning to have some effect.
Annualized inflation picked up to 0.1 percent in June from -0.1 percent in May, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said in a flash estimate released on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected no increase in June.
Prices had not risen in the 19 countries using the euro since January, when inflation reached 0.3 percent. Deflation set in for three of the next four months. Prices were unchanged in March.
June's inflation rate remains far from the ECB's target of just below 2 percent. But any sign that inflation is reviving is good news for the central bank.
The ECB has been buying 80 billion euros worth of assets a month to pump money into the economy and prevent a deflationary spiral. Interest rates have been cut below zero and free loans offered to banks.
It has also promised to take any action needed to preserve financial stability after Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union. The return to inflation and a recovery in financial markets after the British vote may allow the ECB to put off that action for now.
In any case, the ECB expects Britain's departure the EU will have limited effect on euro zone growth in the next three years. 
Core inflation, which excludes the most volatile components of unprocessed food and energy, was unchanged at 0.8 percent in June. The narrower inflation indicator, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco products, rose to 0.9 percent from 0.8 percent in May, another encouraging sign for the ECB.
Energy prices fell in June, but the decline slowed to 6.5 percent from the 8.1 drop recorded in May.
Prices for services, the biggest component of the euro zone economy, rose 1.1 percent year-on-year, the strongest increase among the main components of the inflation index. They rose 1.0 percent in May.
The better-than-expected inflation estimates came after Eurostat signaled on Wednesday that consumer expectations of price trends over the next 12 months rose for a third straight month in June.

Companies' expectations of developments in producer prices also rose in June for a fourth consecutive month, providing the first positive reading since October 2014 and the highest level since January 2014.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2016 06:45AM ET</span>",German economy's domestic strength seen cushioning Brexit fallout,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose in May and unemployment fell further in June as upbeat consumers and local firms drive growth in Europe's largest economy, where the renowned engineering sector sees no immediate impact from the 'Brexit' vote.
Economists have warned that Britain's decision to leave the European Union is likely to hit German exports and reduce growth by as much as half a percentage point next year.
The International Monetary Fund is likely to lower its growth forecast for the German economy in the coming weeks as a result of Brexit, an senior IMF official said.
Economic data released on Thursday suggested, however, that the German economy can rely on strong domestic demand, cushioning any external shock of Britain's vote to leave the EU.
German retail sales rose 0.9 percent in real terms in May, the strongest monthly increase since July 2015, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecasted a slightly weaker rise of 0.7 percent.
In the less volatile period from January to May, retail sales jumped by 2.0 percent in real terms. 
The data came after a survey showed on Wednesday that German consumer morale reached its highest level in nearly a year heading into July, indicating that private consumption is likely to support growth over the summer months.
The spending power of Germans is being boosted by record high employment, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs, making domestic demand the most important growth driver.
BOOMING JOB MARKET
In another positive sign for domestic demand, German unemployment fell more than expected in June and the jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy remained at a record low.
""The labor market continues its overall positive development,"" Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Office said.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 6,000 to 2.690 million, the Labour Office said. That was slightly more than the expected fall of 5,000 in a Reuters poll.
The adjusted unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent, the lowest level since German reunification in 1990. 
Strong domestic demand also helped to cushion a drop in engineering orders in May. A plunge in foreign bookings drove an overall fall of 4 percent in real terms on the year, the VDMA industry association said. 
""A bright spot was the development of domestic orders. They rose by 8 percent,"" VDMA economist Ralph Wiechers said.
Wiechers said the economic consequences of Britain voting to leave the European Union were unclear and difficult to quantify at this point. Any possible impact on German engineering output would not be seen before the fourth quarter, he added.

Wiechers also warned that companies could scale back investment in Britain after the Brexit vote. ""The growing uncertainty will impair investment, but one can only speculate about how this will develop exactly,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's retail sales fell for the 15th successive month in May, as a drop in mainland tourists and weak local consumption hit spending, triggering concerns about a deeper slump.
""Retail sales declined in most segments. While the chance of seeing a turnaround is unlikely, we have to watch closely the jobless rate - a rise in unemployment may point to a further slowdown in the economy,"" said Paul Tang, chief economist at Bank of East Asia.
Tang expects high single-digit percentage declines in retail sales in the next few months. 
Retail sales in May slid 8.4 percent from a year earlier to HK$35.7 billion ($4.60 billion) in value terms, deeper than a 7.5 percent slump in April. In volume terms, May sales dropped 9 percent, government data showed on Thursday.
""Retail sales stayed weak in May...This was due partly to the drag from the slowdown in inbound tourism and partly to the more cautious local consumer sentiment amid the sub par economic conditions,"" the government said in a statement.
Hong Kong tourist arrivals in May fell 6.4 percent from a year earlier to 4.45 million, after sliding 2.1 percent in April. Mainland visitors, who account for 74.6 percent of the total, fell 8.3 percent to 3.32 million in May. Hong Kong is struggling with mounting economic challenges and a strong currency, as the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, mainland tourists are avoiding the city amid political tensions with China and growing calls from radical activists for greater autonomy from Beijing. ""The near-term outlook for retail sales is still subject to a large degree of uncertainty, depending on the performance of inbound tourism as well as the extent to which local consumption sentiment will be affected by the increased external headwinds and heightened financial market volatility,"" the government said. Sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and valuable gifts in May fell 18.7 percent in value terms, a 21th consecutive month of decline. Department store sales slid 5.9 percent on year, while wearing apparel fell 5.7 percent. A string of retailers from jewelry firms to cosmetics have reported weaker sales.  Chow Tai Fook  Jewellery (HK:1929) and cosmetics retailer Sa Sa International (HK:0178) have seen their yearly profit drop by half from the previous year, forcing the companies to scale back expansion and shift their focus to local customers.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2016 05:17AM ET</span>",UK current account deficit fails to narrow as expected in first quarter,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's vast current account deficit failed to narrow as expected in the first three months of this year and remained close to an all-time high, official data showed on Thursday, suggesting the country's overseas financing needs remained hefty ahead of last week's vote to quit the European Union.
The Office for National Statistics left its earlier estimate of first-quarter growth unchanged, in a picture that shows the economy heavily reliant on household spending and services for growth, while foreign trade, investment and manufacturing all slowed the expansion.
Overall, the economy grew by 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2016, in line with forecasts, and was 2.0 percent larger than a year earlier.
But these growth figures are likely to be viewed as moot by financial markets after Britain's decision to leave the EU, which sent the currency tumbling and raised fears the country will fall into recession or suffer years of weak growth.
Confidence among British consumers fell sharply in the days after the country decided to leave the European Union, according to a survey published on Thursday which gave a first glimpse of how the shock referendum result has affected households.
The YouGov/CEBR Consumer Confidence Index, which measures people's economic sentiment on a daily basis, slumped to its lowest level since May 2013, when Britain's economy was just starting to emerge from its post-financial crisis sluggishness. 
Concerns about the current account deficit are unlikely to be dimmed by developments in the three months to March.
The current account deficit narrowed to 32.593 billion pounds from an upwardly revised 33.963 billion pounds in the last three months of last year.
As a percentage of GDP, the first quarter deficit was 6.9 percent, only just off a new record of 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter, which was the highest since three-monthly records started in 1955.
For 2015 as a whole, the deficit was revised up to 5.4 percent of GDP, the highest for a full year since annual records dating back to 1948.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the first-quarter deficit would narrow to 27.1 billion pounds.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said before the EU vote that leaving the bloc would test the ""kindness of strangers"" who cover Britain's balance of payments shortfall, and is due to give a speech in London later on Thursday.
Sterling fell to its lowest against the dollar since 1985 after the vote - something that may help narrow the deficit as it makes British exports cheaper and increases the value of foreign currency returns from Britain's overseas investments.
Last month the central bank forecast Britain's economy would grow 2.0 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2017 if it voted to stay in the EU, but warned of a sharp slowdown and possible recession if it voted to leave.
The ONS figures showed business investment in the first three months of 2016 was 0.8 percent down on a year ago, the first fall since Q1 2010. Ratings agency Fitch forecast on Wednesday that investment would fall by 5 percent next year due to uncertainty about the aftermath of the Brexit vote.
Finance minister George Osborne and the Confederation of British Industry said this week that some firms were already putting investment projects on hold.
But there was better news for households, whose combined real disposable income in the three months to March rose at its fastest rate in 15 years, up 5.4 percent on the year, reflecting both very low inflation and an increase in their numbers.

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% this month, better than forecasts for a flat reading, and following a final reading of a 0.1% drop in May, which was its third consecutive decline.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in June, beating expectations for it remain steady at Mayâs reading of a 0.8% gain.
The increase in prices would be seen as positive news for the European Central Bank (ECB) which has been struggling to get inflation back to its 2% target.
ECB president Mario Draghi rolled out fresh stimulus measures earlier in March, including increased asset buying and a deeper cut to deposit rates, in an effort to spur economic activity and boost sluggish inflation.
However, Draghi told European Union (EU) leaders on Tuesday that the euro zone's cumulative growth may be between 0.3% and 0.5% less over the next three years than previously estimated because of the impact of Brexit, as the U.K.âs decision to leave the EU is known.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output slid in May at the fastest rate in three months to its lowest level since June 2013, highlighting concerns about falling exports and weak consumer spending.
May's 2.3 percent fall in industrial output considerably exceeded the median estimate for a 0.1 percent decline forecast in a Reuters poll.
""The decline in industrial output is directly related to the decline in exports,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Another factor is the slow recovery in domestic consumer spending. The government should consider some measures to improve domestic demand.""
Japan's government plans to announce more fiscal stimulus spending this autumn to revive Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic agenda. Strengthening domestic demand has become even more urgent as gains in the yen further threaten exports.
Output fell in May due to declines in the production of chemicals, cosmetics, construction equipment and semiconductors, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 1.7 percent in June and increase 1.3 percent in July.
Exports fell at the fastest pace in four months in May on supply chain disruptions from an earthquake and slow growth in emerging markets, data earlier this month showed.
The Bank of Japan's closely-watched tankan business sentiment survey due on Friday is forecast to show confidence fell to the lowest in three years in April-June, even though the poll was taken before Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union.

Ongoing Brexit-related disruptions could further undermine output and trade. Separate data due on Friday is forecast to show core consumer prices fell at the fastest pace since the BOJ began its quantitative easing program in April 2013, further vindicating the argument that efforts by the government and the BOJ to kindle inflation have failed.

The YouGov/CEBR Consumer Confidence Index, which measures people's economic sentiment on a daily basis, slumped to its lowest level since May 2013, when Britain's economy was just starting to emerge from its post-financial crisis sluggishness. 
Scott Corfe, a director at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said households were ""highly spooked"" by the referendum outcome which would hurt retail sales and household spending, particularly on big-ticket items. 
""A recession certainly cannot be ruled out at this point,"" Corfe said in a statement.
Britain's consumers have been the main drivers of the country's economy which outpaced most of other rich countries in past three years but showed signs of slowing ahead of the referendum which resulted a surprise decision to leave the EU.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who before the June 23 vote raised the possibility of a recession if voters chose to leave the bloc, is due to give a speech at 1500 GMT (11:00 a.m. EDT) on Thursday.

The quarterly survey of over 3,000 firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) also showed better hiring and a strong rebound in the services sector, which if sustainable would point to progress in Beijing's long-stated goal of rebalancing the economy. 
The ""Beige Book"" findings contrast to some degree with official data and some other private surveys which point to some steadying in certain parts of the economy but weakness elsewhere. 
Official data had shown a pick-up in March but readings for April and May suggested that improvement may be short-lived. Private investment growth has shrunk to a record low, putting more of the burden on state-controlled firms to support economic growth.
Economists have questioned China's official statistics for years and increasingly turn to private surveys such as the CBB and measures such as concrete, steel or electricity production to better gauge trends in the world's second-largest economy.
CBB said China's record credit expansion this year is filtering through to the construction sector, where 43 percent of residential builders reported higher revenue growth in the second quarter, up from 33 percent for the same period last year.
CBB also believes private investment will start to recover in coming months. Its data showed 47 percent of private firms reported faster growth in capital expenditures in the second quarter, up from 32 percent in the first quarter.
Hiring accelerated from the first quarter, with 37 percent of firms increasing headcount, up slightly on-year, though most of the hiring was at very small firms.
Despite the improvement, CBB CEO Leland Miller is not optimistic the positive trends in the second quarter will last, and also has concerns about China's willingness to go through a painful rebalancing process. 
""If they are able to (stop relying on debt-fueled growth and stimulus), China's economy will slow, but as it does the economy will rebalance and they will use stimulus to cushion the rebalancing,"" Miller told Reuters in an interview. 
""You'll have a slower growing, healthier China emerge out of the other side."" 
Policymakers should take the stronger second quarter performance as a chance to push through economic reforms, Miller said. 
""The problem is until we see China willing to do the hard work on overcapacity and some of the problems in the economy, I don't have much confidence they can maintain these trends (we saw in the second quarter).""
Miller said there have been no signs of a reduction in industrial production capacity or employment stresses in a sector expected to see millions of lost jobs over the next few years.
""None of this tackling of overcapacity that they've been talking about is panning out in the data. If anything, it's going in the other direction in some ways.""
CBB added that the fallout from Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union also posed ""significant downside risk"" to the Chinese economy, though the implications will take time to pan out.
""Brexit itself will have little impact on China, but global responses to Brexit could put pressure on export-sensitive sectors and financial decision-makers, in particular.""
Miller said there is no question there was an improvement in the second quarter, but that financial markets should not be looking for a return to faster growth. 

""There's no chance that China has bottomed out. The idea that China has bottomed out should be stricken from the lexicon, because China is on a long-term slowdown. The question is whether they can engineer this the way they want or whether the circumstances are dictated to them.""

Indec also revised its 2015 GDP growth figure to 2.37 percent from the 2.1 percent expansion that Macri's government had initially reported for last year. 
Since Macri took office in December, he has tried to boost Latin America's No. 3 economy with free-market measures. He eliminated currency controls and grains export taxes, lowered utility subsidies, and settled a long-standing lawsuit with bond-holders that had kept the country in default.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose for a second straight month in May on increased demand for automobiles and other goods, but there are fears Britain's vote to leave the European Union could hurt confidence and prompt households to cut back on consumption.
Wednesday's fairly strong report released by the Commerce Department pointed to an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. 
Still, economists worry that financial turbulence, following last Thursday's so-called ""Brexit"" referendum, could hurt consumer confidence and cause households to bulk up their savings rather than increase spending because of an uncertain economic outlook.
""With the confidence-sapping eruption in global financial markets continuing to play out, we expect spending momentum to slow in the coming months ahead, adding a layer of uncertainty to the U.S. economic outlook going forward,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent last month after surging 1.1 percent in April. When adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.3 percent after April's 0.8 percent gain. 
Despite the healthy consumer spending, Brexit made it unlikely that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rate soon, economists said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that the U.S. central bank needed to be sure there was no shock from the outcome of the British referendum before tightening monetary policy further.
In the wake of the consumer spending report, the Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its second-quarter consumer spending growth estimate to a 4.3 percent annualized rate from a 4.1 percent rate. That pushed up its second-quarter GDP growth forecast one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent rate. 
""None of this is likely to matter for supposedly data dependent policy in light of the Brexit vote and the uncertainty pervading global financial markets,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The Brexit referendum wiped off a record $3 trillion from global stock markets over two days. Stock markets in Europe, Asia and the United States have, however, since recouped some of the losses. U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with the main indexes gaining more than one percent in morning trade.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose.
INFLATION BENIGN
So far, economists are forecasting that Brexit will subtract an average of two-tenths of a percentage point from U.S. growth over the next six quarters. 
Despite the steady gains in consumer spending last month, inflation remained benign. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in April. 
In the 12 months through May the core PCE increased 1.6 percent after rising by the same margin in April. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
Last month, consumer spending was boosted by a 0.3 percent rise in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as
automobiles. Spending on services increased 0.4 percent.
Growth in income moderated last month. Personal income rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.5 percent in April. Wages and salaries gained 0.2 percent. Savings slipped to $730.6 billion last month from $753.7 billion in April.
A separate report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell 3.7 percent in May after a cumulative 8.9 percent surge in the previous three months. Despite the drop, contracts in May were still the third highest in the past year.
The decline likely reflects a dearth of properties available for sale, which is pushing up house prices. Housing market fundamentals remains strong amid low mortgage rates, which could fall further in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. A tightening labor market is also supporting housing.

""In light of declining mortgage rates, we think that the trend in home sales is still up,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 3.7 percent to 110.8.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast pending home sales falling 1.1 percent last month. Contracts usually become sales after a month or two.
The index was 0.2 percent lower than in May 2015. It was the first year-over-year decline in almost two years. 
Contracts fell in all of the nation's four regions in May from the month earlier. Pending home sales for April were also revised downward to a 3.9 percent rise from 5.1 percent.
Both March and April, key selling months in the housing market, had readings that came in stronger than expected and the fall in May could partly be attributed to a lack of inventory, the NAR said. 

The overall housing market has been underpinned by an economy near full employment and historically low mortgage rates.

BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - German annual inflation hit a five-month high in June while Spanish consumer prices fell slightly less than expected, in encouraging signs for the European Central Bank as it frets over persistently low inflation across the euro zone.
Economists have warned that Britain's decision to leave the European Union could further dampen growth and inflation across the euro zone, raising expectations that the ECB may beef up its monetary stimulus.
But the German and Spanish inflation data suggested that the bloc-wide rate could rise more strongly than expected and creep into positive territory, Helaba economist Ulrich Wortberg said.
Economists polled by Reuters so far expect the inflation rate for the euro zone, due out on Thursday, to show a zero reading for June after a decline of 0.1 percent in May.
The bloc has struggled with little or no inflation for the past year, caused mainly by a plunge in oil prices.
The ECB has been buying government and corporate debt and also cut interest rates to record lows in an attempt to push inflation up to its target of around 2 percent.
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), rose by 0.2 percent on the year after being unchanged in May, the Federal Statistics Office said. 
The reading, in line with a Reuters consensus forecast, was the highest since January, when inflation stood at 0.4 percent.
A breakdown of non-harmonized inflation data showed that energy prices remained the main drag on the headline figure, but they fell less sharply than in the previous month. Costs for food and services increased faster than in May.
""German headline inflation should continue to rise as the drag from the energy component eases,"" Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said. But she added that consumer prices were unlikely to surge.
""The pace of wage growth is still fairly subdued and will be contained by the very low level of consumersâ inflation expectations, immigration and uncertainty about the effects of Brexit,"" she said.
The German headline inflation rate is therefore unlikely to reach 2 percent over the next couple of years, McKeown said. She said the ECB should increase its monetary policy support.
The German data came after Spain's National Statistics Institute said Spanish consumer prices fell slightly less than expected in June, dropping 0.9 percent year on year against a forecast of 1.0 percent.

In Spain, which depends heavily on energy imports, EU-harmonized consumer prices have been deep in negative territory for almost a year and have not topped 2 percent in around 3 years, weighed down by low global oil prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer borrowing expanded at the fastest annual rate since 2005 in May, but analysts said this could be a high watermark before the shock of last week's vote to leave the European Union spreads through the economy.
Consumer lending expanded 9.9 percent compared with a year ago, the biggest annual increase since November 2005 and up from 9.6 percent in April, the Bank of England said on Wednesday. Consumer lending includes credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans, but not student loans.
The number of mortgage approvals also increased unexpectedly, rising to 67,042 in May - almost 1,800 more than expected in a Reuters poll and up from 66,205 in April.
These figures add to signs Britain's economy was a bit firmer than many expected in the run-up to last Thursday's referendum. However, the result in favor of leaving the EU will cast a pall over consumers' mood, economists said.
""With the wider economy likely to slow during the second half of the year as the impact of last week's vote feeds through, we would expect the appetite of consumers to take on new credit may start to fade,"" said Martin Beck, economist from the EY ITEM Club consultancy. 
The referendum result wiped a record $3 trillion off global shares and sterling fell to its lowest level in 31 years against the dollar. 
Finance minister George Osborne, whose attempt to calm markets had fallen on deaf ears on Monday, said the country would have to cut spending and raise taxes to stabilize the economy after credit rating agencies downgraded its debt.
Fitch Ratings reiterated on Wednesday that leaving the EU would exact a significant toll on the economy, hammering business investment.
Osborne had predicted a cooling of the housing market, a cornerstone of many Britons' wealth, if Britain left the EU. 
Mortgage lender Nationwide said it was too early to judge the impact of the referendum result on the housing market, as it reported annual house price growth picked up to 5.1 percent in June from 4.7 percent, beating economists' expectations.
The number of mortgage approvals rose throughout most of 2015, following a slowdown the previous year when tougher checks on mortgage borrowers were introduced. 
Net mortgage lending, which lags approvals, rose 2.824 billion pounds ($3.79 billion) in May, the BoE said, more than a forecast of 2.2 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
""Higher than expected approval numbers for May are likely to be the last bit of good news for the industry for the upcoming months,"" said Kay Daniel Neufeld from the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
""Stocks of housebuilders and property developers were hit especially hard following the EU referendum, reflecting the fact that investors expect Brexit to have a negative impact on property markets.""
Britain's economic recovery is still heavily reliant on spending by households many of which have been buoyed by strong growth in the value of their homes.

The BoE said lending to non-financial businesses increased by 2.814 billion pounds, compared with a 176 million pound drop in April.

Economists have said Britain's decision to leave the European Union would further dampen growth and inflation across the euro zone, raising expectations the ECB may beef up its monetary stimulus to mitigate the impact.
The bloc has struggled with little or no inflation for the past year, caused mainly by a plunge in oil prices. The ECB expects the bloc-wide figure to stay below its target of just under 2 percent for some years.
The preliminary data from six German states, including the two most populous states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, showed annual inflation edging up in June.
Consumer prices rose by 0.6 percent on the year in Bavaria, by 0.4 percent in North Rhine-Westphalia and by 0.4 percent in Saxony. They rose by 0.2 percent in Baden-Wuerttemberg, were unchanged in Hesse and fell by 0.1 percent in Brandenburg.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT.
Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the state data suggested that German EU-harmonized consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent or 0.3 percent on the year.
This would be roughly in line with market expectations. The Reuters consensus forecast was a rise in annual HICP of 0.2 percent.
In May, German consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent on a non-harmonized basis and were unchanged on a harmonized basis.

Consumer expectations of price trends over the next 12 months rose for a third straight month to 5.1 in June from 3.4 in May, although they remained well below the long-term average of 19.2.
Companies' expectations of developments in producer prices also increased for a fourth consecutive month to 0.7 from -0.7 in May, the first positive reading since October 2014 and the highest level since January 2014, although still below the long-term average of 4.8.

LONDON (Reuters) - Annual growth in British house prices picked up to a three-month high in June in the run-up to the Brexit vote, which has unclear implications for the housing market, mortgage lender Nationwide said Wednesday.
Nationwide said house prices rose 0.2 percent in June - unchanged from the rate in April and May - and that annual growth picked up to 5.1 percent from 4.7 percent, beating economists' expectations of a 4.9 percent rise.
Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said it was too early to judge the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union on the housing market, but a lack of homes for sale and high employment rates were likely to keep upward pressure on prices.
Estate agents had a record-low number of homes on their books, partly due to a spike in transactions in early 2016 to avoid a pre-announced increase in purchase taxes for second homes and investment properties which took effect in April.
""It will therefore be difficult to assess how much of the likely fall back in transactions in the quarters ahead is because buyers brought forward purchases ... and how much is due to increased economic uncertainty following the referendum result,"" Gardner said.
""Gauging the likely impact on house prices will be even more difficult,"" he added, noting the outlook for London was particularly uncertain due to the larger role played by landlords and foreign buyers than elsewhere in Britain.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected the referendum result to push up unemployment and the rates banks charged for mortgages, reducing demand.
""Prices in London ... look particularly vulnerable, given that job insecurity has increased in the City and banks will be thinking twice about high loan-to-income lending,"" he said.
House prices in Britain as a whole rose 1.0 percent in the three months to June compared with the first quarter, the weakest rate of growth since the three months to September.

Seasonally-adjusted figures showed that prices in London rose 1.4 percent over the period, but were outpaced by rises in Northern Ireland, and areas of southeast England outside the capital. Prices dropped in northern England and Scotland.

Record high employment, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs are boosting the spending power of Germans, making domestic demand the most important growth driver.
The GfK consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of some 2,000 Germans, rose to 10.1 going into July, from 9.8 a month earlier, beating a Reuters consensus forecast of economists for the headline figure to remain unchanged.

GfK said the survey, which was conducted between May 27 and June 10, also found that expectations for the economy rose for the third consecutive month, to 18.0 from 8.3 the previous month.
However, the date of the survey means the results do not incorporate the outcome of Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union.
""Consumers clearly see a bright future for the German economy, their spirits are as of yet undampened by discussions surrounding the possible impact on the German economy of the UK leaving the EU,"" Rolf Buerkl, a researcher for the Nuremberg-based GfK, said.
""However, it is expected that the current uncertainty in the financial markets will also be felt by German consumers,"" he added.
""The extent to which the decision will impact the consumer climate in the coming months also depends on how serious the financial implications will be and how discussions develop within the European Union.""
Consumers were more upbeat about their earnings for the next year, with the index for income expectations rising almost eight points to 59.6 -- the highest level on record.
The willingness to buy deteriorated slightly to 54.4, having reached its highest level in a year the previous month.
The German economy expanded by 1.7 percent in 2015, its strongest rate in four years, driven by soaring private consumption and higher state spending on refugees. It is expected to grow by around the same amount this year.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales fell more than expected in May in a third straight month of annual declines, data showed on Wednesday, keeping policymakers under pressure for more stimulus to support a fragile economic recovery.
Retail sales fell 1.9 percent in May from a year earlier, more than a median market forecast for a 1.6 percent declines, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed.
The weak reading underscores the relative fragility in Japan's economy, with slow wage growth and gloomy prospects of recovery weighing on household spending.
""Consumer spending has been stagnant and the trend is likely to continue for a while due to sluggish growth in wages,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""A strong yen will push down import prices, which would be positive for consumers. But the yen's rises would hurt exports, corporate earnings and capital spending,"" he said.
The ministry maintained its assessment that retail sales were weakening as a trend.
The market turmoil in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union adds to headaches for Japanese policymakers worried about the drag the yen's recent rises could have on exports.
""Uncertainty and risks remain in financial markets,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a meeting held Wednesday morning with Finance Minister Taro Aso and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to discuss financial market developments.
Japan stepped up threats to intervene to weaken the yen after the ""Brexit"" vote drove the currency to multi-year highs, but the risks of a costly failure may dissuade policymakers from matching words with action.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is also wary of rushing into expanding its monetary stimulus, preferring to wait and see if the market turmoil lasts long enough to threaten Japan's economic recovery, sources say.
That puts the onus on the government, which is willing to spend at least 10 trillion yen ($97.6 billion) on a stimulus package that will include assistance for small businesses hurt by the jump in the yen.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's double-digit inflation has shown signs of easing this month, the central bank said on Tuesday as it cut its 35-day reference rate for the eighth week in a row.
As part of its effort to get Latin America's No. 3 economy out of the doldrums while containing consumer prices, the bank sliced 75 basis points off the interest rate to 30.75 percent.
In a statement announcing the cut, the bank cited ""a declining tendency in inflation during the month of June.""
By lowering the rate and making local bonds less attractive, policymakers hope businesses will direct more cash toward brick-and-mortar investments needed to stimulate growth.
The cuts in the reference rate signal confidence that inflation, estimated by the government at a 40 to 42 percent annual rate in May, is easing.
After Tuesday's reduction the rate was 725 basis points lower than eight weeks ago when the bank started cutting.
President Mauricio Macri took office in December and quickly dismantled heavy economic controls that had been implemented by his predecessor, two-term leader Cristina Fernandez.
An easing of inflation would come as good news to low-income Argentines hit hard by Macri's policies, including reductions in energy and transportation subsidies. Less than a week after assuming office, Macri removed currency controls, allowing for a roughly 30 percent devaluation of the local peso <ARS=RASL>.
The weaker peso increased the cost of imported goods, prodding what was one of the world's highest inflation rates even higher in the first part of this year.
The government will release first-quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday. Analysts in a Reuters poll said they expect the figures to show a 1.3 percent economic contraction in the first three months of the year.
It will be the first 2016 GDP data release by the Macri administration. He ordered a revamp of the official Indec statistics agency after years of criticism from private economists that it manipulated numbers to make the economy look better than it was under Fernandez, a claim she dismissed.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2016 02:28PM ET</span>","U.S. first-quarter GDP revised up, Brexit risk to outlook","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter but not as sharply as previously estimated, and while there are signs of a pickup in the second quarter, analysts worry Britain's vote to leave the European Union could hurt activity later this year.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, rather than the 0.8 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday in its third GDP estimate. The economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. 
There are indications the economy has regained momentum in the second quarter, with retail sales and home sales rising in April and May, although business spending remains weak and job growth has slowed. But uncertainty following last Thursday's so-called ""Brexit"" referendum poses a risk to the growth outlook.
""The test comes in the next few months as the turbulence in financial markets may affect consumers' behavior and also weigh on business investment,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""If financial markets settle down, the effect of the British referendum on the U.S. economy will be very small.""
Brexit wiped off $3.01 trillion from global stock markets over two days. On Tuesday, global equities recouped some losses, with financial shares leading the rebound. U.S. stock indexes rallied, while prices for government debt fell. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
Economists estimate that Brexit could subtract an average of two-tenths of a percentage point from U.S. growth over the next six quarters, with most of the drag coming through weak business spending as uncertainty causes companies to either delay or scale back capital projects. 
""Following the Brexit vote, we expect a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened financial market strains will weigh on domestic activity, but lower interest rates should provide some offset so that the net impact is a marginal negative,"" said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.
Despite signs growth is gaining steam, economists say the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near-term, given the uncertainty over the implications of Brexit. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that data pointed to ""a noticeable step-up"" in GDP growth in the second quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second-quarter GDP rising at a 2.6 percent rate. 
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the first quarter, the quickest pace since the third quarter of 2014. 
That was up from the 2.2 percent pace reported last month and reflected upward revisions to corporate profits. After-tax profits increased at a 2.2 percent rate in the first quarter, rather than the previously reported 0.6 percent pace.
DOLLAR, OIL CONSTRAINT
Economic growth in the first quarter was constrained by dollar strength and sluggish global demand. Output was also hampered by business efforts to reduce an inventory overhang, with a further drag coming from lower oil prices, which have unleashed deep spending cuts on capital goods such as equipment.
There are indications that the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal. The economy has underperformed in the first quarter in five of the last six years.
The government has acknowledged shortcomings with its seasonal adjustment model, and early this month said beginning in mid-2018, it planned to produce estimates of GDP and its major components that are not seasonally adjusted. 
These will be released together with the seasonally adjusted GDP estimates.
First-quarter business spending on software, research and development was revised to show it rising at a 4.4 percent rate instead of falling at a 0.1 percent rate. Business spending on equipment fell at an 8.7 percent pace as opposed to the 9.0 percent rate reported last month.
Still, overall business spending sliced off 0.58 percentage point from first-quarter GDP. Business spending has contracted for two consecutive quarters. 
Export growth was revised to show a 0.3 percent rate of increase instead of the previously reported 2.0 percent pace of decline. As a result, trade contributed 0.12 percentage point to GDP growth in the first quarter. It was previously reported to have cut 0.21 percentage point from GDP growth.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down to a 1.5 percent rate, the slowest pace in two years. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased at a 1.9 percent rate.
The downward revision reflected weak spending on services such as transportation and recreation. But April and May retail sales reports suggest consumer spending has rebounded.
Should financial markets continue to settle down after last week's global equities rout, consumer spending could gain further ground, also aided by lofty savings and rising house prices, which are boosting household wealth.
A report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence increased to an eight-month high in June. The survey was, however, conducted before last week's Brexit referendum.
""Near-term market volatility may give households reason for pause, but consumer spending should remain a key support for the economy in the coming quarters,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.4 percent in April on a year-over-year basis, a slight dip from the 5.5 percent climb in the prior month but matched the estimate from a Reuters poll of economists.
""The home price increases reflect the low unemployment rate, low mortgage interest rates, and consumersâ generally positive outlook,"" said David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""However, the outlook is not without a lot of uncertainty and some risk. Last weekâs vote by Great Britain to leave the European Union is the most recent political concern while the U.S. elections in the fall raise uncertainty and will distract home buyers and investors in the coming months.""
Prices rose 0.5 percent in April from March on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed, short of expectations for a rise of 0.6 percent.
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, prices increased 1.1 percent from March. 
Home prices in three U.S. cities - Denver, Seattle and Portland, Oregon - showed the highest year-over-year gains, the survey showed.

Gross domestic product was 1.1%, revised up from the  second estimate of 0.8%, and topping economists' forecasts for 1% growth.
But there was a significant downward revision to personal consumption, which contributes to about 70% of growth. It was dropped to a two-year low of 1.5%, from 1.9%. Economists had expected an upward revision to 2%.
Corporate profits were revised higher, and overall gross domestic income was lifted to 2.9%, from the prior print of 2.2%. And business spending on intellectual property products like software grew 4.4%, but had been released earlier as -0.2%.
The more complete data available to the Commerce Department also showed that the gap between exports and imports was narrower than previously thought.
""In Q2, it appears that US growth has taken a step up,"" said Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta in a note.
""We're tracking real GDP between 2.5 to 3.0%. GDI is likely stronger as well given the growth in employee compensation and rebound in corporate profits,"" Dutta wrote.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) is expected to have slipped to a four-month low of 50.0 in June from 50.1 in May, according to the medium forecast of 32 analysts polled by Reuters.
That would fall right on the 50.0 mark that separates expansion in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's manufacturing activity had expanded for three consecutive months from March to May, after seven months of prolonged contraction, fueling hopes that government attempts to stimulate the economy were gaining traction. 
More recent data, however, has shown that growth remains fragile, and the tepid forecast for June's activity reflects worries that momentum in the world's second-largest economy has continued to slow. 
""Fixed income, investment, trade and output data all pointed to the fact that growth in the economy has slightly eased,"" Zhou Jingtong, a researcher with Bank of China said, adding that a drop in commodities would drag on the PMI reading in June.
Weaker-than-forecast data might prompt China to ramp up its growing fiscal spending even further and loosen monetary policy again, Zhou said. 
Uncertainties about the global economy have also spiked after Britain voted last week to leave the European Union. While it is not expected to have an immediate impact on China, prolonged uncertainty could dent business confidence and hurt demand in Western Europe, one of China's biggest markets.
Premier Li Keqiang on Monday reassured investors that China will be able to maintain stable economic growth this year and in the long term. He said short-term volatility in the economy is hard to avoid, but China has enough room to use policy tools to help support the economy. 
The official manufacturing PMI data will be released on July 1, along with the official services PMI. China's statistic bureau will release second-quarter gross domestic product figures on July 15.
The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity, also is due on July 1. Analysts expect it to dip to 49.1 from 49.2 in May, suggesting activity at China's factories shrank for a 16th straight month.

The ECB has been trying to boost lending and last week offered banks a fresh round of ultra cheap loans, hoping to induce borrowing and investment, ultimately leading to higher growth and inflation.
Lending to companies grew by 1.4 percent year-on-year in May, above the previous month's 1.2 percent reading. Household lending meanwhile grew by 1.6 percent, a rise from the previous month's 1.5 percent.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money circulating in the euro zone, which is often an indicator of future economic activity, rose to 4.9 percent from 4.6 percent a month ago, exceeding expectations for a 4.8 percent reading.
Growth in M3, which includes items such as deposits with longer maturities, holdings in money market funds and some debt securities, peaked at 5.4 percent in April 2015 and has flatlined or slightly eased since then.

The ECB cut interest rates and expanded its asset-purchase program in March to spur lending and, with it, inflation and economic growth in the euro zone.

A return to profit growth in the first quarter and a strong jump in March in particular had fueled hopes that China's economy was perking up, but data since then has suggested it may be stabilizing at best.
""The continued slowdown in May profit growth further supports our view that growth momentum has remained weak or possibly weakened further,"" economists at Nomura said in a note.
""We maintain our forecast for a slowing of real GDP growth to 6.3 percent year-on-year in Q2 from 6.7 percent in Q1.""
Profits in May rose to 537.2 billion yuan ($81.21 billion), the statistics bureau said on Monday.
In the first five months of this year, profits rose 6.4 percent compared with the same period last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website.
But the performance was uneven across sectors, with profits in the mining sector falling 93.8 percent from a year earlier, the bureau said.
Industrial profits in January-April rose 6.5 percent from a year earlier, with April up 4.2 percent.
""Growth in industrial profits slowed down slightly in May compared with the previous month, but positive changes have emerged from the industrial sectors,"" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.
He added that profits of energy and raw material sectors including coal, steel and non-ferrous industries saw a resumption of growth in May.
In May, profits of the coal mining sector grew 2.5 times from a year earlier, snapping a falling streak over the past few years, the bureau said.
The pick-up in profits in these sectors might be an indication that Beijing's efforts to remove excessive capacity, particularly in the coal and steel sectors, may be starting to have an effect.
The central government will earmark 27.64 billion yuan to help local governments pay for capacity closures in these two sectors this year.
China's top economic planner said on Sunday that it planned to cut steel capacity by 45 million tonnes and lower coal output capacity by 280 million tonnes.
Chinese industrial firms' debt at the end of May was 4.9 percent higher than at the same point last year.
The data covers large enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.
Profits at China's state-owned firms fell 9.6 percent in the first five months of 2016 from a year earlier, wider than the a 8.4 percent fall in the first four months, the Ministry of Finance said last week.
Producer prices fell at their slowest rate in May since November 2014, supported by a government investment spree and higher commodity prices. On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.5 percent, the third increase in a row.

The subdued business investment persists despite data on retail sales, housing and layoffs suggesting the economy has regained speed after growth stalled at the start of the year.
Economists say uncertainty over the global economy and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections are making companies cautious about spending and that uncertainty is likely to be exacerbated by Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union on Thursday.
""The surprising 'leave' outcome of the British referendum will result in the intensification of these uncertainties, potentially hampering business capital investment,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.7 percent last month after dropping 0.4 percent in April. These so-called core capital goods orders had been forecast to rise 0.3 percent in May.
Core capital goods orders have increased in only six of the last 17 months. With core capital goods orders falling for a second straight month in May, spending on equipment will likely continue to weigh on economic growth in the second quarter.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, slipped 0.5 percent last month after rising 0.6 percent in April. Shipments were little changed in March.
U.S. business spending on equipment has declined over the last two quarters. It dropped in the first quarter at its quickest pace since the second quarter of 2009.
Should spending on equipment fall in the second quarter, that would be the first time since the recession of 2008 that it would have contracted for three straight quarters.
Weak business spending and uncertainty over the so-called ""Brexit"" referendum make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the near-term.
A separate report on Friday showed U.S. consumer sentiment ebbed in June as Americans anticipated slower economic growth in the year ahead.
U.S. financial markets were little affected by the durable goods orders data on Friday as investors were more concerned about the costs of Brexit. The U.S. dollar jumped against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government debt rallied on safe-haven bids while U.S. stock prices tumbled in line with share markets globally.
GROWING UNCERTAINTY
Following the weak core capital goods orders figures, the Atlanta Fed lowered its second quarter GDP estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter.
With business spending remaining weak, manufacturing is showing no signs of pulling out of the slump that started in mid-2014 which was precipitated by a surge in the U.S. dollar.
Manufacturing has also been undermined by lower oil prices which have put pressure on producers of energy-related equipment and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang have also inflected pain.
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Last month, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 2.2 percent after surging 3.3 percent in April.
There were declines in orders for machinery, primary metals, computers and electronic products as electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for transportation equipment plunged 5.6 percent as demand for automobiles fell 2.8 percent.
After the U.S. dollar retreated this year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners and with oil prices gradually rising, there had been hope that the worst of the manufacturing downturn was over.
But economists now worry that Britain's departure from the European Union could spur fresh economic weakness which could hurt global growth, and put downward pressure on oil prices and boost the appeal of the U.S. dollar.
""For the U.S. industrial sector, the outlook for global demand looks weaker this morning than it did just a day ago given the added uncertainties surrounding the U.K. and euro area economies,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale unexpectedly improved for the second consecutive month in June, a survey showed on Friday, suggesting company executives in Europe's largest economy had remained upbeat ahead of Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 108.7 in June from a revised reading of 107.8 in May.
The headline figure came in stronger than the Reuters consensus forecast for the index to inch down to 107.5.
The results do not incorporate Britain's vote to leave the EU as the survey was conducted between June 1 and 23. The majority of replies came in during the first two weeks of the month, an Ifo spokesman said. 
""Sentiment in the German economy improved significantly ahead of the Brexit referendum,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said, adding managers were a bit more upbeat about the current situation while their expectations improved significantly.
""The German economy remains buoyant,"" Fuest added.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters on Friday that he saw no sign of an Ifo index on current conditions changing much in July, adding: ""There is no reason at present to change our economic forecasts for 2016.""
The rise in the June Ifo headline figure was driven by improved sentiment in manufacturing, construction and wholesaling while business morale worsened in retailing.
PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY 
Helaba economist Ulrich Wortberg said the Ifo index indicated a good mood among German entrepreneurs.
""But this is likely to change because with the exit of Britain from the EU a long period of uncertainty begins,"" Wortberg said. ""The next few months will show how strong the negative consequences of a Brexit will actually be.""
The Ifo index followed a chorus of shock and regret from German business leaders over Britain's decision to leave the EU while Germany's leading stock index DAX (GDAXI) temporarily plunged more than 10 percent, the steepest fall since 2008. 
""That is a catastrophic result for Britain and also for Europe and Germany, especially the German economy,"" Anton Boerner, head of Germany's foreign trade association, said.
""It is disturbing that the oldest democracy in the world turns its back on us.""
The BDI Federation of Germany Industries said the British vote to leave the EU not only weakened Britain, but also damaged the rest of the bloc and Germany.
The VDMA engineering association said the vote was ""an alarm signal"" for companies.

""Brexit will hurt investor confidence in Europe as an industrial center. It won't take long until our machinery exports to Britain will noticeably fall,"" VDMA managing director Thilo Brodtmann said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week to near a 43-year low, suggesting labor market resilience even though hiring slowed sharply in May.
Other data on Thursday also gave a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy after it stumbled in the first quarter.
Manufacturing activity rose to a three-month high in early June. Although new single-family home sales dropped last month from a more than eight-year high in April, the trend remained consistent with a firming housing market.
""Today's data suggest that growth has bounced back in the second quarter,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moodyâs Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended June 18, the Labor Department said. The drop was the largest since February and left claims not too far from 253,000, a 43-year low touched in March.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 68 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250 to 267,000 last week.
The drop in jobless claims could give Federal Reserve officials more confidence that job growth will pick up. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank believed the slowdown in non-farm payroll gains was ""transitory,"" noting that ""several other timely indicators of labor market conditions still look favorable.""
""Overall labor market conditions are not as bad as one might assume based on May's non-farm payroll print alone,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data ahead of the results of Britain's referendum on European Union membership late on Thursday. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks rose. Prices for U.S. government debt fell.
PAYROLLS REBOUND EXPECTED
The claims report covered the survey period for June non-farm payrolls. The four-week average of claims declined 8,750 between the May and June survey periods, suggesting an improvement in job growth after payrolls increased only 38,000 in May - the smallest increase since September 2010.
""The May to June improvement points to a lower pace of firings in June. Our June payrolls forecast is 180,000,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
Labor market optimism, which is also being spurred by near record high job openings, was bolstered further by a second report on Thursday showing a jump in manufacturing activity and factory employment early this month.
Data firm Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 51.4 from a reading of 50.7 in May. The rise was driven by a surge in production, which encouraged manufacturers to hire more workers. The gain in the Markit PMI suggests that the worst of the manufacturing rout is probably over.
While a third report from the Commerce Department showed single-family home sales fell 6.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 551,000 units last month, the drop followed a 12.3 percent surge in April, which had propelled sales to their highest level since February 2008.
New home sales were up 8.7 percent from a year ago and the three-month moving average was the highest since April 2008.
""Consumers have not retrenched. The spring selling season was solid ... builders indicate they are supply constrained, not demand constrained,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
""This suggests the strength seen in new home sales this spring may well be sustained throughout the summer."" 

The housing market is being underpinned by the tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, a well as very low mortgage rates.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales dropped 6.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 551,000 units. April's sales pace was revised down to 586,000 units, still the highest since February 2008, from the
previously reported 619,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.1 percent of the housing market, sliding to a 560,000 unit-rate last month.
They were up 8.7 percent from a year ago. New single-family home sales are extremely volatile month-to-month and preliminary figures are subject to large revisions because they are mostly drawn from building permits data.
April's jump in sales was seen by economists as unsustainable and May's drop left them at levels that probably offer a fair reflection of the new housing market.
The overall housing market is gaining steam, with a report on Wednesday showing home resales rose in May to a more than nine-year high. New home sales are likely to benefit from a chronic shortage of previously owned houses available for sale.
The housing market is being underpinned by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, a well as still very low mortgage rates.
Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.2 percent to 244,000, the highest since September 2009. At May's sales pace it would take 5.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in April.
The median price for a new home rose 1.0 percent from a year ago to $290,400.
New single-family homes sales slipped 0.9 percent in the populous South and tumbled 33.3 percent in the Northeast.
Sales in the West dropped 15.6 percent. The West has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories.

Single-family homes sales surged 12.9 percent in the Midwest.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managersâ index (PMI) rose to 51.4 in June from the prior monthâs final reading of 50.7.
Analysts had expected an increase to 50.8 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The manufacturing PMI hit this three-month high amid a renewed upturn in output levels.
The report also showed an acceleration in new business growth that was helped by the fastest rise in export sales since September 2014.
Of note, input cost inflation picked up to its strongest level in over a year-and-a-half.
Although Markit chief economist Chris Williamson considered the report to be âwelcome newsâ, he still noted that the manufacturing sector looked to have been a drag on the economy in the second quarter. 
Williamson attributed the improvement to better export sales and noted that domestic demand was âagain worryingly weakâ. 
âDespite the improvement in the current month, the three months to June has seen the worst quarter for manufacturing in terms of both production and employment growth since 2009,â Williamson concluded.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2016 07:05AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth slows in June as services struggle,"LONDON, June 23 (Reuters)- - Euro zone business growth decelerated more than expected this month, suggesting the current quarter's economic performance won't match the strong pace set at the start of the year, a survey showed.
A surprising bounce in manufacturing activity was not enough to offset a marked slowdown in service industry growth, according to Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Indexes.
One of the first growth indicators in a month, the composite PMI fell to a 17-month low of 52.8 from May's 53.1. A Reuters poll had predicted a more modest dip to 53.0.
""There was some support to growth from the wider global economy, but the countering force of that is more political uncertainty, especially in France, but also in the wider euro area,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
French unions have been protesting since early March about planned labor reforms while Britain, which is outside the currency bloc, is holding a referendum on whether to leave the wider European Union.
Of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank, companies cut prices at a slightly sharper rate this month. The output price index fell further below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, coming in at 49.2.
Inflation was -0.1 percent in May, nowhere near the central bank's target of close to but below 2 percent.
Yet discounting failed to drive growth in the dominant service industry. Its PMI slumped to 52.4 from 53.3, below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll. 
""While demand is just about growing strong enough to generate employment, it's not strong enough to give firms pricing power,"" Williamson said.
Therefore companies were less optimistic. The business expectations index fell to 61.9 from 62.8, its lowest reading in almost a year.
The picture was far brighter for manufacturing. The factory PMI leapt to a six-month high of 52.6 from 51.5, above all the forecasts in a Reuters poll. A sub-index measuring output was 53.8, up from 52.4.
That surge in activity was driven by new orders growing at their fastest rate this year. The sub index was 53.4 compared with May's 51.7.
Williamson said the PMIs point to second-quarter growth of 0.4 percent, slightly faster than the 0.3 percent predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month. The economy expanded 0.6 percent in the first quarter.

The future rate path was raised slightly, however the bank also repeated it could potentially reduce the cost of borrowing to negative levels.
""Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative,"" Norges Bank governor Oeystein Olsen said in a statement.
All but one of the 14 economists polled by Reuters had said the bank would keep its deposit rate unchanged at the current record low 0.50 percent. All the economists expected rates to be cut to 0.25 percent in September..
""The probability of a September rate cut is still at 100 percent, unless anything very unusual were to happen. The future rate path now bottoms out at 0.25 percent however, slightly higher than before, removing the prospect of an additional cut,"" Nordea Markets economist Erik Bruce said on Thursday.
A 55-percent fall in crude prices (LCOc1) since mid-2014 has led to a slowdown in activity in the country's top industry, oil production.
However, fears the downturn would spread to the rest of the economy have been dampened as other sectors have performed well due to boosted government spending and a sharp drop in the value of the crown against the euro over the past two years (EURNOK=).
The crown strengthened slightly against the euro (EURNOK=) after the bank's decision.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services activity that accounts for more than two-thirds of the German economy, edged down to 54.1 from 54.5 in May.
This was below the Reuters consensus forecast for 54.2, but comfortably above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction, where it's now been for 38 months in a row.
Growth in manufacturing accelerated to 54.4, propelled by the strongest increase in new export orders for more than two years, as demand increased from China and the United States.
However, the PMI sub-index for business activity in services slipped to 53.2, hurt by weaker growth in new business and output.
The survey showed that companies appeared to be shaking off any uncertainty over a possible British exit from the European Union. Employers continued to add to their headcounts and the rate of job creation was the most marked so far this year.
""It looks like companies are not bothered by Brexit.
Producers are enjoying rising demand in other countries and are not worrying about the United Kingdom,"" said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson.
""Barring any disruption from the UK vote, it does look like this solid but unexciting growth will continue,"" he said, adding that Markit expects the economy to expand by 0.4 percent in the second quarter.
The findings chime with a poll published by the Ifo economic institute on Wednesday, which found nearly two-thirds of German industrial companies believed a British exit from the European Union would not hurt their business.
However, the DIW economic institute has warned a vote to leave would likely lead to higher export tariffs, reducing German trade and knocking as much as half a percentage point off growth in Europe's biggest economy next year.
Germany's economy grew by 0.7 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by higher state and household spending. Growth, however, is expected to slow in the second quarter as foreign trade cools, the Finance Ministry and central bank said on Monday.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 47.8 in June, little changed from a final reading of 47.7 the previous month.
The index remained below the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the fourth straight month.
The preliminary index for new orders was 45.8, higher than 44.7 in the previous month, but still showing five consecutive months of contraction.
""Latest survey data pointed to a further deterioration in manufacturing conditions in Japan. Both production and new orders declined at marked rates, led by a sharp drop in international demand,"" Markit said.
It said the earthquakes in April continued to have a negative impact on the PMI data.
Strong earthquakes struck the southern manufacturing hub of Kumamoto in mid-April, which destroyed houses, triggered landslides and disrupted production at electronics and car parts factories in the area.
Japan's economic growth is expected to ease to an annualized 0.5 percent in the second quarter from 1.9 percent the previous quarter as exports slow, a Reuters poll of economists showed.
The yen <JPY=> has risen around 15 percent versus the dollar so far this year, and there are concerns that further yen gains could hurt exports, squeeze corporate earnings and lead companies to cut production.

Markit noted that employment growth eased to the weakest in nine months of expansion, suggesting further stimulus may be needed to support the economy.

Companies signed up for $6.8 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down 7 percent from the same month a year earlier and also from April.
ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said eroding business confidence due to uncertainty around the U.S. presidential elections, the health of the country's economy and geopolitical risks have weighed on for business owners' investment decisions.
Credit approvals totaled 76.5 percent in May, down from 78.2 percent in April, said ELFA, a Washington-based trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of Deere & Co (N:DE), Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb),  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Canon Inc (T:7751).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index fell to 52.3 in June from 55.1 in May.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2016 01:08PM ET</span>",Low mortgage rates boost U.S. home sales to nine-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose in May to a more than nine-year high amid low mortgage rates, pointing to sustained housing market strength that should keep the economy on solid ground.
The fairly strong existing home sales report on Wednesday added to retail sales and international trade data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy in the second quarter. A sharp slowdown in job growth in May had cast doubts on whether growth was picking up after almost stalling in the first quarter.
""The housing market recovery is truly back on track ..., which should reinforce confidence that the economic recovery is moving in the right direction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales gained 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 5.53 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007.
April's sales pace was revised down to 5.43 million units from the previously reported 5.45 million units. Economists had forecast sales rising 1.1 percent to a 5.54 million-unit pace in May. Sales were up 4.5 percent from a year ago.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report as investors nervously awaited the outcome of Britain's referendum on European Union membership on Thursday.
But the PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 0.55 percent. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), gained 0.29 percent while  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) rose 0.93 percent.
Despite rising for three straight months, existing home sales remain constrained by a shortage of homes available for sale.
The dearth of properties is keeping home prices elevated, sidelining some first-time buyers. The median house price soared 4.7 percent from a year ago to a record $239,700 last month. The rate of increase has, however, slowed from last year's brisk pace.
Demand for housing is being driven by historically low mortgage rates, improving household formation as some young adults find employment and older Americans move into smaller and cheaper homes.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.60 percent in May, the lowest level since May 2013, according to mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac. Home resales are likely to increase in June. A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications increased 2.9 percent last week.
'TRADE-UP BUYERS'
""The extended run of extraordinarily low mortgage rates is clearly bringing trade-up buyers back into the market,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Many buyers might have been hesitant to give up their current low-rate mortgage that they refinanced into a few years ago, but now are looking at essentially the same mortgage rates that they were three years ago.""
Last month, existing home sales surged 4.1 percent in the Northeast and climbed 4.6 percent in the South. Sales in the West, which has seen a strong increase in house prices amid tight inventories, jumped 5.4 percent.
In the Midwest, sales tumbled 6.5 percent last month. The decline, however, followed recent hefty gains.
While the number of unsold homes on the market in May rose 1.4 percent from April to 2.15 million units, supply was down 5.7 percent from a year ago.
In May, new listings typically stayed on the market for 32 days, the shortest period of time since the NAR started tracking the data. That was down from 39 days in April and 40 days a year ago.
At May's sales pace, it would take 4.7 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, unchanged from April. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Economists say builders will need to ramp up construction of new homes to meet the pent-up demand. House price increases are outstripping wage gains. While that could make home purchasing expensive for first-time buyers, it is boosting equity for homeowners and enticing some to put their homes on the market.
""We expect moderate price appreciation to increase homeowner equity, encouraging inventory expansion and sustaining the pace of existing home sales through 2016,"" said Kristin Reynolds, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Last month, the share of first-time buyers fell to 30 percent from 32 percent in both April and a year ago.

Mannheim-based ZEW said its monthly survey showed a rise in its economic sentiment index to 19.2 points in June from 6.4 the previous month. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 4.7.
""The improvement of economic sentiment indicates that the financial market experts have confidence in the resilience of the German economy,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. 
""However, general economic conditions remain challenging. Apart from the weak global economic dynamics, it is mainly the EU referendum in Great Britain which causes uncertainty,"" he added.
A separate gauge of current conditions rose to 54.5 points from 53.1 in May. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a reading of 53.0. The ZEW index was based on a survey of 202 analysts and investors conducted June 6-20.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a research note they took the ZEW survey with caution but that it was consistent with their main scenario for domestic consumption to drive the economy, with growth of around 0.5 percent in the second and third quarters.
The Finance Ministry and national central bank said on Monday German economic growth is likely to slow after a robust start to the year, expanding at a slower pace for the rest of 2016 as foreign trade cools.
Europe's largest economy grew 0.7 percent between January and March, its strongest quarterly rate in two years, as soaring private consumption, higher construction investment and state spending on migrants more than offset weak foreign trade.

The government expects domestic demand to drive an overall economic expansion of 1.7 percent in 2016, on a par with last year.

The Minxin Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Index dropped to a four-month low of 43.2 in June compared with the previous month's reading of 45.8.
Small, private firms continue to suffer in relation to large state firms, the survey showed, with smaller companies having a significantly harder time getting bank loans and other types of financing.
A slowdown in the private sector has policymakers worried about longer term growth prospects, and state firms have stepped up investment this year to make up for a decline in private sector growth.
The Minxin SMI Index provides one of the earliest gauges of China's economy each month, with a specific focus on smaller firms. The data is compiled from a survey of 4,000 private companies, 70 percent of which are small- and medium-sized firms.
Some analysts say the index correlates with China's official purchasing managers index (PMI) from the statistics bureau, due July 1, though the Minxin data has shown wider swings and has painted a gloomier picture of economic health.
The Minxin index is released by the government-affiliated China Academy of New Supply-side Economics and China Minsheng Banking Corporation.
As with the official PMI, readings above 50 indicate an expansion on a monthly basis, while readings below signal contraction.
The index was first published in November 2014, and has been below 50 since December 2014. A similar Minxin SME index for the non-manufacturing sector fell to a three-month low in June.

The Confederation of British Industry said the factory order book balance rose to -2 from -8 in May while a measure of export orders held steady at -14.
The CBI said the survey of 482 manufacturers showed the slight improvement was led by the food and drink and the motor vehicles and transport sectors.
Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said the recent fall in the value of the pound appeared to have been of little help for exporters.
""It may be that the growing uncertainty in the run-up to the EU referendum, combined with global risks elsewhere, has offset some of the benefits of a weaker currency at this time,"" she said in a statement.
Britain's overall economic growth slowed in the first three months of the year and some other surveys have suggested a further deceleration ahead of the June 23 referendum. However, recent data on retail sales and the labor market have shown a stronger underlying picture than some of the gloomier forecasts.

The CBI survey showed expectations for factory orders in the three months ahead improved to +23, returning to their level of March.

The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding state-controlled banks, totaled 9.745 billion pounds in May, down 3.8 percent compared with a year ago.
Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of 9.352 billion pounds.
The figures could make mixed reading for finance minister George Osborne, who is banking on Britons voting to remain in the European Union in Thursday's referendum.
Receipts from income, corporation and VAT taxes were all higher than a year ago, despite worries the economy has slowed in the run-up to the referendum. But the government's total current expenditure was also higher than a year ago.
The finance ministry last month said an economic shock following a British departure from the European Union could raise public sector net borrowing by 24 billion pounds in the next 2017/18 financial year. In the case of a severe shock, it could rise by 39 billion pounds.
Both the Treasury and Bank of England say the economy is suffering from uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum.
Osborne last week said Britain risks a loss of confidence in its public finances if it votes to leave the EU on June 23 and does not pass an emergency budget in the next couple of months.
Britain's poorest households would probably bear the brunt of a hit to the nation's public finances that would follow a decision to leave the EU, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research (NIESR) said earlier this month.
The ONS revised down its estimate for public sector net borrowing, excluding banks, to 74.9 billion pounds in the 2015/16 financial year, from 76.0 billion pounds last month.
This mostly reflected lower local government borrowing than previously thought.
Osborne has prioritized fixing the public finances since he became finance minister in 2010 when the deficit exceeded 10 percent of GDP. But progress has been slowed by weak economic growth, in part due to problems in the euro zone. Some economists say his austerity plan has been counterproductive.
Osborne is aiming to turn the deficit into a surplus by the end of the decade.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Some Bank of Japan policymakers believe overseas economies continue to pose downside risks to Japan's economy and prices, minutes of its April policy meeting showed on Tuesday.
At the meeting, held on April 27-28, the BOJ held off on expanding monetary stimulus even as global headwinds, a strong yen and soft consumption threatened to derail Japan's fragile economic recovery.
The BOJ cut its inflation forecasts in a quarterly review of its projections, and once again pushed back by six months the timing for hitting its 2 percent price target, saying it may not happen until March 2018 at the latest.
Members said the central bank should carefully examine risks from overseas economies in the future and ease monetary policy without hesitation if needed.
One member said the BOJ's decision to keep policy on hold at the April meeting should not be seen as the central bank changing its thinking on monetary policy, suggesting the member wished to avoid giving an impression the BOJ had become reluctant to ease.
But overall, BOJ members were sanguine despite lowering their consumer price forecasts, saying they could keep policy on hold because it would take time to see the benefits.
The BOJ could soon be facing extra challenges from slowing emerging markets, volatility caused by U.S. monetary policy, and Britain's vote on European Union membership - especially if the ""leave"" side prevails.
""In the past the BOJ has suddenly changed its message. One month they sound optimistic, but the next month they ease policy,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The BOJ is trying to preserve its limited options, but they will have to ease further if risk aversion in financial markets causes the yen to rise and damages inflation expectations.""
In the minutes, members said the downgrade to their consumer price forecast was mainly because of downward revisions of gross domestic product and slower gains in wages.
However, most members remained confident that households and the corporate sector would continue to spend more, leading simultaneously to wage growth and higher consumer prices.
Most members agreed the BOJ could afford to take a wait-and-see stance because it would take time for its negative interest rates and debt purchasing programme to have an impact.

The BOJ also kept policy unchanged at a subsequent meeting last week, but it will face a more critical gathering in late July when it again reviews its growth and inflation projections.

The minutes of the June 7 board meeting, published Tuesday, didn't provide any outlook on monetary policy and retained the last paragraph in the cash rate statement.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left the cash rate unchanged at a record low 1.75 percent at the June 7 policy review and minutes of the meeting gave no indication that it would ease again anytime soon.
""Members began their discussion of the Australian economy by noting that growth in real GDP in the March quarter was stronger than anticipated,"" the minutes revealed.
""Growth was expected to be more moderate in the June quarter, but year-ended growth was likely to remain slightly above estimates of potential.""
In May, the RBA had surprised the market by delivering a cut in interest rates due to disturbingly low inflation. The central bank said inflation was expected to remain subdued for some time.
For now, low interest rates and a weaker local dollar were underpinning the economy, which has in turn helped drive the unemployment rate down to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent over the year to the March quarter.
""More timely labor market data indicated that the unemployment rate had remained around 5.75 percent, but that employment growth appeared to have lost some momentum following very strong growth in late 2015, which was largely as expected,"" the minutes said.

The RBA also noted that tighter supervision by regulators on the banks had resulted in stronger lending standards.
""Housing prices had begun to rise again recently, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. The extent of future rises, however, was likely to be affected by the considerable supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years,"" the central bank said.
""Given these developments, and following the reduction in the cash rate in May, the Board judged that leveling the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and inflation returning to target over time."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers inched up in June from the prior month's three-year low and is seen rising only slightly ahead, a Reuters poll found, reflecting worries about the yen's rise as Britain decides whether or not to quit the European Union.
The monthly poll of 509 big and mid-sized firms taken June 6-16, of which 258 responded, comes just days before Britain's June 23 EU referendum, pushing up the safe-haven yen as risk appetite wanes.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, found the service sector's mood fell in June, due to weak private consumption.
The survey's results suggest a deterioration in business confidence in the upcoming Bank of Japan tankan, due out on July 1, which is among key indicators the central bank scrutinizes when guiding monetary policy.
The BOJ held off from expanding its monetary stimulus last week, sending the yen surging across the board and prompting policymakers to fire verbal warnings against investors pushing the yen higher and undermining the export-reliant economy.
""Due to rapid yen rises, our export prices are falling,"" a manager at a transport equipment maker said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 3 in June from 2 in May, which was the lowest reading since April 2013 when the BOJ embarked on massive monetary stimulus to reflate the economy.
The service-sector index fell to 17 from 19 in May, the lowest reading since April 2013, hurt by weak domestic demand, which has pushed Premier Shinzo Abe to postpone once again a planned sales tax hike to 2019.
""The yen's rise is putting the brakes on sales to foreign tourists and falling share prices are cooling the appetite for purchases among the wealthy,"" a retailer said in the survey.
The indexes for manufacturers and service-sector firms are seen improving by just one point and three points, respectively, in the next three months, a sign of tepid economic recovery in the absence of a significant growth driver. Compared with three months ago, manufacturers' and service-sector firms' sentiment indexes worsened by three points and seven points, respectively.
The BOJ tankan last month found that confidence among Japan's big manufacturers had hit the lowest in nearly three years and was seen worsening in the coming quarter.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell at the fastest pace in four months in May on supply chain disruptions from the Kumamoto earthquake and slow growth in emerging markets - foreshadowing gloomy trade prospects for the current quarter.
Exports declined 11.3 percent year-on-year in May, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, versus the median estimate for a 10.4 percent annual fall and a 10.1 percent annual drop in April.
Exports are likely to expand in coming months as overseas demand shows signs of stabilizing, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe remains under pressure to support growth as further gains in the yen threaten exports and corporate earnings.
""Exports in April-June have stagnated, reflecting disruptions to Japan's supply chain and soft demand overseas,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""There is strong reason to believe exports will pick up from July-September. We are not in a recession, but more gains in the yen would become a problem.""
Exports fell in May on declines in shipments of steel, semiconductors and electronic parts, the data showed.
A series of earthquakes struck the southern manufacturing hub of Kumamoto in mid-April destroying homes, triggering landslides and stopping production of electronics and car parts at factories in the area.
Many companies were able to resume production quickly, but it has taken a while for some plants to return to full capacity.
Exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell 14.9 percent in May, while the U.S.-bound shipments fell 10.7 percent year-on-year.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's shipments, fell 13.0 percent in the year to April, and EU-bound shipments fell 4.0 percent.
The yen has risen around 15 percent versus the dollar this year due to receding expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes, which is weighing on exports.
If the yen continues to rise, this could lower exporters' earnings, which could in turn discourage companies from raising wages and capital expenditure.

A strong yen also complicates the Bank of Japan's attempts to encourage inflation because it reduces the cost of imported goods.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2016 12:00AM ET</span>",China home prices rise faster in May as smaller cities join rally,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sizzling home price rises in China's biggest cities showed signs of easing in May but sharp gains appeared to be spreading to smaller cities, making policymakers' job harder as they look to support the faltering economy without inflating bubbles.
The recovery in China's property market since late last year has been a rare bright spot in the world's second-largest economy, which has been slowing amid weak demand at home and abroad, cooling investment and excess industrial capacity.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities climbed 6.9 percent last month from a year ago, accelerating from April's 6.2 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) on Saturday.
The NBS data showed 50 of the 70 major cities it tracks saw year-on-year price gains, up from 46 in April.
""The average (price) growth of new homes in first-tier cities started to narrow, while it continued to widen in second- and third-tier,"" said Liu Jianwei, a senior NBS statistician.
The southern city of Shenzhen remained the top performer, with prices surging 53.2 percent from a year earlier, slower than the 62.4 percent rise in April.
But on a month-on-month basis, prices were up just 0.5 percent after April's 2.3 percent rise, evidence that property cooling measures introduced by some big cities recently are starting to bite.
Shenzhen and Shanghai have tightened downpayment requirements for second homes and raised the eligibility bar for non-residents to purchase properties.
Shanghai prices rose 27.7 percent on-year, easing from 28 percent in April. The monthly gain cooled to 1.9 percent from 3.1 percent.
""Easing growth in first-tier cities is a good thing, preventing a bubble from inflating,"" said Liao Qun, China chief economist of CITIC Bank International in Hong Kong.
While the cooling trend in megacities may be good news for policymakers in Beijing, the survey showed sharp price rises are now spreading to other parts of the country.
The coastal city of Xiamen surpassed the top-tier cities and saw the second highest price rise of 28 percent. Prices in second-tier cities Nanjing and Hefei also rose over 20 percent, more than the 19.5 percent seen in Beijing.
The spillover of higher prices to major second-tier cities is fuelling speculation that local governments there may also tighten restrictions on home purchases soon.
The government of Tongzhou, the eastern suburban district of Beijing, tightened rules last month on purchases of second homes. The eastern cities of Nanjing and Suzhou have put limits on how much developers can offer in land auctions.
But CITIC Bank's Liao said he did not expect widespread tightening across the country just yet, saying overall prices in second-tiers were still well below those in top cities.
Some small cities which have a glut of unsold homes may even need continued support to encourage homebuyers, he added.
China's top banks are lending more to homebuyers and developers than at any time since at least the global financial crisis, making them vulnerable to a property market downturn if prices overheat.
Investment growth in Chinese real estate slowed in May for the first time since December on a year-on-year basis as tightening measures in big cities took their toll.

China's housing market is a crucial engine of growth, accounting for around 15 percent of gross domestic product. Authorities hope a healthier property market will help support growth, even as the broader economy continues to decelerate.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2016 11:15AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts hurt by weakness in multi-family units,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts slipped in May as the construction of multi-family housing units dropped, but further gains in building permits signaled a rebound that would support economic growth in the second quarter.
Groundbreaking fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.16 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. May's decline followed a 4.9 percent surge in April. Building permits rose 0.7 percent to a 1.14-million unit rate in May.
""Another month of gains in building permits coupled with near record low mortgage rates provide opportunity for a bounce back,"" said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.
Though the pace of home building has slowed after a brisk first quarter, housing remains a pillar of strength for the economy. Residential construction added almost six-tenths of a percentage point to first-quarter gross domestic product, the biggest contribution in more than three years.
The economy grew at a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve left its growth forecast for the second quarter unchanged at a 2.8 percent pace after Friday's housing starts data.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a 1.15 million-unit pace last month.
The S&P homebuilding index rose 1.21 percent, outperforming a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), advanced 1.31 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) gained 1.0 percent. Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers rallied 1.82 percent.
Prices for U.S. government debt fell and the dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies.
GAINS IN THE SOUTH
Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.3 percent to a 764,000-unit pace last month. Single-family starts in the American South, where most of the home building takes place, rose 2.6 percent to their highest level since December 2007.
Single-family starts in the Northeast region surged 12.7 percent. In the West, groundbreaking on single-family housing projects rose 1.9 percent. But single-family starts in the Midwest tumbled 14.7 percent to a six-month low.
Further gains in single-family starts are likely after a survey on Thursday showed confidence among home builders rose to a five-month high in June amid optimism over sales and buyer traffic. But single-family home construction continues to run ahead of permits, which could limit the rise in the short term.
Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment fell 1.2 percent to a 400,000-unit pace last month, following an 11.9 percent jump in April. The multi-family segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans remain wary of owning homes years after the housing market collapse.
Multi-family home construction is also being aided by rising household formation as a fairly strong labor market increases employment opportunities for young adults.
""There is some evidence of a pullback in multi-family activity from very elevated levels seen in the summer of last year, but the strength of the rents data in the inflation report suggests that this is not a product of overbuilding,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The government reported on Thursday that rents in May posted their biggest gain since February 2007. 
Permits for the construction of single-family homes fell 2.0 percent last month to a 726,000-unit rate. But single-family permits in the South rose 0.8 percent to a five-month high. Multi-family building permits increased 5.9 percent to a 412,000-unit pace in May.

""We think the signals from the recent permits data, which are forward looking, are more indicative of the underlying trends. We look for continued improvement related to single-family units over time but some cooling in the multifamily data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices moderated in May, but sustained increases in housing and healthcare costs kept underlying inflation supported, which could still allow a cautious Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
While another report on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week, the trend remained consistent with a healthy labor market.
The data came a day after the Fed lowered its assessment of the jobs market and suggested a slower path to interest rate hikes.
""The economy is generating enough heat to produce some inflation, even if the Fed has worries about the long-term trend for economic growth being too weak to lift interest rates much higher for now,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month, slowing from April's 0.4 percent gain, as gasoline prices rose modestly and the cost of food fell. In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 1.0 percent after advancing 1.1 percent in April. 
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI increased 0.2 percent after a similar gain in April. That took the year-on-year core CPI rise to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in April.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.6 percent. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged and said it expected inflation to remain below its target through 2017.
Although the Fed signaled it still planned two rate hikes this year, there was less conviction. Six officials expect only a single increase, up from one in March. 
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell.
RISING RENTS, HEALTHCARE
Gasoline prices rose only 2.3 percent last month after surging 8.1 percent in April. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, reversing the prior month's increase. Within the core CPI basket, housing and medical costs maintained their upward trend.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after rising by the same margin in April. This measure of rent jumped 3.3 percent in the 12 months through May, the largest increase since June 2007. 
Rents have soared as some Americans, scarred by the housing market collapse, remain wary of owning a home. Rising household formation as the fairly healthy labor market boosts employment prospects for young adults is also driving the rise in rents. 
Medical care costs increased 0.3 percent, with the cost of hospital services shooting up 0.7 percent. The cost of doctor visits surged 1.0 percent, but prescription medicine prices fell 0.4 percent. Americans also paid more for apparel and motor vehicle insurance. 
Prices for used cars and trucks, however, recorded their biggest drop since March 2009. 
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended June 11. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 250 to 269,250 last week. 
Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 67 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973. 
The Fed said on Wednesday ""the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed,"" and also noted that while the unemployment rate had declined, ""job gains have diminished."" 
But with job openings near record highs, both economists and Fed officials expect job growth to pick up after the economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest increase since September 2010. 
""The payrolls data greatly exaggerated the extent to which the trend in employment growth is weakening,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ""Without an uptrend in claims, we remain highly skeptical that the trend in employment growth is suddenly weakening sharply.""
Separately, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index rose nearly seven points to 4.7, returning to positive territory after two consecutive negative readings.
But details of the survey were weak, with a measure of new orders declining further and shipments falling. This suggests that the manufacturing downturn is yet to run its course.

Worries about a slowing global economy and impact from Britain possibly leaving the European Union, known as Brexit, have stoked buying of U.S., German, Japanese, British and Swiss government debt, sending some of their yields to historic lows.
""The 10-year Treasury yield continued its free fall this week as global risks and expectations for the Fed's June meeting drove investors to the safety of government bonds,"" Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said in a statement.
The average 30-year mortgage rate fell to 3.54 percent in the week ended June 16, down from 3.60 percent the prior week, Freddie Mac said in its latest weekly survey.
The was the lowest average on 30-year home loan rate since 3.51 percent in the week ended May 16, 2013, according to Freddie Mac data.
On Thursday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) fell to 1.518 percent, which was its lowest level since February 2012, Reuters data showed.
This week, German Bund 10-year yield (DE10YT=RR) fell below zero for the first time ever.
""Wednesday's Fed decision to once again stand pat on rates, as well as growing anticipation of the U.K.'s upcoming European Union referendum will make it difficult for Treasury yields and -- more importantly -- mortgage rates to substantially rise in the upcoming weeks,"" Becketti said.

British citizens will vote on June 23 on whether the U.K. should remain in European Union. Two polls on Thursday showed more voters favored Britain to leave the EU.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 11 increased by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 from the previous weekâs total of 264,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 6,000 to 270,000 last week.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended June 14 rose to 2.157 million from 2.112 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch up to 2.120 million.
The four-week moving average was 269,250, a decline of 250 from the previous week's 269,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased as expected in May by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%. Core CPI rose 0.2% in April.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.2% last month, which was also in line with forecasts and slightly higher than Aprilâs gain of 2.1%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2016 08:11AM ET</span>",Bank of England says Brexit would pose risks to global economy,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England escalated its warnings about the fallout from a British vote to leave the European Union next week, saying it could harm the global economy and sterling looked increasingly likely to fall further after an ""Out"" decision.
The BoE's monetary policymakers also discussed the Bank's contingency plans to protect the banking system in the event of an ""Out"" vote, including closer supervision of banks to make sure they have access to the liquidity they need.
They said the referendum was the largest immediate risk facing British financial markets, repeating previous language about the vote but this time they said markets and economies around the world could be at risk too.
""Through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spill-overs to the global economy,"" minutes of the June 15 meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee said.
Billions of dollars have been wiped off global stock markets in the run-up to the June 23 referendum and yields on government bonds in several countries have hit record lows.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has faced increasingly hostile criticism from supporters of a British exit from the EU who accuse him and the Bank of making unnecessary warnings about the risk of a hit to the economy from a Brexit vote.
Carney has said the Bank has a duty to spell out what is likely to happen to the economy. Other institutions have also warned of a hit from a Brexit vote and the International Monetary Fund is expected to detail its forecasts on Friday.
The BoE's nine rate-setters voted unanimously to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5 percent at their meeting, the BoE said.
""GROWING EVIDENCE"" OF INVESTMENT DELAYS
Finance minister George Osborne, who is struggling to keep voters focused on his message that a vote to leave the EU would hurt them financially, immediately tweeted the Bank's latest warnings, as another opinion poll showed the ""Leave"" campaign in the lead with just a week to go before the vote.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday acknowledged Britain's possible exit from the EU as a factor for keeping U.S. interest rates on hold this month, and the Bank of Japan said the risk of Brexit is its biggest near-term concern.
BoE policymakers said it was ""increasingly likely"" that sterling would fall further after a vote to leave the EU, perhaps sharply. 
Shifts in the pound's exchange rate around the publication of opinion polls had reinforced their view that a big part of sterling's weakness recently was down to uncertainty around the referendum.
It remained unclear how much of the slowdown in the economy was down to the referendum, the Bank said. But the minutes pointed to ""growing evidence"" that businesses had delayed major investment decisions in the run-up to the vote.
The BoE said once again that its stance on interest rates following a ""leave"" vote would be complicated by the competing pressures from a hit to economic growth and from the expected fall in the pound which could push up inflation.
""The Bank of England will take whatever action is needed,"" it said.

The minutes showed the MPC discussed financial stability measures available to the Financial Policy Committee after the referendum, as well as more intensive supervision of bank liquidity from the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority.

The BoE said it was holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.50%, in a widely expected move. The rate has been held at that record-low level since March 2009.
The central bank also said it was to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at Â£375 billion.
All nine MPC members also were also in favor of this decision.
âThis shortfall is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to attenuate over the next year,â the minutes said.
âCore inflation also remains subdued,â the report added.
Furthermore, the BoE repeated that the possibility of a Brexit was ""the largest immediate risk facing U.K. financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets.""
The minutes further referenced recent behavior in the foreign exchange market and warned that ""it appears increasingly likely that, were the U.K. to vote to leave the EU, sterling's exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.""
âThe MPC will take whatever action is needed, following the outcome of the referendum, to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon,â the minutes concluded.
BoE governor  Mark Carney was scheduled to speak at the Mansion House at 20:00GMT or 16:00ET.

The new conditional inflation forecast suggests inflation will rise faster over the coming quarters than the SNB predicted in March, principally due to the significant increase in oil prices in the intervening period.
The SNB expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters. Nevertheless, significant risks remain for the global economy. Furthermore, the imminent UK referendum on whether to stay in the European Union may cause uncertainty and turbulence to increase.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2016 03:01AM ET</span>","BOJ holds off on easing despite weak inflation, sparks yen spike","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan refrained from offering additional monetary stimulus on Thursday despite external headwinds and anemic inflation, spiking the yen to a two-year high that clouds an already darkening outlook for the economy.
While the decision came as no big surprise, it emboldened yen bulls who were already selling the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve held off on raising interest rates on Wednesday and became slightly less hawkish on the outlook.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda put a brave face, stressing that the positive effects of the central bank's stimulus policies were gradually working through the economy.
""Japan's economy is likely to expand moderately as a trend,"" Kuroda told a news conference after the rate review.
""The underlying price trend is improving steadily so we'll see inflation accelerate toward 2 percent,"" he said, maintaining the BOJ's projection that the price target will be met by March 2018, the end of fiscal 2017.
The BOJ maintained its massive asset buying program at the two-day rate review that ended on Thursday, pledging to increase base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($753 billion).
It also left unchanged a 0.1 percent negative interest rate applied to some of the excess reserves financial institutions park with the central bank.
""There is nothing in recent economic indicators that would lead the BOJ to change its economic outlook now,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""However, the rising yen will place more downward pressure on consumer prices, so I expect the BOJ to ease in July, using all three dimensions of its current policy framework.""
The yen surged broadly after the BOJ's decision, hitting a 22-month high of 104.06 yen to the dollar as well as multi-year highs against the euro and sterling. The Nikkei stock average closed down 3 percent.
The BOJ moderated its view on consumer inflation to say prices may fall slightly for the time being, revealing what appears to be its waning conviction that Japan is on track to hit the ambitious goal of 2 percent price growth. 
NO HELP FROM FED
A possible vote by Britain to leave the European Union was the biggest near-term concern for BOJ officials, and all the more reason to hold fire until after the June 23 referendum.
A Reuters poll showed economists have seen a much higher chance of the BOJ easing at its meeting on July 28-29, when it issues fresh quarterly growth and inflation forecasts, assuming that global markets remain stable.
The BOJ is in a bind. Despite nearly three years of aggressive money printing, inflation has ground to a halt on weak consumption and exports.
In addition, receding expectations of a near-term U.S. rate hike have dashed the BOJ's hopes of getting help from Fed policy to keep sharp yen rises at bay.
The Fed kept rates unchanged on Wednesday and signaled it still planned to raise rates twice in 2016, although it said slower economic growth would crimp the pace of monetary policy tightening in future years.
While Kuroda argues he has plenty of ammunition to ease further, some BOJ officials have openly voiced doubts on what more the central bank can deliver and whether it would be any more successful than earlier stimulus efforts.

The vote on the monetary base was 8 to 1 and 7 to 2 for negative rates.
In the short term, the BoJ downgraded its view, saying, ""The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative or about zero percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices."" Previously it said it will be around zero.
But the BoJ added that ""as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises,"" the core inflation measure - which excludes volatile fresh food prices - is likely to ""accelerate toward 2%.""

Most private analysts had questioned the credibility of government data under Macri's predecessor, Cristina Fernandez.
The data released by the newly revamped Indec statistics agency was taken from consumer prices in the greater Buenos Aires capital area.
Inflation, among the world's highest last year, shot higher after Macri lifted currency controls in December. The move weakened the local peso <ARS=RASL> by about 30 percent, increasing the price of imported goods.
Macri, a proponent of free markets after eight years of heavy state control of the economy under Fernandez, suspended the publication of economic data while his team reorganized the government's statistics gathering.
""It's a positive development in that they are resuming the publication of data. It's another step toward the normalization of the economy,"" said Alberto Ramos, head of emerging markets research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York.
The headline number of 4.2 percent underscores the urgent need to slow the increase in consumer prices as soon as possible, Ramos added.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 03:55PM ET</span>","Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, signals lower rate path going forward","By Jason Lange and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and signaled it still planned two hikes this year, although a slowing economic growth path for 2016 and 2017 prompted a downgrade in where the U.S. central bank thought rates would peak.
Even this year's rates projection was less secure than previously, however. Six of the Fed's 17 individual forecasts from governors and regional Fed presidents projected just one hike this year, compared with one such outlook when the forecasts were last issued three months ago.
""We are quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term,"" Fed Chair Janet Yellen told a news conference after the rate decision.
The U.S. central bank lowered its economic growth forecast for 2016 to 2.0 percent growth from 2.2 percent and its outlook for 2017 to 2.0 percent from 2.1 percent.
It also cut its longer term view of the appropriate federal funds rate by a quarter point to 3 percent and indicated it would be less aggressive in tightening monetary policy after the end of this year.
Yellen gave no clues as to whether a rate hike could come as early as the Fed's next rate-setting meeting in July, or whether the central bank would wait for a slew of firmer data as it headed into its September meeting. Markets have all but priced out any rate rise in 2016.
""While the recent labor market data have on balance been disappointing, it's important not to overreact to one or two monthly readings,"" she said, adding the Fed expected jobs to strengthen further.
Policymakers have been worried about potential weakness in the U.S. labor market and the possibility of financial turmoil if Britain votes next week to leave the European Union.
Yellen acknowledged ""Brexit"" was one of the factors in Wednesday's rate decision and said Britain's decision whether to remain or leave the European Union would have ""consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets"".
A DOVISH SETUP, SIGNALING CONCERNS OVER FUTURE GROWTH
Financial markets all but priced out a rate increase this year after the Fed statement, and U.S. short-term interest rate futures contracts rose. U.S. stocks held on to their pre-meeting gains.
Even steady Fed hawks backed away from pushing for a hike at Wednesday's meeting, analysts noted.
""It's as dovish as the Fed can get without actually cutting rates. Even (Kansas City Fed President) Esther George withdrew her dissent. The path of rates is lower, which is a big dovish swing,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Fund Management.
The Fed has implemented just one rate rise in a decade and its target range for overnight lending rates between banks remained between 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent.
It raised rates in December and initially signaled four increases were likely for 2016. Concerns about a global economic slowdown and volatility in financial markets subsequently reduced that number to two.
Although worries about the health of the global economy have eased, a sharp slowdown in U.S. hiring in May was unsettling. More recent data have indicated that last month's jobs report may have been a blip.
The Fed statement said economic activity appeared to have picked up since April.

Economists polled by Reuters had seen virtually no chance that the Fed would raise rates on Wednesday. Most had expected it to do so in July or September on a view that the U.S. job market would bounce back and Britain's EU referendum would not lead to a financial meltdown.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 02:25PM ET</span>",Slumping autos weigh on U.S. manufacturing output; inflation tame,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in May as motor vehicles and parts production recorded its biggest drop in nearly 2-1/2 years, suggesting sustained weakness in the sector even as the overall economy appears to be gaining momentum.
Other data on Wednesday showed underlying producer prices were subdued last month amid weakness in costs for health services, indicating inflation could remain tame for a while.
Against the back drop of weak manufacturing, benign inflation and a recent sharp slowdown in employment gains, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged. The U.S. central bank, however, signaled it still planned two rate hikes this year.
""The disappointing manufacturing output points to continued sluggishness in this segment of the economy and will likely remain a source of concern at the Fed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent last month after increasing by a downwardly revised 0.2 percent in April, the Fed said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production unchanged in May after a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in April.
The drop in production pushed manufacturing capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, to a more than two-year low.
Motor vehicle and parts production slumped 4.2 percent last month, the largest fall since January 2014. But economists said the drop was likely temporary, citing strong auto sales and well-managed motor vehicle inventories.
There were also declines in the output of machinery and wood products. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and sluggish overseas demand.
Factories also have been hurt by deep spending cuts on capital projects in the energy sector in response to lower oil prices, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.
The manufacturing weakness contrasted sharply with recent fairly strong retail sales and housing data that suggested the economy had regained speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.
Although production at mines rose 0.2 percent in May after eight straight monthly declines, oil and well gas drilling tumbled 7.9 percent.
GLIMMERS OF HOPE
There are signs, however, that the worst for the manufacturing sector is over. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State business conditions index increased 15 points to 6.0 in June as new orders and shipments also swung into positive territory.
""The tone of the Empire State survey suggests that we are moving past the recent weakness in the manufacturing sector,"" said Daniel Silver, economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose on the Fed interest rate decision, while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street traded higher.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month as energy costs surged after rising 0.2 percent in April.
In the 12 months through May, the PPI slipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in April.
A 2.8 percent jump in energy prices accounted for two-thirds of the 0.7 percent rise in the cost of goods in May.
While overall prices for services rose 0.2 percent, healthcare costs slipped 0.1 percent. The cost of doctor visits fell 0.3 percent and home healthcare services dropped 0.9 percent. Economists believe that could translate into soft healthcare costs in the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
As a result of the weak healthcare costs, the so-called core PPI, which excludes food, energy and trade services, dipped 0.1 percent in May after rising 0.3 percent in April.
The core PPI was up 0.8 percent in the 12 months through May after increasing 0.9 percent in the 12 months through April.

""The underlying move in producer prices ... points to risks of a more moderate upward path in inflation than expected,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

Citing a slowing labor market and subdued inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. It represented the first rate hike by the Fed in nearly a decade. There were no dissents in June's monetary policy statement; previously Kansas City Federal Reserve president Esther George dissented in the Fed's prior two meetings. 
""The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen,"" the FOMC said in the statement. ""Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.""
While the FOMC left its median Federal Funds Rate forecast for 2016 unchanged at 0.9%, six members of the FOMC recommended just one rate hike by the end of the year. In the FOMC's last projections in March, only one member of the Committee recommended a single rate hike in 2016. By comparison, the FOMC said in median projections in December that it could implement as many as four rate hikes this year.
On a long-term basis, the FOMC lowered its median projection for the Fed Funds Rate in 2017 by 0.25% to 1.6%. The FOMC also cut the median projection on the Fed Funds Rate outlook for 2018 by 0.625% to 2.4%.
Following the release, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 17,753.92, up approximately 70 points on the day, while the S&P 500 Composite gained more than eight points to 2,075.12. Both indices were relatively flat before the Fed issued its statement. Both the Dow and S&P 500 closed down by more than 0.15% on the session, following a late sell-off over the final half-hour of Wednesday's session. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other currencies, lost more than 0.55% to an intraday low of 94.48, extending slight losses earlier in the session. The index has crashed more than 5% since early-December.
EUR/USD gained more than 0.6% to 1.128, moving slightly upward following the release. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year, meanwhile, fell four basis points to 1.57%, remaining near one-month lows.

Industrial output declined 0.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production slipping 0.2 percent last month.
The industrial sector measured by the U.S. central bank comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
It has shown tentative signs of green shoots after a downturn over the past 18 months that was due to weak global demand, a strong dollar and fall in oil prices.
However, the data showed that despite the dollar's rally fizzling out and a rise in oil prices, industrial production remains tepid across the board.
Last month, manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent and the output of consumer goods declined 0.7 percent. A 2.2 percent drop in consumer durables reflected fewer automotive products but also declines for home electronics, appliances and furniture, the Fed said.
Business equipment spending also faltered, down 0.7 percent. The Fed has become increasingly worried about soft business investment.
The index for utilities fell 1.0 percent. Mining rose 0.2 percent due to a ramping up in coal mining while oil and gas extraction was little changed.
With overall output decreasing, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell 0.4 percentage points in May to 74.9 percent, from a downwardly revised 75.3 percent in April.

The Fed sees capacity use as a leading indicator in deciding how much further the economy can grow before sparking higher inflation.

Producer prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% last month the Commerce Department said, against forecasts for the 0.1% increase to remain at the levels seen in April.
The producer price index was down 0.1% from a year earlier, in line with expectations and compared to lack of change seen the prior month. That was its first annual decline since October, suggesting that inflation may not be rising.

Core producer prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.2% last month, above expectations for 1.0% advance and compared to the prior gain of 0.9%.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2016 12:47PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales point to strong domestic demand,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose strongly in May as Americans bought automobiles and a range of other goods, even as they paid more for gasoline, suggesting that economic growth was gaining steam despite a sharp slowdown in job creation. 
Other data on Tuesday hinted at a steady build-up of inflation pressures, with import prices recording their largest increase in just over four years in May as the drag from a strong dollar and lower oil prices fades. 
""As has been the case in the prior two years, the modest first-quarter disappointment in consumer spending now appears to be a short-lived soft patch,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""This number also lends credence to the idea that the big miss on May payrolls may have been sending an overly pessimistic signal on growth.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.5 percent last month after surging by an unrevised 1.3 percent in April. The second straight month of gains boosted sales 2.5 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose a solid 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent increase in April. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have risen 0.9 percent in April. Economists had forecast both overall retail and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices increased 1.4 percent last month, the largest rise since March 2012, after advancing 0.7 percent in April. In the 12 months through May, import prices fell 5.0 percent, the smallest decline since November 2014. 
The dollar's surge and a plunge in oil prices between June 2014 and December 2015 had dampened inflation. But with the dollar weakening 1.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year and oil prices near $50 per barrel, that drag is starting to lift.
The signs of fairly healthy domestic demand and rising imported inflation will likely be welcomed by officials at the Federal Reserve, who convene for a two-day meeting starting on Tuesday.
While May's weak employment report has all but ruled out an interest rate increase at this meeting, the steady flow of upbeat economic reports keeps a hike in July on the table. The economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest gain since September 2010. 
""This won't spur the Fed to raise interest rates tomorrow, but it could cast a more positive tone on the statement... setting the stage for an increase in July,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell. Prices for U.S. government debt rose marginally.
STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING EYED
Economists said based on May's broad increase in retail sales, consumer spending in the second quarter was growing between a 3 percent and 4 percent annualized rate. 
As a result, the Atlanta Fed raised its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.8 percent rate. The economy grew at a 0.8 percent rate in the first quarter.
Strong sales are also helping businesses reduce an inventory overhang. While that will hurt GDP growth in the short-term, it should give businesses room to order more goods from factories in the future and boost production. 
In another report, the Commerce Department said inventories gained 0.1 percent in April after rising 0.3 percent in March.
Business sales rose 0.9 percent in April, the largest increase since February 2014, advancing for a second straight month. 
Retail sales in May were buoyed by a 0.5 percent increase in auto sales. Receipts at service stations increased 2.1 percent, reflecting recent increases in gasoline prices. 
Americans also bought clothing and spent on online purchases. They boosted discretionary spending, splurging on sporting goods and hobbies, frequenting restaurants and bars, and buying electronics and appliances. 

But households cut back on purchases of building materials and garden equipment, as well as furniture.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday inventories gained 0.1 percent after a downwardly revised 0.3 percent rise in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, gaining 0.2 percent in April after a previously reported 0.4 percent increase in March.
Auto inventories ticked up 0.1 percent after surging 2.3percent in March. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.2 percent in April. That was the largest drop in nearly a year and followed a 0.1 percent gain in March.
Inventories last contributed to GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015 and have been a drag in each of the last three quarters. Businesses accumulated record inventory in the first half of 2015, which outstripped demand.
Though the pace of accumulation slowed, inventories remained high in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
Business sales rose 0.9 percent in April, the largest increase since February 2014, after gaining 0.2 percent in March.
At April's sales pace, it would take 1.40 months for businesses to clear shelves. The was the smallest since last December and was down from 1.41 months in March.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said on Tuesday its small business optimism index rose 0.2 point to a reading of 93.8 last month.
Although it was the second straight monthly increase in the index, it remained below the 100 reading in December 2014 and its 42-year average of 98. About 700 small business owners participated in the survey.
Weak spending on capital goods such as machinery, and a slow pace of inventory accumulation, have been a drag on economic growth. Four components of the NFIB index rose last month, while another four fell and two were unchanged.
Worries about anemic sales ranked high among small business owners. Fourteen percent of owners said weak sales were their main business problem, up three points from April.
The share of owners reporting an increase in sales in the past three months fell two percentage points compared to the prior quarter. The share of owners expecting higher sales was unchanged.
Given the pessimism over sales, businesses remained hesitant to increase inventory. There was a decline in the share of owners reporting an increase in inventory as well as those planning to build stocks.
""These weak inventory investment readings are consistent with the rather poor performance of consumer spending in the first quarter, leaving owners with excessive stocks and no incentive to add to them,"" said the NFIB.
Fifty-eight percent of small business owners reported capital investment, down two points from April. The share of owners planning capital spending in the next 3 to 6 months also fell two points.
Small businesses continued to report difficulties finding qualified workers for open positions. Fifty-six percent of owners reported hiring or trying to hire, up three points, but 48 percent reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.
While the share of all owners saying they had job openings they could not fill fell two points, it remained at higher levels. Fifteen percent of owners reported using temporary workers, up two points from April and five points from March.

""Overall, it appears that labor markets are tightening,"" the NFIB said.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2016 05:40AM ET</span>",Euro zone April industry output rebounds in good sign for overall growth,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production rebounded in April on a monthly basis after two consecutive falls, rising more than expected mostly because of a surge in the output of durable consumer goods, such as cars, the European Union statistics office said on Tuesday.
Industrial production in the 19-member single currency bloc was 1.1 percent higher in April than in March, above the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists of a 0.8 percent rise.
The figure sends a message of confidence about the euro zone economy and inverts the negative trend started in February, when output decreased by 1.2 percent, and continued in March which recorded a slightly upwardly revised 0.7 percent drop in industrial production (from a previous estimate of -0.8 percent).
Year-on-year, euro zone industrial output rose in April by 2.0 percent, also in this case significantly more than market estimates of a 1.4 percent increase, and much more than the 0.2 percent growth recorded the previous month.
Euro zone April monthly output increased mostly because of the output of consumer durable goods, such as cars and fridges, which rose 2.3 percent after a 0.8 percent drop the previous month.
All other sectors recorded increases in production. Output of capital goods, such as machinery, went up by 1.9 percent, and production of non-durable consumer goods increased 1.6 percent.
Output of energy products increased 0.3 percent and production of intermediate goods rose 0.4 percent.
The two largest economies of the euro zone saw a rebound in their April monthly output after two months of fall, with production in Germany growing by 1.1 percent, and in France by 1.2 percent. Italian industrial production increased 0.5 percent, after having being flat in March.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2016 04:50AM ET</span>","UK inflation slightly weaker than expected, steady at +0.3 percent","LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - British inflation held steady in May against expectations for a small increase, as continued falls in clothing prices offset pressure from fuel prices, official data showed on Tuesday.
Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said, and slightly below economists' expectation for a 0.4 percent annual rise.
Overall, the figures underlined the lack of inflationary pressure in Britain's economy, with inflation holding at 0.3 percent throughout 2016 with the exception of March.
British inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2 percent target for more than two years and last year it was zero, the lowest since comparable records began in 1950.
Still, BoE policymakers are unlikely to put too weight on the inflation data when they meet this week, given the uncertainty created by next week's referendum on Britain's European Union membership.
In May the Bank of England forecast inflation would stay below 1 percent until almost the end of the year and to undershoot its target until 2018, due to the global slump in oil prices, the effect of past rises in sterling and lacklustre wage growth.
Clothing and footwear prices fell 0.4 percent on the year, with British retailers competing hard for custom. Food and beverage prices continued to weigh on inflation.
There were signs that the fall in oil prices is gradually starting to filter out from the annual inflation rate. Prices paid by factories for materials and fuel fell 3.9 percent, the smallest decline since May 2014.
British drivers also paid more in fuel prices on the month, which contributed to the upward pressure on overall inflation exerted by the transport sector.
North Sea oil prices rose around 3 percent in dollar terms in May and rallied further in June, to hit an 8-month high last week.
But a lack of underlying domestic price pressures, as well as fears that uncertain global demand and jittery stock markets might sap the strength of Britain's moderate recovery, mean few economists expect the BoE to raise rates before early next year.
Many in financial markets think it could take much longer, and see a decent chance that the BoE could instead be forced to cut rates below the record-low 0.5 percent where they have languished for almost seven years, especially if the country votes to leave the EU in next week's referendum.
But the central bank has said it expects sterling to fall and inflation to lurch higher after a vote for Brexit, and that it is hard to say in advance which would be the right direction to move rates.
An ONS measure of core consumer price inflation -- which strips out changes in the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco -- held steady at 1.2 percent, compared with economists' expectations for it to rise slightly to 1.3 percent.
Expectations among people in Britain for inflation over the coming year slipped in May to 1.5 percent according to a YouGov survey, but a separate BoE poll showed them rising to 2.0 percent.
Factory gate prices fell 0.7 percent on the year compared with forecasts of a 0.5 percent annual drop.
The ONS also launched a single official measure of house prices, replacing separate data from the ONS and Land Registry.
This showed house prices increased by 8.2 percent in annual terms across the United Kingdom as a whole, compared with an 8.5 percent rise in March.
Prices in London alone rose 14.5 percent compared with a year ago. A shortage in housing supply is expected to keep the market under pressure, though in the short-term the referendum and a tax rise on purchases of property to rent out has hit demand.

Some 247,700 homes were built last year, up 1 percent from the previous year, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday -- the highest since the 255,600 that were built in 2006.
Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks has said at least 350,000 new homes must be built annually, while the building industry has said 400,000 are needed.

Last year more than 1 million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere arrived in Germany. As they gradually move out of shelters and into more permanent accommodation, demand for homes is expected to pick up even more in a market where Germans are increasingly buying property, spurred by low mortgage rates.

Factory output grew 6 percent in May from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth to ease slightly to 5.9 percent from 6 percent in April.
Analysts believe industrial output has been supported by a government infrastructure spending spree and a further recovery in the property market.
Fixed-asset investment growth fell to 9.6 percent in January-May from the same period a year earlier, missing market expectations of 10.5 percent, which would have been unchanged from Jan-April.
Fixed investment by private firms continued to slow. Investment by private firms rose 3.9 percent year-on-year in January-May, compared to 5.2 percent growth in the Jan-April.
China's real estate investment rose 7.0 percent in the first five months of 2016 from the same period a year earlier, while property sales by area increased 33.2 percent.
Retail sales growth in May, which captures both private and government purchasing, slowed to 10.0 percent on-year, although the decline was only marginal. Analysts had forecast sales would be unchanged from April at 10.1 percent.
China's May power generation was unchanged from April, with January up 0.9 percent.
Data on May trade and inflation last week also gave investors mixed signals on whether the economy is merely steadying or slowly recovering.
With the economy not yet on firm footing, analysts believe the government and the central bank will have to stick to their stimulative policies and possibly take further measures to ensure momentum does not wane.
Trade data showed a further drop in exports but the smallest decline in imports in more than a year, suggesting domestic demand was picking up as the government goes on an infrastructure spree and housing starts continue to grow.
Price data showed consumer inflation cooled, but production price deflation eased markedly, reducing some of the strains on Chinese companies which are battling shrinking profit margins.
Government pledges to cut excess industrial capacity and restructure bloated state-owned enterprises are a major wild card, posing risks to near-term growth and the financial system. But most economists expect Beijing to move slowly, fearing social instability if millions of people are suddenly thrown out of work.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment at large Japanese manufacturers worsened for the second consecutive quarter over April-June due to a rising yen, although companies did revise up their capital expenditure plans.
Large manufacturers said they expect sentiment to rebound in July-September, offering encouragement to policymakers navigating weak exports and lingering concerns about the global economy.
The survey results could offer some relief to the Bank of Japan, which holds a monetary policy meeting later this weak. The upgrade of capital expenditure plans should bolster the central bank's argument that its negative interest rate policy would spur lending.
""Right now the economy is in a holding pattern, but I don't expect things to worsen from here on,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The benefits of negative rates have been elusive so far, but we could finally be seeing the capital expenditure boost.""
The business survey index (BSI) of sentiment at large manufacturers was minus 11.1 in April-June, compared with minus 7.9 in January-March. The BSI is compiled by the Ministry of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, an arm of the Cabinet Office.
The index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment three months ahead was at plus 7.0 versus plus 7.1 previously.
Companies forecast their capital expenditure to rise 3.8 percent in the business year that started in April, versus a 6.6 percent decline forecast in the previous survey.
Japan's economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter as capital spending fell less than was first reported, but worries remain over slow consumer spending and weak exports.
The yen has gained more than 12 percent versus the dollar since the start of the year on uncertainty over the pace of pending U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increases.
A rising yen tends to worry Japanese companies because it reduces overseas earnings, but the sentiment survey found manufacturers believe the negative impact will be temporary.

The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank cut its main lending rate on Friday for the first time in almost a year, signaling confidence that inflation risks are declining and describing an economic recovery as ""imminent"".
The rate cut comes as Russia's economy, plagued in the past few years by plunging oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, is showing signs that the worst is behind it.
The bank cut the rate by a half-point to 10.5 percent, the first reduction since July 2015, a move predicted by a majority of analysts although some had expected no change.
After declining by 3.7 percent last year, the economy now looks set to begin growing again, helped by an unexpectedly strong rebound in global oil prices and a plunge in inflation that is helping to support living standards.
""After the rise in uncertainty and risks at the start of this year, the situation in the economy is normalizing,"" central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said at a news conference after the decision.
""The dynamics of the economy and inflation are turning out better than we expected.
""We are sure that we will be able to reduce inflation to the target level even in the case that inflation risks are realized,"" she added, referring to the bank's goal of bringing inflation down to 4 percent by the end of 2017.
She cautioned that the rate cut should not necessarily be seen as the start of an easing cycle, saying the timing of any future cuts depended on the economic situation.
In a statement accompanying the rate decision, the bank said it ""will consider the possibility of a further cut based on estimates for inflation risks and alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory"".
The rouble strengthened immediately after the decision, an unusual response as lower interest rates normally make a currency less attractive to hold.
But this factor appeared to be outweighed by the positive signals the central bank had sent about the health of Russia's economy more generally.
""The market has interpreted the decision of the central bank positively,"" said Sergey Romanchuk, head of forex and money markets at Metallinvestbank.
""The central bank is conservative and if even it has decided to lower rates in the current situation, it means its evaluation of the prospects for economic growth and lower inflation are quite reliable.""
IMPROVING PROSPECTS
The rate cut and unusually bullish rhetoric from the central bank testify to the improvement in Russia's economic prospects over recent months as commodity prices rally and geopolitical tensions ease.
Brent crude, an international benchmark for Russia's main export, has recently hit eight-month highs above $50 per barrel, recovering more quickly than expected from a 13-year low of $27 per barrel in January.
Russia remains under Western sanctions, with little expectation they will be lifted in the coming months, but there are indications geopolitical tensions are diminishing.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker will visit an economic summit in St Petersburg next week in a tentative sign European leaders may be keen to rebuild bridges to Russia.
In its statement, the central bank drew attention not only to declining inflation but also to favorable growth trends.
It predicted that quarterly gross domestic product would begin rising in the second half of 2016, with GDP expected to grow by 1.3 percent in 2017.
""Positive trends in the economy are not accompanied by a higher inflationary pressure,"" the bank said, adding that recent macroeconomic indicators ""confirm greater sustainability of the Russian economy to oil price fluctuations"".
There had been growing expectations the bank would cut rates as inflation has fallen sharply over the last year and remained stable at 7.3 percent for the last three months, a better-than-expected outcome.
Inflationary pressure has eased partly because of a rebound in the rouble, helped by the recovery in global oil prices.
The central bank cautioned that although they had declined, risks it would fail to meet its inflation target remained ""at a heightened level"".
It expressed concern about the lack of a mid-term budget consolidation strategy as well as uncertainty about wage and pension indexation, and the risk of further volatility on global commodity markets.

""The materialization of these risks might cause a slowdown in the inflation reduction,"" the central bank said, adding that a further rate cut would hinge on whether inflation continued to fall.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2016 12:59PM ET</span>","U.S. economic outlook brightens on upbeat job, inventory data","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market despite a sharp slowdown in hiring last month.
Other data on Thursday showed wholesale inventories recording their biggest increase in 10 months in April, prompting economists to raise their second-quarter economic growth estimates. The rise in inventories came even as sales at wholesalers rose for a second straight month.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 264,000 for the week ended June 4, the Labor Department said. The drop confounded economists' expectations for an increase to 270,000. 
""The hand-wringing over the May jobs report may be misplaced,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.Â  
Claims have dropped by 30,000 since surging to 294,000 in early May. They have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 66 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,500 to 269,500 last week.
The claims report offered the latest sign that the labor market remains strong even though the economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest gain since September 2010. A report on Wednesday showed job openings hitting a nine-month high in April and layoffs falling to their lowest level since September 2014.
""The underlying trend to a tighter labor market remains intact. It seems clear that the problem with the jobs market is hiring new employees that are suitable for available positions, which in itself is a sign of labor market tightness,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose as a broad decline on commodity and stock markets boosted the appeal of low-risk assets. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell.
ECONOMY REGAINING MOMENTUM
The claims report also showed the number of Americans still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell in the week ending May 28 to the lowest level since October 2000. The insured unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to a record low of 1.5 percent.
The health of the labor market will likely determine the timing of the next Federal Reserve interest rate increase.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen this week reiterated the U.S. central bank's desire to raise rates, but gave no hints on when that might happen.
Before May's dismal jobs report, Yellen had signaled rates would rise ""in coming months"" if economic data continued to suggest that growth was picking up in the second quarter. The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
So far, reports on consumer spending, industrial production and housing suggest the economy has regained speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. 
Growth prospects for the second quarter received a further boost from a separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showing wholesale inventories increasing 0.6 percent in April, the biggest gain since June last year, after rising 0.2 percent in March. 
Sales at wholesalers jumped 1.0 percent in April, the largest increase since April 2015, after advancing 0.6 percent in March. With sales increasing solidly for a second straight month, it would take wholesalers 1.35 months to clear shelves, down from 1.36 months in March. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.8 percent in April. As result, economists raised their second-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as three-tenths of a percentage point to as high as a 2.7 percent rate.
""While the stronger inventory data should boost growth in the first and second quarters relative to what we previously had been expecting, it also should be more of a headwind for growth in the future,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Inventories have been a drag on GDP growth since the third quarter of 2015.

Inflation in the 12 months through May rose to 2.60 percent, the national statistics agency said on Thursday. That compared with a forecast of 2.58 percent in a Reuters poll and April's 2.54 percent annual rate.
After falling to a record low in May 2015, inflation in Latin America's No. 2 economy is posting the longest period on record below the central bank's 3 percent target.
Still, Mexican policymakers unexpectedly raised interest rates in February to support the peso, which has tumbled since late 2014 to record lows during a slump in world oil prices and worries about global growth.
Last month, central bank Governor Agustin Carstens suggested policymakers would be reluctant to make another unexpected move even after the peso fell by the most in May in four years.
Taking pressure off the central bank, the peso <MXN=> has bounced back in June, after weak jobs data in the United States dampened expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise borrowing costs this month.
The new data showed consumer prices fell 0.45 percent in May, in line with estimates in the Reuters poll and the second consecutive monthly drop, on summer electricity cost subsidies and lower tomato prices.
The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.21 percent during the month <MXCPIX=ECI>, just below the 0.22 percent estimate seen in the poll.
The 12-month core inflation rate rose to 2.93 percent, its highest since December 2014, from 2.83 percent in April. The figure was in line with forecasts.

The reading in May was -0.2 percent, easing from -0.4 percent in April. Consumer prices were led lower by housing costs, durable goods and transport costs.
The data also showed the headline consumer price index fell 0.9 percent year-on-year, with the annual pace of deflation easing from -1.3 percent in April.
For years an inflation outlier in the euro zone, Greece has been in deflation mode since March 2013 based on its headline index, as wage and pension cuts and a protracted recession took a heavy toll on Greek household income.
Deflation in Greece, which signed up to its first international bailout in 2010, hit its highest level in November 2013, when consumer prices registered a 2.9 percent year-on-year decline.

The euro zone remained in deflation for a second straight month in May, although prices fell by less than in April principally due to a slowdown in the decline of energy prices, according to a first estimate from the EU's statistics agency.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreaâs central bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates to a record low 1.25 percent on Thursday, to cushion the economy against weak exports and the fallout from a massive restructuring of an ailing shipping industry.
The 25 basis points reduction was the first cut since the Bank of Korea (BOK) last lowered rates in June 2015.
Though low inflation is a source of concern, and a reason for lowering interest rates, some economists doubted whether the central bank could afford to cut again once an anticipated increase in U.S. interest rates finally takes place.
Just four of 23 analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the central bank would lower the rate, although most of those who saw a June hold forecast that rates would be cut in July.
The decision to cut rates was unanimous, Governor Lee Ju-yeol told a news conference.
""The problem is in the second half of the year, when we see downside risks increasing,"" said Lee. ""We feel the sluggishness in global trade is worse than we expected. And there will also be downside risks once corporate restructuring begins in earnest.""
The move came just a day after the International Monetary Fund said South Korea needed to speedily implement additional fiscal stimulus and ease monetary policy to offset risks posed by ""weak and volatile external demand"".
A tumble in trade since January last year has darkened the outlook for South Korea's export-driven economy - Asia's fourth-largest - while persistently weak inflation opens the door to yet lower rates.
The finance ministry will be releasing their policy plans for the second half of the year later in June. The ministry usually announces revised economic forecasts at this time and some analysts believe a supplementary budget will also be on the agenda.
On Wednesday, the government and central bank said an 11 trillion won ($9.50 billion) fund would be created to support two state-run banks most exposed to the once-thriving shipping and shipbuilding sectors. 
By the time the proposed restructuring is complete in 2018, major shipbuilders' capacity will likely have fallen 20 percent, and their workforce by 30 percent.
""We continue to watch the interplay between progress on corporate restructuring, the likely impact this will have on domestic demand, and how other policy branches of government respond to this,"" ANZ said in a note.
""Monetary easing alone is not sufficient to absorb the burden corporate restructuring places on the South Korean economy.""
At Thursday's news conference Governor Lee insisted the bank had fully signalled the rate cut at its previous meeting, noting the bank's decisions did not hinge on the policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise rates at least once this year.
Many analysts saw June or July as the last chance for the BOK to cut rates as the Fed rate hike looms closer.
""Many expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates in June or July but after the May jobs data a June hike now seems impossible. The BOK probably thought taking action before the Fed's rate hike would be safer,"" said Lee Sur-bee, a fixed-income analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities.
The analyst said Thursday's move would be the last cut this year, a view shared by many other economists contacted by Reuters. The BOK chief added interest rates at home should remain higher than those of advanced economies.
Bond futures erased some gains after the BOK news conference, but were still up 0.07 points, trading at 110.63. The won was flat against the dollar as of 0418 GMT after collapsing briefly following the rate cut.
Addressing the problem of South Korea's high household debt, the BOK chief said borrowing would likely slow, despite lower interest rates, because banks are screening borrowers more closely. 
Inflation would likely approach the bank's 2 percent target in 2017, he said.
The BOK is expected to trim its GDP growth forecast of 2.8 percent for this year at a quarterly review in July.
The IMF lowered its 2016 GDP forecast for South Korea to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent in April while earlier this month the OECD slashed its projection from 3.1 percent to 2.7 percent.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2016 03:20AM ET</span>",German trade surplus hits fresh monthly record in April,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German imports unexpectedly fell in April while exports were unchanged, propelling the trade surplus of Europe's biggest economy to a fresh monthly record despite weaker demand from emerging markets such as China.
The overall solid trade data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Thursday, are likely to stir up a debate about how Germany's relatively strong exports are continuing to fuel global economic imbalances.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have for years urged Germany to step up public and private investment in infrastructure to reduce its current account surplus.
Close allies such as France and the United States have also called for Germany to boost domestic demand, and Berlin has reacted to this by increasing its spending on infrastructure and accommodating and integrating a record influx of refugees.
Analysts said the data suggested that Germany's economic growth pace would slow in the second quarter, pointing out that the trade surplus widened in April because of weaker imports.
""The times of Germany's export boom are over for the time being,"" VP bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said, adding weaker global demand was the main reason behind the subdued trade prospects.
""Important trading partners such as China, Russia and Brazil haven't overcome their crisis yet,"" DIHK economist Volker Treier said, adding that trade with the Unites States - Germany's most important trading partner - also slowed due to a stronger euro.
The data showed that seasonally adjusted imports edged down 0.2 percent in April on the month while exports were unchanged after rising two consecutive months.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 0.6 percent and imports to rise by 1.2 percent.
The fall in imports widened the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 24.0 billion euros from revised 23.7 billion euros in March which had been the highest monthly value so far.
A breakdown of non-adjusted trade data showed exports to European Union countries soared while demand from countries outside the bloc edged down.
ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the trade data were evidence that the German economy was struggling to gain further momentum after its surprisingly strong start to the year.
The German economy grew by 0.7 percent in the first quarter, its strongest quarterly growth rate in two years, helped by higher private consumption and construction investment. But economists expect the pace to slow in the second quarter.
Data released earlier this week showed industrial output rose slightly more than expected in April while weaker foreign demand drove a bigger-than-expected drop in industrial orders.

Consumer inflation rose less than forecast as pressure from high food prices eased, while producer prices recovered more than forecast, the statistics bureau said on Thursday.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.0 percent year-on-year in May, compared with a 2.3 percent increase in April. Food prices were up 5.9 percent year-on-year in May after rising 7.4 percent in April.
Prices of China's staple meat pork rose 33.6 percent last month and hit record levels last week.
Non-food prices rose 1.1 percent, flat from April and continuing to show a lack of price pressures that would indicate activity in the broader economy was gaining steam.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected consumer inflation to come in at 2.3 percent, the same pace as in each of the previous three months.
""On a month-on-month basis, China's CPI has been dropping for three consecutive months, clearly pointing to an easing bias in monetary policy for the time being,"" said Zhou Hao, senior Asia emerging market economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
Improvements in producer prices will not change China's overall soft inflation outlook, Hao added.
In a sign that strains on Chinese companies are easing, producer prices fell at their slowest rate since November 2014, supported by a government investment spree and higher commodity prices.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.8 percent in May, up from a 3.4 percent drop in April. On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.5 percent, the third increase in a row.
Analysts had expected PPI to fall 3.3 percent, extending a more-than-four-year decline which has eroded profit margins.
China's consumer inflation rate remains well below the official 3 percent target, and despite strengthening producer prices analysts do not see inflation at these levels impacting policy decisions.
""At these levels, inflation dynamics are not an important factor in this year's monetary policy decisions,"" said Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Zhu says May and June economic data will continue to show a recovery, but expected growth will slow again in the second half, which should lead to further support from the government.
""We still see one interest rate cut this year. It's a close call, but we see that it is still likely to happen. We moved the timing to the fourth quarter when we see the growth dynamics slowing down.""
Many economists have scaled back expectations of further cuts in interest rates and bank reserve ratios this year as the PBOC has shown a preference for more targeted cash injections to help badly stressed sectors such as farming and small companies.
The government also seems to be putting a greater emphasis on fiscal spending to support growth, amid worries of the dangers of relying on too much debt-fuelled stimulus.

Data released on Wednesday showed China's exports in May weakened, but imports were stronger than expected, pointing to improving domestic demand and adding to hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be slowly stabilising.

China attributed the drop in consumer inflation to falling vegetable prices, which only rose 6.4% year-on-year in May, down sharply from a 22.6% increase in April.
The PBOC in its mid-year economic forecasts released Wednesday revised up its 2016 CPI growth forecast to 2.4% from previous projection of 1.7%.
The government set the CPI growth target at about 3.0% for 2016, which serves as the ceiling for Premier Li Keqiang's reasonable range for the economy.

""The underlying trend in inflation has continued to improve,"" he told business leaders in northern Japan, adding that ""this doesn't preclude additional monetary easing if necessary.""
""The output gap is expected to move into positive territory and gradually increase further from the second half of fiscal 2016.""
""Thus, upward pressure on wages and prices due to the tightening of supply and demand conditions is likely to steadily increase,"" he said.

As well, the Consumer Confidence Survey showed the public's inflation expectations fell sharply in May, the first drop in three months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders tumbled in April by the most in two years, partly due to earthquakes in a southern manufacturing hub but raising the risk that business investment will remain weak for most of the year.
The 11.0 percent month-on-month fall in core orders was much deeper than the median estimate for a 2.3 percent decline in a Reuters poll of analysts.
It also marked the biggest decline since May 2014. In March, core orders rose 5.5 percent.
Any further delays in capital expenditure raise pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, which will announce more economic stimulus measures this autumn in an attempt to recharge a largely disappointing economic campaign.
""This is a result of the Kumamoto earthquakes, but China's economic slowdown is also having a negative impact,"" said Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities.
""Capex fell in the first quarter. The second quarter looks weak and this could extend into the third quarter. This will affect the size of government stimulus and monetary easing.""
On April 14 the first of several strong earthquakes struck Kumamoto Prefecture in southern Japan, damaging houses, causing landslides and halting production at electronics and car parts factories.
Many companies were able to quickly resume production, but the April machinery orders data suggests the damage to business investment was deeper than expected, Aoki at UBS said.
Compared to the previous month, orders from manufacturers fell 13.3 percent, while orders from the services sector fell 3.9 percent, the data showed.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, fell 8.2 percent in April, more than a median estimate for a 2.3 percent annual fall. Policymakers were counting on an increase in capital expenditure to fuel gains in productivity, create new jobs and increase wages, but hopes have gradually faded as data has shown that corporate profit growth has peaked.
""Earnings have been falling from last year, which is leading companies to but the breaks on their investment plans,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""If the government's stimulus policies contribute to improving the economic outlook, this could get companies investing again.""
Since taking office in late 2012, Abe's government has offered tax breaks to encourage capital expenditure and lobbied Japanese companies directly to boost spending.
Japanese companies investment needs are high because the country's capital stock is ageing. Funding costs are also low due to ultra-easy monetary policy.

Still, it has been difficult to maintain capital expenditure gains due to worries about a rising yen and a shrinking domestic market, economists say.

The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showing consumption, including healthcare spending, increased at a faster clip than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month.
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the QSS data suggested first-quarter consumer spending could be raised as much as two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.1 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third GDP estimate on June 28.
JPMorgan also estimated that growth in spending on intellectual products, a wide variety of services ranging from entertainment to scientific research and development, could be revised up to a 1.5 percent rate from a pace of -0.1 percent.
That, together with data last week on international trade and construction spending, suggest first-quarter gross domestic product could be raised to as high as a 1.2 percent rate from the 0.8 percent pace the government reported last month.
""The upward revision to services consumption also has favorable forward-looking implications for second quarter GDP growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - British industrial output grew at the fastest pace in nearly four years in April, though economists said the surprise surge did not look like a return to stronger economic growth before the country's EU referendum.
Industrial output rose 2.0 percent in April after a 0.3 percent rise in March, the biggest month-on-month increase since July 2012, official data showed. That was far stronger than even the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Bank of England policymakers are likely to take the data with a pinch of salt, having warned that economic figures are likely to be volatile and tricky to interpret before the June 23 referendum on Britain's European Union membership.
A recent overall slowdown in the economy is largely due to uncertainty about the outcome of the vote, according to the overwhelming majority of analysts in a Reuters poll published on Tuesday. [ECILT/GB]
Organisations ranging from the BoE to the International Monetary Fund have warned of a shock to the economy if British voters opt to leave the EU.
The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output also rose at the fastest pace since July 2012, up 2.3 percent on the month following a 0.1 percent increase in March.
""Despite the upbeat tone of the ... figures, it is far too soon to proclaim that the sector is out of the woods, or shrugging off Brexit uncertainty,"" said Paul Hollingsworth, economist at Capital Economics.
The data, which sent sterling to a session high, were boosted by the biggest monthly rise in the often volatile pharmaceuticals sector since February 2014, as well as a surge in electricity and gas production in an unusually cold April.
Economists were doubtful that the figures heralded a return to solid growth.
""Our central expectation is that April's spike corrects in May with a sharp fall, which would still mean that for Q2 as a whole, manufacturing production growth is slightly negative,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) economist Dominic Bryant said.
Manufacturing association EEF said the figures were in line with its view that the sector - which failed to contribute to economic growth in 2015 - is slowly turning a corner. 
Manufacturing represents around 10 percent of British economic output and the sector remains 6.4 percent below its pre-crisis peak.
Looking at the three months to April, which gives a better sense of the underlying trend in what is often volatile data, industrial output rose 0.7 percent, the first increase this year.
Britain's overall economy slowed in the first quarter, with the pace of growth easing to 0.4 percent compared with 0.6 percent in the previous three months.
Things could get worse in the current quarter. A series of surveys of businesses from Markit/CIPS published last week suggested growth was on course to slow to just 0.2 percent in the April-June period.

They also suggested some companies have put contracts on hold ahead of the referendum.

After returning to power in late 2012, Abe embarked on a three-pronged strategy - dubbed ""Abenomics"" - of massive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms to break the economy free of years of deflation, but it continues to flit in and out of recession.
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - dubbed ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence dipped 0.5 point to 43.0 from the previous month.
It was the lowest index reading since November 2014, the data, released by the Cabinet Office showed on Wednesday, showed.
One of the biggest reasons for the poorer sentiment was weakness in the housing market, suggesting the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy may be distorting some areas of the economy and failing in its mission to raise inflation expectations.
""As a consequence of the negative rate policy, the number of people buying income-generating properties is increasing and land prices are rising, which makes it seem that the real-estate industry is doing well. But the actual economy is not good. Rent isn't rising and the proportion of rooms that are empty remains high - I cannot say the economy is looking up,"" said a respondent from the real-estate industry.
Sentiment also worsened due to concerns that shoppers' frustration with low wage growth is forcing them to focus spending on bargains.
""Consumers are shopping at stores that offer products that are as cheap as possible, which shows deflationary trends are strong. Consumer mindset remains low and will worsen somewhat in the future,"" said a respondent from the convenience store industry.
Weak service-sector sentiment is bad news for the BOJ, which has struggled to lift inflation despite its controversial decision in January to lower interest rates into negative territory.
The data also raises the pressure on Abe's government before upper house elections next month and the announcement of an economic stimulus package this autumn.
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, rose 1.8 points to 47.3 in May, helped by expectations that conditions will improve as recovery from the earthquakes that devastated southern Japan in April continues, and that households will spend more to cope with a hot summer.

Exports fell 4.1 percent from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs reported, saying the foreign trade environment remains a challenge.
Imports dropped 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the smallest decline since they turned negative in November 2014, likely reflecting higher commodities prices but also suggesting that domestic demand has picked up as Beijing increases spending on big infrastructure projects to support growth.
That resulted in a trade surplus of $49.98 billion in May, versus forecasts of $58 billion and April's $45.6 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected May exports to fall 3.6 percent, after a 1.8 percent decline in April, and expected imports to fall 6 percent, following April's 10.9 percent decline.
China's official manufacturing activity survey last week showed signs of steadying in May but remained weak amid soft demand at home and abroad, with new orders expanding more slowly and growth in export orders stalling.
The trade data is the first to be released by China for May.
March indicators were upbeat, sparking hopes that the economy was perking up, but April was less rosy, raising concerns that the spring bounce may be short-lived.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter as capital spending fell less than was first reported, but worries remain over slow consumer spending and weak exports.
""The upward revision is very slight, and when you exclude the impact of leap year growth is not that strong,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""We expect growth to slow in the current quarter. The government should focus on steps to help low-income earners, but consumption may not rise much if consumer sentiment worsens.""
Further gains in the yen could lower export profits and discourage companies from increasing investment and wages.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will announce additional economic measures this autumn, but economists worry his piecemeal approach to policy means that not enough money will be allocated to reversing population decline and speeding up growth.
Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 1.9 percent rate in the first quarter of this year, revised up from a preliminary reading of 1.7 percent growth, the Cabinet Office data showed.
The revised January-March GDP matched the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists.
Compared to the previous quarter, GDP rose 0.5 percent, which was more than the preliminary reading of 0.4 percent growth and the same as the median estimate.
Excluding the impact of leap year, which added an extra day to February, GDP probably expanded around 0.2 percent, Tonouchi said.
Capital expenditure, a major component of GDP, fell 0.7 percent, less than a preliminary decline of 1.4 percent. That compared with the median estimate for a 0.3 percent decline.
Private consumption rose 0.6 percent, slightly above the preliminary 0.5 percent increase recorded.
Abe announced last week a widely expected two-and-a-half year delay in hiking sales tax because of weak consumer spending, although economists worry that postponement signals the government is losing control of fiscal discipline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. nonfarm productivity fell less sharply than initially thought in the first quarter and labor-related costs surged for a second straight quarter as companies hired more workers to raise output, suggesting profits could remain under pressure.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, contracted at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent, instead of the 1.0 percent pace the government reported last month. 
Productivity fell at a 1.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The revision for the first quarter, which reflected modestly higher output than previously estimated, was in line with economists' expectations.
""Despite subdued wage growth, low productivity growth means that companies still face significant labor costs for producing an extra unit of output,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Fast-rising unit labor costs have been associated with weak profits for companies in recent years.""
Corporate profits have been soft, also hurt by a strong dollar, which has undercut demand for U.S.-manufactured goods and overseas earnings of multinational firms. After-tax corporate profits fell 5.1 percent in 2015 and rose at only a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the productivity report.
Output per worker in the first quarter was revised to show a 0.9 percent rate of increase, up from 0.4 percent. The government last month raised its first-quarter economic growth estimate to a 0.8 percent rate from the 0.5 percent pace reported in April.
LOW GROWTH POTENTIAL 
Productivity has only increased in two of the last six quarters. It rose at a 0.7 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
The weakness in productivity partially explains the divergence between the economy's anemic performance at the start of the year and a fairly strong labor market, marked by average monthly job gains of 196,000 in the first quarter.
Some economists have attributed the weak productivity to the changing industry mix, which has seen a shift from manufacturing and energy toward the production of services. Productivity increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0percent in each of the last five years, suggesting the economy's potential rate of growth has declined.
That would imply the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflation pressures may take hold a bit faster than had been anticipated.
""The slower pace of productivity gains in recent years suggests the economy's potential rate of growth has fallen,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Even with economic growth of around only 2 percent for the remainder of the year, inflation is likely to rise if corporations aim to maintain margins."" 
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a revised 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter. They were previously reported to have advanced at a 4.1 percent rate. 
Fourth-quarter unit labor costs were revised to show a 5.4 percent rate of increase, the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 2014, instead of 2.7 percent. Unit labor costs rose at a 3.0 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2015. 

Hourly compensation per hour increased at an upwardly revised 3.9 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 3.0 percent pace.

In a second revision of its figures, Eurostat said that gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.6 percent from the previous quarter and by 1.7 percent year-on-year.
That compared with its initial ""preliminary flash"" figures of 0.6 and 1.6 percent on April 29 and subsequent downward cut in its flash estimate to 0.5 and 1.5 percent on May 5.
The rate of growth matched the level in the first quarter of 2015, a pace only surpassed at the start of 2011, when the euro zone economy raced ahead at 0.9 percent.
The greatest contributions to overall euro zone GDP were household spending and private sector investment. Inventory changes and public sector spending were also positive, but imports increased by more than exports.
Quarter-on-quarter growth was at a healthy 0.7 percent in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, 0.6 percent in France and 0.3 percent in Italy.

The only euro zone nation suffering contraction was Greece, whose economy shrank by 0.5 percent. There were no figures provided for Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2016-16Date7 June 2016
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate moderated further in the first part of the year, though recent actions by Chinese policymakers are supporting the near-term outlook.
Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
In financial markets, conditions have generally been calmer for the past several months following the period of volatility early in the year. Attention is now turning to some particular event risks. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, recent data suggest overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators have been more mixed of late, but are consistent with continued expansion of employment in the near term.
Inflation has been quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate overall is helping the traded sector. Over the past year, growth in credit to businesses has picked up, even as that to households has moderated a little. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
Indications are that the effects of supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Dwelling prices have begun to rise again recently. But considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May meeting, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and inflation returning to target over time.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is considering offering incentives to increase response rates to a revised consumer spending survey, the agency's commissioner told Reuters on Monday.
Such incentives are usually financial - paying people to respond - but they could, for example, also include an Apple (O:AAPL) iPad for respondents that they can keep after using it to report information, she said.
""There have been tests with incentives and we may go that direction,"" said BLS chief Erica Groshen.
Data collected on expenditures is used to support revisions to the Consumer Price Index and other forms of economic research. Survey questions run the gamut from spending on housing, furniture, and vehicles to outlays for insurance, medical care and vacations.
Response rates to the surveys the BLS uses to obtain data from households fell to 76 percent in 2004 from 86 percent in 1990, according to a BLS study.
In 2009, the BLS launched its Gemini Project to research ways it could improve the survey. It is scheduled to finish examining the use of incentives in 2017, according to project documents, with a large scale feasibility test for an overall revamp to be completed in 2019.
The BLS uses cash incentives with its American Time Use Survey but only for households without a telephone or with a non-working number. They are mailed a $40 debit card that can be activated with a code provided only after they complete an interview.
The money entices people to participate and reimburses them for the telephone call, according to survey documents.
Separately on Monday, Groshen cautioned against reading too much into a single piece of information after Friday's surprisingly low U.S. job growth data dampened expectations that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates at its meeting on June 14 and 15.
""To think that one number is going to tell you the entire state of the labor market is asking a lot of one number,"" she told Reuters during a conference hosted by the BLS, and agency of the Department of Labor.
The U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, the data showed on Friday, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday said interest rate increases are coming but gave little sense of when.

The central bank's labor market conditions index, which has declined for seven straight months, fell to -4.8 in May from -3.4 in April. The April figure was initially reported at -0.9.
Last Friday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 38,000 workers in May, the fewest since September 2010. The increase fell far short of the 164,000 forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The smaller-than-expected rise in nonfarm payrolls resulted in traders scaling back their expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates soon.
U.S. interest rates futures implied traders saw a 6 percent chance the central bank would raise interest rates at its policy next week , up slightly from 4 percent on Friday, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch program.

Traders expected the Fed would consider November as the earliest it would hike rates.

""The new car market in May remained high ... but the low growth is further evidence of the market cooling in the face of concerns around economic and political stability,"" SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said.

Britain's economy has slowed ahead of the June 23 referendum on the country's EU membership.

A Reuters poll of 15 economists produced a median forecast of 1.4 percent annual inflation for May, well inside the central bank's projection of 1.1-1.9 percent for the month.
Inflation has stayed below the central bank's 2-4 percent target for a year on the back of low fuel prices and imports of the national staple rice, allowing policymakers to stand pat on rates since October 2014.

The Melbourne Institute monthly inflation gauge fell 0.2 percent in May, from April when it rose 0.1 percent.
That slowed the annual inflation rate to 1.0 percent, from 1.5 percent, driving it further below the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2 percent to 3 percent target band.
The trimmed mean measure also dipped 0.2 percent, reversing a 0.2 percent rise in April. In the twelve months to May, the trimmed mean increased by 1.0 percent, down from 1.5 percent.
""This month, the result was driven by falls in fruit and vegetable prices, as well as falls in non-durables and international holiday travel,"" said Sam Tsiaplias, senior research fellow at the Melbourne Institute.
""Looking at either the headline or trimmed mean measures, annual inflation appears to have fallen to about 1 percent. Inflation excluding volatile items has also fallen to 1.5 per cent in annual terms. Whichever measure happens to be preferred, it is fairly clear that there is a sizeable gap between target and actual inflation.""

Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), tracking activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 54.5 from 53.6 in April.
The reading was below a flash estimate of 54.7, but still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the results were ""good but not spectacular"". Survey data for the second quarter so far indicated gross domestic product would grow as much as 0.5 percent in the April-June period, he said.
The German economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter, more than doubling its growth rate and cementing its role as the euro zone's growth engine. Soaring private consumption and a construction boom more than offset a dip in foreign trade.
The government expects GDP to expand by 1.7 percent this year, on a par with last year.
The PMI sub-index for services rose to a three-month high of 55.2 in May from 54.5 in April. Services providers continued to hire staff, making the rate of job creation the strongest so far this year.
""It seems as if the German employment machine keeps humming,"" Kolodseike said. However, the data also gave a few reasons for caution, he said.
New business increased at the slowest pace in 10 months and work outstanding dropped the most in 12 months, he noted.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap rose 5.3 percent to $37.4 billion. March's trade deficit was revised down to $35.5 billion, which was the smallest since December 2013, from the previously reported $40.4 billion.
The government revised trade data going back to 2013.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit rising to $41.3 billion in April.
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $57.6 billion from $56.1 billion in March.
The trade deficit for April was smaller than the monthly average for the first quarter, suggesting trade will probably contribute to gross domestic product in the April-June period.
Trade has been a drag on GDP growth over the last three quarters.
In April, exports of goods increased 2.5 percent to $120.1 billion. Exports have been undercut by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand. With the dollar's rally ebbing and U.S.-made goods becoming more competitive on international markets, some of the weight on exports is starting to lift.
Overall exports of goods and services rose 1.5 percent to $182.8 billion in April. Exports to the European Union fell 6.0 percent, while goods shipped to Canada increased 1.1 percent. Exports to China fell 3.2 percent.
Imports of goods rose 2.4 percent to $178.9 billion in April, pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand. Part of the increase reflected a rise in oil prices. Oil prices averaged $29.48 per barrel in April, up from $27.68 in March. The petroleum trade deficit was the smallest since February 1999.
Imports from China surged 10.5 percent. With exports falling, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit increased 16.3 percent to $24.3 billion in April.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS Services Purchasing Managers Index rose to 53.5 last month from a reading of 52.3 in April.
Analysts had expected the index to rise to 52.5 in April.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Despite the better than expected read, Markit warned that the improvement in expectations would hinge on the June 23 referendum on the U.K.âs membership in the European Union (EU).
The research group also highlighted that it was the slowest gain in new business in the 41-month growth sequence and that hiring was at a 33-month low.
""The PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as âBrexitâ worries exacerbated existing headwinds,"" Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
""The data so far indicate that the second quarter is likely to see the economy grow by just 0.2%,"" he forecast.
The pound was little changed after the data. GBP/USD was trading at 1.4429 from around 1.4432 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7730 from 0.7727 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded higher, with Londonâs FTSE 100 gaining 0.93%. The EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.18%, France's CAC 40 traded up 0.28%, while Germany's DAX advanced 0.40%."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to grow faster than initially estimated in the first quarter as capital spending fell less than expected, a Reuters poll found, but even a GDP revision is unlikely to change the impression of a lethargic economy. 
The economy is expected to have expanded an annualized 1.9 percent in January-March, the poll of 23 analysts showed, after 1.7 percent growth shown in the preliminary data.
That would be 0.5 percent growth from the previous quarter, revised up from 0.4 percent initially announced, the poll showed.
""An appreciation of the yen could rein in manufacturers' capital spending going forward,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
""If the rate of economic growth is revised up - led by capital spending - it would be taken as a positive factor. But we cannot expect capital spending will lead economic growth."" 
The poll found that capital expenditure, a major component of gross domestic product, was thought likely to fall 0.3 percent over the quarter - substantially more robust than the 1.4 percent decline seen in the preliminary reading.
The Cabinet Office will publish the revised first quarter GDP data at 8:50 a.m on June 8 (2350 GMT June 7).
The poll found core machinery orders, regarded as a useful though volatile leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 3.8 percent in April from the previous month.
From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude orders for ships and electrical equipment, were seen to have declined 2.3 percent in April after a 3.2 percent gain in March.
""There is still uncertainty over the outlook for capex due to factors such as the yen's relatively firm trend, a slowdown in emerging economies, and sluggish domestic demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""On the other hand, the environment for capex, such as demand for renewing or upgrading old facilities, demand ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and lower interest rates, has not worsened."" 
The Cabinet Office will release machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. on June 9.
The current account balance, which will be announced at the same time as GDP, was seen likely to show a surplus of 2.32 trillion yen ($21.34 billion) in April, the poll showed.
It would be the 22nd straight month of surplus helped by a positive trade balance and income from overseas investments.
The poll showed the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for goods and services, was expected to show an annual decline of about 4.2 percent in May.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Wednesday, as widely expected, he would delay a planned sales tax hike by two-and-a-half years to forestall risks from external factors - notably slowing Chinese growth.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in May from 49.3 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The index returned above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction and showed activity expanded at the fastest since February, though the rate of change signaled only a mild improvement in business conditions.
The index for new business rose to 50.4 from 50.2 in the previous month.
The composite index for output in both manufacturing and services rose to 49.2 in May from 48.9 in the previous month, but remained in contractionary territory for a third month.
In 2014, services accounted for 65 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, while manufacturing had a 21 percent share.
Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter, thanks in part to a leap year consumption boost, but analysts say the rebound is not strong enough to dispel concerns over a contraction this quarter.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Wednesday his widely expected decision to delay a scheduled April sales tax increase by two-and-a-half years, putting his plans for fiscal reforms on the back burner due to growing signs of weakness in the economy.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for May dropped to 51.2 from 51.8 in April. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion on a monthly basis, while readings below signal contraction.
New business rose only modestly in May and at a slower pace than both April and the series' historical average.
In response, services firms hired fewer workers. The employment sub-component fell to 50.6 from April's 50.9, Business expectations, meanwhile, fell to a five-month low, but remained most respondents remained optimistic.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as it shifts the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.
A sustained slowdown in the sector would present a challenge to the government's growth targets, especially as it steps up efforts to shut down excess capacity in the industrial sector that could throw millions of people out of work. 
""The government needs to continue to push forward stabilizing measures to help the economy recover,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note before the survey was released.
""It should also relax the control and regulation of the services sector to enable it to realize its growth potential and facilitate the transformation of the economy.""
Taken together, growth in both China's manufacturing and services sectors also slowed in May, but still expanded at a modest pace. The composite PMI fell to a three-month low of 50.5 from 50.8 in April. 
The composite employment figure remain unchanged at 48.3 in May, marking the 12th straight month of job losses.
China's official services survey earlier this week also showed activity continued to expand but at a slower pace, with the headline reading dipping to 53.1 from 53.5 in April. Its employment gauge fell in May and has been in contraction for at least 12 months. 
China's official factory survey and Caixin's private survey for May gave somewhat mixed signals on the health of manufacturing, but both suggested conditions remain weak.

The official survey showed activity expanded for the third month in a row in May, albeit only marginally, while the Caixin manufacturing PMI declined from the previous month and was in negative territory for the 15th month in a row.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers increased hiring in May and new applications for jobless benefits fell last week, further boosting the economic outlook for the second quarter.
Another report on Thursday showed planned layoffs by U.S.-based employers fell 53 percent to a five-month low last month.
The steady stream of upbeat data suggest the economy is regaining momentum after growth slowed sharply at the start of the year, which could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month or in July.
""Labor market conditions are stable, which is all the reassurance the Fed will need to act soon,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased 173,000 last month on top of the 166,000 jobs added in April. Gains in private employment were nearly broad-based last month, though manufacturing lost 3,000 jobs. 
The construction industry added 13,000 jobs and services industry employment increased by 175,000 jobs. 
The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the release on Friday of the government's more comprehensive employment report for May.
The ADP report did not appear to be affected by a month-long strike by Verizon (N:VZ) workers, which is expected to have sliced 35,100 jobs from nonfarm payrolls in May. 
The striking workers, who returned to their jobs on Wednesday, were regarded as unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week. 
According to a Reuters survey, employment likely increased by 162,000 jobs last month after rising by 160,000 in April. The unemployment rate is forecast slipping to 4.9 percent in May from 5 percent in April. 
""With the Verizon strike settled, job growth will bounce back in June,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Job growth continues to run above the level needed to keep up with normal growth in the labor force, absorbing the job market slack remaining from the recession.""
The economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with population growth.
The Fed has signaled its intention to raise rates again soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in economic growth in the second quarter. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months"" if those conditions are met.
So far, data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering momentum after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Thursday's data, with traders focused on global events, including the European Central Bank's minor upward adjustments to its inflation projections, lower oil prices and concerns about Britain's future in the European Union. 
The dollar (DXY) was flat against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks fell.
JOB MARKET TIGHTENING
A second report from the Labor Department also struck an optimistic note on the job market. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended May 28, the department said. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 65 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a bettermeasure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-weekvolatility, fell 1,750 to 276,750 last week. 
The slightly elevated four-week average continues to reflect a spike in applications early in May, which economists blamed on the Verizon labor dispute and different timings for school spring breaks, which often make it difficult to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations.
In a third report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 53 percent to 30,157 in May. That was the smallest number since December.
Layoffs continued in the energy sector, with companies announcing another 7,572 job cuts. The number was, however, 60 percent lower than in April. Energy firms have announced 75,232 job cuts so far this year, up 25 percent from the same period in 2015. 

""Oil prices have improved somewhat since the beginning of the year ... the recent gains may be enough to at least temporarily slow job cuts in the sector,"" said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Excluding the 1.1 percent fall in energy, producer prices were up 0.1 percent in April, compared to a 0.1 percent decline in March.
This positive reading was due to slightly higher prices for intermediate, capital and durable goods, with non-durable goods prices falling.
Energy prices fell 1.1 percent after a 1.1 percent increase in March. On an annual basis, energy prices were 12.5 percent lower.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 05:30AM ET</span>",Summer hiring in Spain may give Rajoy pre-election boost,"By Sarah White
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain has posted its biggest fall in unemployment ever recorded in May as resorts hired staff ahead of a record influx of tourists, a potential boost for acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in an election re-run in three weeks.
Unemployment has been gradually receding in Spain since a recession ended nearly three years ago, but many jobseekers are still struggling to find work, fuelling frustrations among voters.
Spain returns to the ballot box on June 26 after an inconclusive December election stripped Rajoy's centre-right People's Party (PP) of its absolute majority. Opinions polls show the vote could produce another political stalemate, forcing parties to once again try and form a coalition.
The number of Spaniards registering as unemployed last month fell by 3 percent from April, dipping below the 4 million threshold for the first time in six years to 3.89 million, data from the Labour Ministry showed on Thursday.
Nearly 120,000 fewer people signed on as jobless, the biggest drop for a month of May on record. Job creation, meanwhile, progressed at a slightly slower pace than a year ago but was still strong, growing by over 1 percent from an already solid April. One in six jobs was in hotels and restaurants.
Spain's dysfunctional labor market played a major role in December's political upset, as support for upstart parties advocating stronger workers' rights or an overhaul of job contracts fragmented the vote.
According to voters polled so far, the PP will still come in first place but well shy of a parliamentary majority.
Surveys showed that a quarter of voters made up their minds in the very last days of December's campaign, meaning the undecided could still be swayed at the last minute.
""If the campaign is important, then these (job) numbers are important, especially for the PP as it's the only issue they can campaign on,"" said Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso.
Anti-austerity party Podemos (""We Can""), now teaming up with a smaller left-wing force, is expected to place second or third thanks to strong backing from millions of Spaniards who have yet to benefit by the economic recovery.
Mass layoffs during a six year downturn left Spain with the second-highest unemployment rate in Europe. Though it has fallen sharply since 2013 it still stands at 21 percent of the workforce, according to a National Statistics Institute (INE) survey.

Financial data company Markit said its monthly survey of construction purchasing managers showed the weakest overall growth in activity growth since June 2013, with its headline construction PMI dropping to 51.2 from April's 52.0.
Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to hold steady at 52.0 in May.
The new orders component fell especially sharply, dropping to 48.1 from 50.1, its first time since April 2013 below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction and the lowest index reading since March 2013.
""Survey respondents noted that the forthcoming EU referendum has disrupted new order flows and the timing of client decision-making in particular,"" Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Last month, the Bank of England said commercial property transactions had ground to a halt in the run-up to June's EU vote. Official figures for the first quarter of 2016 showed the first year-on-year drop in business investment in three years, led by weaker spending on offices and non-residential buildings.
Markit said civil engineering projects showed the least activity, followed by housebuilding and commercial work.
However, companies stepped up hiring, increasing staff numbers at the fastest rate since January, and Moore said there was the biggest divergence between orders and staffing trends since the survey began in 1997.
""An optimistic interpretation is that construction firms are looking through the second-quarter weakness and feel that workloads will recover momentum,"" he said.
""However, should this fail to materialize later in 2016, then job creation is likely to come under pressure given its elevated trend relative to current demand patterns,"" he added.
Construction makes up 6 percent of Britain's economy, though it accounts for a disproportionate amount of volatility in official gross domestic product data.

Tuesday's manufacturing PMI showed an unexpected return to modest growth. Friday's private-sector services PMI will give stronger direction on second-quarter growth.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.2 from Aprilâs reading of 52.0.
Economists had expected the index to remain at 52.0 in May.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit senior economist Tim Moore noted that May signaled the worst month for commercial building since June 2013 and indicated that survey respondents said the June 23 referendum on the U.K.âs membership in the European Union had disrupted new order flows and the timing of client decision making in particular.
""Heightened uncertainty and subdued general economic conditions in turn contributed to the first outright fall in new work received by construction firms for just over three years,"" Moore said.
Moore did mention that the pick-up in staff hiring was the fastest since the beginning of the year which contrasted with the falling new order volumes.
âAn optimistic interpretation is that construction firms are looking through the second quarter weakness,â Moore explained.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto industry sales fell 6 percent in May, with General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and other manufacturers reporting lower U.S. vehicle sales for the month due to sluggish demand for sedans and two fewer selling days.
Major automakers reporting May sales on Wednesday sold new vehicles at an annualized rate of 17.45 million vehicles, Autodata Corp said, up from 17.42 million vehicles in April. The May annualized rate was generally in line with analysts' expectations.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said its sales fell 18 percent to 240,450 vehicles, a steeper decline than analysts expected.
Ford reported a 6 percent drop to 235,997 vehicles from a year earlier, but said its F-Series pickup truck sales rose 9 percent.
In the morning, sales reports, particularly GM's, spooked investors on the lookout for weakness in the cyclical auto industry, which has been on an upswing since the Great Recession.
GM shares ended down 3.4 percent at $30.20 and Ford down 2.8 percent at $13.11, both higher than lows hit in the morning. The broader S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) were up less than 0.1 percent.
Analysts generally did not view the sales decline as the start of the anticipated weakness in auto sales, an early snapshot of consumer spending each month. Most analysts had expected a drop, in large part because of two fewer selling days and one less weekend in May.
""The outlook ... remains for another record year, and nothing in Mayâs results suggests otherwise,"" said IHS Automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley.
Economic fundamentals remain strong and interest rates low, Brinley said.
GM was still bullish on U.S. auto sales. 
""We feel pretty good about the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer,"" said Dan Ammann, GM president, at a business conference in northern Michigan.
Trucks and SUVs, which generally offer higher profit margins, remained the U.S. industry's most popular vehicles, to the detriment of traditional sedans.
Ford U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the skew toward the larger vehicles ""really plays into Ford's wheelhouse."" 
The same can be said for the two other major U.S. automakers, GM and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA), which also have strong lineups and sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. 
Still, LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster said that while midsize sedans made up a smaller share of the overall market, it was still sizeable.
GM had slowed production at three plants that make sedans, which hurt May sales, the company said.
A year ago, the Cruze compact sedan was GM's top-selling car, but its sales fell 30 percent in May. The Malibu midsize sedan, which gained 13 percent, replaced it as the company's best seller in that category.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), No. 3 in the U.S. market behind GM and Ford, said its May sales dropped 9.6 percent to 219,339 vehicles.
Cars' share of Toyota's sales fell to 49 percent from 53 percent in May 2015.
Honda Motor Co's (T:7267) sales fell 4.8 percent, but unlike most automakers, the decline was steeper for its trucks and SUVs than for cars.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) showed an increase of nearly 12 percent for May on the strength of SUV sales. Its corporate sibling Kia Motors Co (KS:000270) increased sales nearly 1 percent.
Ford's car sales fell 25 percent. Sales were essentially flat for its SUVs and up 9 percent for trucks.
Among Ford sedan sales, the Fusion fell 21.5 percent, and the Focus dropped 27 percent. Sales rose 5.5 percent for the company's top-selling SUV, the Escape.
FCA said its sales rose 1 percent to 204,452 vehicles on a 14 percent gain for its Jeep SUV brand. The company was the only major automaker in the U.S. market for which analysts had not expected a decline.
FCA's Ram pickup truck sales fell 3 percent in May but were still up 8 percent for this year.
Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said its sales fell 1 percent, as its car sales fell 6 percent but its truck and SUV sales rose 6 percent. 

In 2015, vehicle sales were a record 17.47 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing grew for a third straight month in May, but factories appeared to be taking in fewer deliveries from their suppliers, which could hamper production in the months ahead.
Other data on Wednesday showed automobile sales slowing last month and a sharp drop in construction spending in April, bucking the recent flow of relatively strong data that suggested economic growth was regaining speed in the second quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose half a percentage point to a reading of 51.3 last month, with a jump in prices paid by factories for raw materials also accounting for the increase.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index surged five points to a reading of 54.1 last month. A reading above 50 in this index indicates slower deliveries.
""The rise in the ISM exaggerates the underlying tone in the U.S. manufacturing sector. While the jump in supplier deliveries is a good thing from an inventory perspective, it is perhaps a signal of weaker production activity ahead,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
U.S. stocks were little changed, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose. 
Manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of the dollar's surge and oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015. The sector has also been hurt by business efforts to reduce an inventory glut, which has resulted in fewer orders being placed with factories.
Although the dollar's rally is fading and oil prices are steadily rising, economists do not expect a strong bounce back in factory activity. 
New orders received by factories were little changed in May, production tumbled and order backlogs shrank. New export orders were unchanged and factory employment continued to contract. There was also an increase in the number of manufacturers reporting that customers' inventories were too high.
PERSISTENT WEAKNESS
While the ISM index has remained in expansion territory for three consecutive months, so-called hard manufacturing data has been generally weak. The government reported last week that orders for long-lasting manufactured capital goods, excluding defense and aircraft, fell in April for a third straight month.
A separate manufacturing survey from data firm Markit showed factory activity in May was the weakest since September 2009.
""A turnaround in manufacturing is going to take time, it's not going to happen overnight,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Separately, reports from auto manufacturers showed weak demand for sedans and fewer selling days holding down motor vehicle sales in May.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), reported a 6 percent drop in sales last month from a year earlier. It estimated overall U.S. sales would decrease by about 8 percent in May. 
General Motors Co (N:GM), the largest U.S. automaker, reported an 18 percent decline in sales last month. Weak auto sales would suggest a slowdown in consumer spending in May after posting its largest increase since August 2009 in April.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending tumbled 1.8 percent, the largest decline since January 2011, after an upwardly revised 1.5 percent jump in March. Construction spending was previously reported to have increased 0.3 percent in March.
The weak auto sales and construction reports interrupted the stream of bullish data - including consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing - which have bolstered views the economy was regaining speed after growth braked to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.
As a result of the soft report, the Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its second-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent rate.

However, the sharp upward revision to March's construction spending suggests the government's first-quarter GDP growth estimate could be revised higher.

JPMorgan's Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), produced with Markit, came in at 50.0 last month, right on the level that separates growth from contraction. It was 50.1 in April.

The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index was 51.3, beating the expectation for a slump to 50.3.
This showed that the sector expanded in May for a third straight month, even after forecasts for a contraction following several weak regional surveys.
Most  regional manufacturing surveys missed expectations in May, suggesting that the sector was still reeling from its recent slowdown triggered by weak demand and a strong dollar.
According to ISM, new orders and production continued to rise, but at a slower pace. Manufacturing employment shrank again at an unchanged pace, while the drop in inventories picked up speed.
In a separate report, which painted a different picture, Markit's final manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) for May was 50.7.
It slowed a bit from 50.8 in April due to lower production, and had been expected at 50.5.
Underneath the headline beat, the details of the report showed that output fell for the first time since September 2009. New orders rose at the slowest pace since last December, as client demand stayed low.
""Payroll numbers are under pressure as factories worry about slower order book growth, in part linked to falling export demand but also as a result of growing uncertainty surrounding the presidential election,"" said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson."

The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose more than expected to 50.1 in May from April's
slightly upwardly revised 49.4, the lowest reading since early 2013. Economists in a Reuters poll expected a 49.6 figure.
But the index was only a fraction above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction, and below levels seen at the start of 2016. Official figures show manufacturing failed to contribute to overall growth throughout 2015 and early 2016.
""The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter,"" Rob
Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said.
""There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum
are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general.""
Britain's economy slowed in the first three months of the year, and recent data showed business investment fell in annual terms for the first time in three years as uncertainty over the
June 23 referendum weighed on sentiment. 
Many economists expect the economy to weaken further in the second quarter. The Bank of England has said a vote to leave the EU could even tip the economy into recession.
The Markit survey showed that the investment goods industry struggled in May, with production falling at the fastest pace in three and a half years.
But there was somewhat better news on overall new orders, which rose in May.
Input prices rose at the fastest rate since February 2014, due to a weaker exchange rate and higher oil and metals prices.

An end may be in sight for near-zero inflation as firms said they were passing some of this rise on to consumers.
Annual consumer price inflation stands at 0.3 percent, and last month the BoE forecast it would take two years before it
returned to target, assuming Britain voted to stay in the EU.

Analysts had expected the index to advance to 49.6 in May.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit also noted that it added a special question to this month's survey regarding the upcoming June 23 referendum on the U.K.'s membership in the European Union.
Over a third of respondents saw a ""detrimental impact on their business from uncertainty regarding the forthcoming vote, within which 8% indicated that the impact was âstronglydetrimentalâ.""
Despite edging past the stagnation point in May, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said that the data showed a continuation of a âlackluster start to 2016â and noted that the sector would âremain a drag on the broader economic growth, adding pressure on the service sector to sustain the upturn in GDP (gross domestic product).â

LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity growth remained lacklustre last month, a survey showed on Wednesday, supporting the view that strong economic growth in the first quarter did not carry through to the second.
Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone dipped to a three-month low of 51.5 from
April's 51.7, unchanged from an earlier flash reading.
""Manufacturing in the euro area remained stuck in a state of near-stagnation in May, failing to break out of the slow growth phase that has plagued producers since February,"" said Chris
Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
""The disappointing performance of manufacturing adds to suspicions that the pace of euro zone economic growth in the
second quarter has cooled after a surprisingly brisk start to the year based on the latest estimate of GDP.""
Gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent in the first
quarter, figures showed last month, and is expected to expand just 0.3 percent this quarter, according to a May Reuters poll.
In the Markit survey a subindex measuring manufacturing output, which feeds into Friday's composite PMI, confirmed the
preliminary estimate of a fall from April's 52.6 to 52.4. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
The slowdown came despite factories cutting their prices again. An index measuring output prices rose to 48.8 from 47.4,
holding below the 50 mark for a ninth month.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 52.1 in May from 51.8 in April.
The reading was the highest since January and above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction. It was lower than the flash reading of 52.4, however.
Production also posted its strongest increase since January, while manufacturers raised hiring for the second month running even as job creation remained unchanged from April and modest overall.
""New business also continued to rise despite subdued demand from international markets hindering a stronger expansion,"" said Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike. ""Nevertheless, the survey data suggest that the overall rate of growth in German manufacturing remains lacklustre.""
Input prices fell at their slowest rate since December 2015, leading manufacturers to raise their output prices.
""In a sign that companies expect prices for inputs to increase in the future, some firms raised their purchasing
activity during the month. Nonetheless, overall input costs continued to decline, although at the slowest pace in 2016 so far.""

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was unchanged from April at 50.1 last month, barely above the 50-mark that separates expansion in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to dip to 50.0.
The output sub-index rose to 52.3, compared with 52.2 in April, indicating production remains solid despite efforts by the government to curb overcapacity that is plaguing sectors such as steel and coal.
But total new orders expanded at a slower pace, while growth in export orders stalled.
And manufacturers continued to shed jobs, albeit not as rapidly as in April. The employment sub-index was 48.2, compared to 47.8 in the previous month and the slowest pace in 12 months.
Prices of raw materials continued to rise but at a slower pace (55.3) as a speculative bubble deflated. Prices for several steel products fell over 20 percent in May.
A record credit binge in the first quarter boosted investment and industrial output in March, fanning hopes that the economy was picking up, but Chinese banks sharply cut back new lending in April and the growth of M2 money supply slowed.
Weaker April economic data and hints of a shift in the government's aggressive stimulus programme have also raised concerns over whether the March bounce is sustainable.
Global financial markets have been buzzing over whether China is shifting to a more cautious policy stance since an article in the People's Daily in early May that warned about the dangers of relying on too much debt to stimulate the economy. But signals remain mixed.
A similar survey showed activity in China's services sector continued to expand but at a slower pace, with the official reading at 53.1 in May versus 53.5 in April.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to help offset the prolonged downdraft from manufacturing, and hopes that services will create jobs for some of the millions of factory workers who are expected to lose their jobs as the government tries to cut industrial overcapacity.

The Markit/Nikkei Final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 47.7 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was slightly above a preliminary reading of 47.6 but below a final 48.2 in April.
The index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the third month and showed that activity shrank at the fastest pace since January 2013.
The aftermath of earthquakes in southern Japan in April may still be weighing heavily on some producers, a statement from Markit said, but it noted foreign demand also contracted sharply.
The index for new orders fell to 44.7, which was revised up from a preliminary 44.1 but still showed the fastest decline since December 2012. In April the index for new orders was 45.0.
Export orders also fell at a faster pace than in April. Some of the respondents to the survey mentioned the impact of a stronger yen and tougher international competition.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to announce a delay to next year's proposed sales tax hike to prevent a further blow to the economy, when he speaks to members of the media on Wednesday.

Some economists say such a decision would be an indication that three years of Abe's reflationary policies have failed to fundamentally strengthen the economy and shift growth into a higher gear.

""Readings for the output and new order categories fell again, but employment improved slightly.

The manufacturing PMI jointly released by the China Federation of Logistics and the Purchasing and National Bureau of Statistics said in an accompanying statement that the PMI headline number has remained slightly above 50 for several months, suggesting that the economy has established a bottom with smaller downside room and that the recovery momentum is gaining speed.
But CFLP said a worsening oversupply issue is also hurting business expectations, with the sub-index falling sharply to 55.9 in May from April's 60.3.
The non-manufacturing PMI for May from CFLP came in at 53.1, down from 53.5 the previous month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese capital expenditure accelerated in the first quarter from the prior three-month period, suggesting gross domestic product growth could be revised up, but analysts remain wary about the outlook given growing pressure on corporate earnings.
Indeed, corporate profits in January-March fell at the fastest pace in more than four years, which could encourage Japanese companies to cut back on future capital expenditure plans.
The data suggests that revised GDP due on June 8 may show Japan's economy in the Jan-March quarter grew more than first reported, but a host of other indicators have pointed to a recovery straining against weak consumption and exports.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected on Wednesday to delay an increase in the nationwide sales tax as worries about weak consumer spending undermine the government's argument that its policies are working to reflate the economy.
""I expect a slight upward revision to GDP, but that doesn't mean everything is rosy,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""Earnings growth has peaked out, because companies are no longer benefiting from a weak yen. If profits continue to fall, companies could put the brakes on capex.""
Capital expenditure in January-March rose 4.2 percent year-on-year, slower than a 8.5 percent annual gain in October-December, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.
However, capital expenditure rose 1.4 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis after excluding spending on software, which marked a recovery from a 0.1 percent decline in October-December.
A preliminary estimate showed GDP in the January-March expanded an annualized 1.7 percent. The capital expenditure component of GDP fell 1.4 percent from the previous quarter.

Corporate profits fell 9.3 percent in January-March from a year ago, the biggest decline since October-December 2011, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in more than six years in April as households stepped up purchases of automobiles, suggesting an acceleration in economic growth that could persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon.
Though other data on Tuesday showed an ebb in consumer confidence in May, spending is likely to remain supported by strong gains in house prices, as well as a strengthening labor market, which is steadily pushing up wages. 
""This takes the Fed a step and a half closer to the next increase in interest rates,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Â 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday an interest rate hike would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if the economy continued to pick up and the labor market added jobs. Her views were similar to those expressed in minutes from the Fed's April 26-27 policy meeting published recently.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 1.0 percent last month as households bought a range of goods and services. 
Last month's increase was the largest since August 2009 and beat economists' expectations for a 0.7 percent rise. 
Strong consumption lifted inflation last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in March. That left the increase in the year-on-year core PCE rate at 1.6 percent.
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. Economists expect inflation to continue creeping higher this year, citing the dollar's fading rally and a gradual increase in oil prices and wages. 
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 61 percent chance of an interest rate increase at the July 26-27 Fed policy meeting, according to CME FedWatch. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell. Prices for U.S. government debt were little changed.
BRIGHTENING OUTLOOK
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending shot up 0.6 percent, the biggest gain since February 2014, after being flat in March.
The strong consumer spending report joined data on goods exports, industrial production, housing starts and home sales in suggesting the economy was regaining momentum after growing at a lackluster 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 2.9 percent rate in the second quarter. 
The brightening economic outlook was dimmed somewhat by a separate report from the Conference Board showing its consumer confidence index slipped to 92.6 this month from a reading of 94.7 April. 
Households also had a less favorable view of the labor market. The share of respondents saying jobs were ""plentiful"" was little unchanged at 24.3 percent, while those reporting that jobs are ""hard to get"" increased to 24.4 percent from 22.8 percent in April.
Still, households continued to expect their incomes to increase. 
In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business index fell 1.1 points to a reading of 49.3 in May, indicating a contraction in manufacturing activity in the Midwest. The decline mirrors other regional surveys and suggests national factory activity likely slumped in May after two straight months of growth.
Despite the retreat in consumer confidence and weakness in manufacturing, rising incomes and higher house price are likely to prop up consumption. A fourth report showed the S&P/Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.4 percent in March from a year ago.
""Consumer spending will continue to lead economic growth in 2016, as more jobs, rising wages and house prices give households more money to spend,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Last month, consumer spending was buoyed by a 2.3 percent jump in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods, with automobiles accounting for most of the increase. Purchases of nondurable goods surged 1.4 percent and spending on services increased 0.6 percent.
Personal income increased 0.4 percent last month after rising by the same margin in March. Wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in March. 

With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $751.1 billion last month from $809.4 billion in March.

FRANKFURTBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone prices fell less in May and corporate lending extended its recovery in April, data showed on Tuesday, giving the European Central Bank some arguments for keeping monetary policy on hold when it meets on Thursday.
The ECB has embarked on a 1.74 trillion euros ($1.94 trillion) money-printing program to revive inflation and growth in the euro zone, but the bank has little to show for it, more than a year since purchase started.
Consumer prices fell in the euro zone by 0.1 percent in May after declining 0.2 percent in April, thanks to a smaller drop in energy prices and an increase in the price of services, Eurostat data showed.
Loans to euro zone companies grew by 1.2 percent in April - the best rate since November 2011 and a touch above the previous month, according to the ECB.
The readings were likely to help the ECB reaffirm its wait-and-see stance at Thursday's meeting. The central bank was also expected to nudge up its inflation forecast for this year and next after a recent stabilization in oil prices.
But the overall economic pictures remained weak. Even excluding energy prices, inflation in the euro zone was just 0.8 percent in May, far from the ECB's target of almost 2 percent.
And growth in loans to households, the biggest consumers of credit in the euro zone and a key driver of its 18-month-old lending recovery, slowed for the first time since February 2015.
""The ECB message on Thursday will be that things seem to be going better,"" Clemente De Lucia, an economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), said. ""But we start from low levels: inflation remains weak and, with growth just above potential ... downside pressures on prices remain.""
The ECB may need to announce as early as September that its program of buying 80 billion euros worth of assets a month will be extended beyond its current end-date in March 2017, De Lucia added.
The bank has already said purchases would continue until inflation reaches satisfactory levels and repeatedly expanded the scope of the program, which from June will include corporate bonds.
Next month the bank will also start paying banks to take its money, provided that they lend it on to the economy.
""As much of the effect of the big March easing package is still in the pipeline, a 'wait and see' stance makes sense,"" said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg.

428,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2016 04:41AM ET</span>",German unemployment rate falls to record low in May,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment fell more than expected in May and the jobless rate sank to its lowest level in more than 25 years, boosting expectations that private consumption will continue to drive growth in Europe's biggest economy this year.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.695 million, the Labour Office said, more than double the Reuters consensus forecast for a fall of 5,000.
""The labour market continues its overall positive development,"" Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Office, said in a statement. ""Unemployment fell in the course of spring. Employment rose sharply and the demand for labour also increased significantly.""
The adjusted unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent, its lowest level since German reunification in 1990. The rate had held at 6.2 percent for four consecutive months.
Separate data from the Federal Statistics Office showed that seasonally adjusted employment, as measured by the International Labour Organisation, rose by 41,000 to more than 43.4 million in April.
The government expects employment to reach a record 43.5 million this year and nearly 44 million in 2017. That should further propel domestic demand and push up tax revenue, enabling the government to increase state spending.
The German economy expanded by 1.7 percent in 2015, its strongest rate in four years, mainly driven by robust private consumption and higher state spending on refugees. It is expected to grow by around the same amount this year.
""The economic impulse is perfectly timed and should dampen labour market worries caused by high immigration and the minimum wage,"" said KfW bank economist Joerg Zeuner.
More than one million migrants arrived in Germany last year, raising fears that unemployment would rise as it is hard to integrate them into the labour market.

The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, confounded expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.9 percent rise on the month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Tuesday. The data for March was revised down to a decline of 1.4 from a previously reported fall of 1.1 percent.

On the year, retail sales rose by 2.3 percent in real terms, a marked increase compared with a downwardly revised increase of 0.6 percent the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a weaker rise of 1.9 percent.

431,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2016 11:15PM ET</span>","Japan factory output unexpectedly rises, economy still in low gear","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output unexpectedly rose in April as a series of earthquakes in the southern part of the country appeared to have had minimal impact on production, offering some signs of hope for an economy squeezed by weak exports and consumption.
Household spending also fell less than expected in April and job availability hit a 24-year high, a relief for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is expected to delay a scheduled sales tax hike next year to avoid dealing a hammer blow to a fragile economic recovery.
""The effect on output from the earthquakes may linger and inventory levels remain high. But the chance Japan can avert a big slump in second-quarter GDP has risen,"" said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Global Insight.
Factory output rose 0.3 percent in April from the previous month, confounding market forecasts for a 1.5 percent drop and following a 3.8 percent gain in March, data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Tuesday.
The better-than-expected data triggered a brief rebound in the yen that pushed the dollar off its one-month high against the Japanese currency.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 2.2 percent in May and increase 0.3 percent in June, suggesting that industrial production has bottomed out.
Japanese policy makers have been fighting a battle to fire up the world's third-largest economy, but massive fiscal and monetary stimulus over the past three years have failed to stoke sustainable growth or inflation.
SIGNS OF HOPE
The earthquakes in Kumamoto, southern Japan, hit only a small portion of auto output with other sectors left largely unaffected. Machinery equipment output rose in a sign of pick-up in capital expenditure, the data showed.
But some analysts warn of lingering external headwinds such as sluggish emerging market demand that is expected to keep any rebound in economic activity modest at best.
""We can be relieved somewhat about the effects of the Kumamoto earthquakes. On the other hand, output has been weak due to global economic situations. That part hasn't changed much,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""There are some positive moves (in the global market), but emerging markets are still slowing down and weakness remains in U.S. production, too.""
In a glimmer of hope, separate data showed household spending fell 0.4 percent in April from a year earlier, much less than a 1.4 percent decline projected by analysts.
Japan's jobless rate was steady at 3.2 percent in April and the jobs-applicants ratio rose to 1.34, the highest level since November 1991, data showed on Tuesday.
Japan's economy narrowly averted recession in the first three months of this year and analysts expect only a modest rebound in the current quarter as sluggish global demand and tame wage growth weigh on exports and consumption.

Abe, well aware of the risks, has told ruling party officials that he plans to postpone next year's sales tax hike to ensure Japan plays its part to fend off risks of a global economic downturn.

The brisker growth figures, which augured well for the government's 1.5 percent target for the full year, were the latest positive developments for the euro zone's second-largest economy, where unemployment has finally started to decline and consumers are more optimistic despite strikes and protests.
A poll of 15 analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast French gross domestic product (GDP) to remain at the 0.5 percent that INSEE had initially reported in its preliminary estimate. With the revised figure, it was only the second time in three years that growth came in above 0.5 percent in France.
Growth in the quarter to end-March was driven by a 1.0 percent surge in consumer spending, with INSEE revising sharply upward its March figure in a separate release, and a 1.6 percent increase in investment.
The strong increase in domestic demand offset a negative contribution from international trade, which shaved 0.2 percentage points off first-quarter GDP, although that was less than the 0.6 points it subtracted in the fourth quarter.
With 1.1 percent of growth carry-over at the end of the first quarter, analysts say President Francois Hollande's 1.5 percent target for the full-year seems all but assured, barring any nasty surprise in the remainder of the year.

Combined sales at department stores run by  Hyundai Department  Store (KS:069960),  Lotte Shopping  (KS:023530) and  Shinsegae  Co (LS:004170) rose 4.3 percent in April from a year earlier, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.
This accelerated from a 0.3 percent growth in March and was the best performance since a 9.0 percent jump in January.
An extra public holiday in mid-April thanks to the parliamentary election helped boost sales, which were also underpinned by warmer-than-usual weather, the trade ministry said.
Sales of well known foreign brands rose the most among department store goods, surging 8.6 percent on-year in April as the average daily high temperature last month reached 20.3 degrees Celsius, up from 18.8 degrees last April.
The same data showed discount store sales rose 1.7 percent in April from a year earlier, rebounding from a 4.6 percent decline in March.
Sales were also helped by the additional holiday and warmer weather as apparel saw the most demand out of discount store goods, the trade ministry data said.

Preliminary data from the finance ministry had shown April department store sales would rise 8.0 percent on-year and discount store sales up by 0.2 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales fell in April for the second consecutive month, bolstering the argument that a nationwide sales tax increase scheduled for April next year should be delayed.
Japanese retail sales fell 0.8 percent in April from a year earlier, less than a median market forecast for a 1.2 percent annual decline, government data showed on Monday. That marked the fastest decline since March 2015.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will delay the tax hike by two and a half years, sources told Reuters, due to worries the move could push down consumer spending even further and possibly hasten a return to deflation.
""Consumer spending is stagnating,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Wages are rising and people are worried about high food prices. I can understand why the government would want to delay this tax hike.""
Compared to the previous month, retails sales were unchanged in April, a slowdown from March when they rose by 1.5 percent.
Abe told Finance Minister Taro Aso and the secretary general of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Sadakazu Tanigaki, on Saturday of his plan to propose delaying the tax hike for a second time, until October 2019, a source told Reuters.
The prime minister, who has promised to announce steps on Tuesday to spur economic growth and promote structural reform, is also expected to order an extra budget to fund stimulus measures, just two months into the fiscal year and on the heels of a supplementary budget to pay for recovery from recent earthquakes in southern Japan.
The plan to raise the sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent has already been delayed once after an increase to 8 percent from 5 percent in April 2014 hit consumption and knocked the economy into recession.

Abe swept into office three years ago with bold plans to end decades of deflation and bring about sustainable growth. Unprecedented monetary policy in tandem with fiscal stimulus met with some initial success, but consumer spending has struggled due to weak gains in wages.

453,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2016 03:03PM ET</span>",U.S. economic growth revised higher in first quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter although not as sharply as initially thought, as a surge in home building and steady inventory accumulation partially offset the drag from a steep decline in business investment.
Gross domestic product rose at a 0.8 percent annual rate as opposed to the 0.5 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate for the January-March period.
That was the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2015. The economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
But a sharp upward revision to income growth and a rebound in corporate profits in the first quarter brightened the picture. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate after expanding at a 1.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Economists said strong income growth, together with signs the economy was picking up steam in the second quarter, could give the Federal Reserve the ammunition to raise interest rates as early as next month. The U.S. central bank increased rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
""This gives us more confidence that growth will hit its marks in the second quarter ... enough forward speed for the Fed to continue with its gradual pace of rate hikes,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Minutes from the Fed's April 26-27 policy meeting, published last week, showed most of its policymakers considered it appropriate to raise rates in June if data continued to point to an improvement in second-quarter growth.
Similar sentiments were echoed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who said on Friday the U.S. central bank could hike rates ""in the coming months,"" if the economy and the labor market continued to improve.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar (DXY) rose to a two-month high against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher.
The upward revision to first-quarter GDP growth also reflected a modest hit from trade than previously estimated.
The economy has been hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have eroded export growth. It has also been squeezed by lower oil prices, which have undercut profits of oilfield companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), forcing them to slash spending on equipment.
Economists also believe the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite steps last year to address the problem. The economy has underperformed in the first quarter in five of the last six years.
REGAINING MOMENTUM
The economy appears to have regained momentum early in the second quarter, with retail sales, goods exports, industrial production, housing starts and home sales surging in April.
A report on Friday showed consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in May, with households' attitudes towards vehicle and home purchases improving.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second-quarter GDP rising at a 2.9 percent rate.
Spending on residential construction increased at a 17.1 percent rate in the first quarter, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012. It was previously reported to have risen at a rate of 14.8 percent.
Residential construction added 0.56 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth, up from the 0.49 percentage point reported last month.
Businesses accumulated $69.6 billion worth of inventory, instead of the $60.9 billion estimated last month. Inventories cut two-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.33 percentage point.
There was no revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Spending increased at a pace of 1.9 percent, a slowdown from the fourth quarter's 2.4 percent rate. Households were frugal in the first quarter, cutting back on purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods like automobiles. Income at the disposal of households after accounting fortaxes and inflation was revised up to show it jumping at a 4.0 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 2.9 percent. Savings were revised up to $782.6 billion from $712.3 billion.
""The softish real consumer spending in the last couple of quarters is probably temporary and spending is likely to rebound in the second quarter, reflecting continued solid income formation,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
After-tax corporate profits increased at a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter after plunging at an 8.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter, when they were held down in part by a $20.8 billion transfer payment related to the  BP  (L:BP) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
Exports were not as weak as initially thought. That, together with a decline in imports, produced a smaller trade deficit, which subtracted 0.21 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth instead of the 0.34 percentage point reported last month.
A sustained plunge in energy sector investment undercutbusiness spending. Equipment spending tumbled at a steeper 9.0 percent rate, the fastest pace of decline since the second quarter of 2009. It was previously reported to have dropped at a rate of 8.6 percent.

Spending on equipment will likely remain weak in the second quarter, with a report on Thursday showing orders for manufactured capital goods excluding aircraft and defense declined in April for a third straight month.

460,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2016 04:40AM ET</span>",China May official factory PMI may mark end to two-month expansion,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's vast manufacturing sector likely stalled in May after slight expansions in the previous two months, a Reuters poll showed, throwing more cold water on hopes that the world's second-largest economy is reviving.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to fall to 50.0 from 50.1 in April, according to a median forecast of 31 economists polled.
The index will likely show that a two-month, credit-fueled expansion in March and April was short-lived and that a solid recovery in the manufacturing sector has not taken hold.
The official PMI was in contraction territory for the seven months prior to March's surprise gain.
Most economic data grew more slowly in April after a surprise rebound in March, feeding doubts that the economy is stabilizing.
A record credit binge in the first quarter boosted investment and industrial output in March, but Chinese banks sharply cut back new lending in April and the growth of M2 money supply slowed.
""With concerns about rising debt, we do not believe we will see massive monetary stimulus. Our view is for a further slowdown in the economy, but not a hard landing. We think China is experiencing an ongoing soft landing"", said Frederik Kunze, an economist at NORD/LB.
""There will be a transformation of the growth model in China, and this will happen at the expense of the manufacturing sector,"" he said.
Profit growth at China's industrial companies slowed in April, data on Friday showed. Profits rose 4.2 percent in April, sharply decelerating from an 11.1 percent gain the previous month.
Global financial markets have been buzzing over whether China is shifting to a more cautious policy stance since an article in the People's Daily early this month, but signals remain mixed.
The official newspaper quoted an ""authoritative person"" as saying China may suffer a financial crisis or recession if the government relies too much on debt-fueled stimulus to boost flagging economic growth.
The Ministry of Finance said on Thursday the government could increase its own leverage ratio in order to avoid negative economic impacts of an overall contraction in debt levels, while at the same time highlighting the need to tighten checks on local government debt issuance.
The official manufacturing PMI data will be released on June 1, along with the official services PMI.
The Markit/Caixin factory PMI, a private and separate gauge of manufacturing activity, will also be released on June 1.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the Caixin PMI, which focuses on smaller companies, to show factory activity shrank for the 15th straight month in May, with the headline PMI seen easing to 49.3 from 49.4 in April.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell for the second straight month in April as weak consumption discouraged firms from raising prices, stoking fears of deflation and keeping pressure on the central bank to do more to hit its ambitious inflation target.
A separate index calculated by the Bank of Japan also showed consumer inflation slowing to a near one-year low, casting doubt on its argument that underlying price trend is improving steadily thanks to its massive stimulus program.
The data underscores the fragile nature of Japan's recovery and may give Prime Minister Shinzo Abe justification to delay a scheduled increase in sales tax next year.
A recent Reuters poll added to the gloom, showing a strong majority of Japanese firms surveyed now expect no escape from deflation for the foreseeable future.
""We're seeing downward pressure on inflation not only from energy but from food prices,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Both prices and the economy are weak, so expectations for further BOJ easing will heighten,"" he said.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes energy but excludes volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.3 percent in April from a year earlier, matching the drop in March which was the biggest annual decline in three years.
In a sign price falls will persist, core consumer prices in the Tokyo area - a leading indicator of nationwide tendencies - fell 0.5 percent in May, more than a median forecast for a 0.4 percent drop, the government data showed on Friday.
Some analysts warned that Japan may be returning to deflation, despite Abe's stimulus policies to eradicate such sustained price declines, including three years of aggressive money printing by the BOJ.
""The (CPI data) marks a change in the price trend and is a sign Japan is reverting back to deflation,"" said Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, adding that the BOJ may ease policy at next month's rate review.
BACK TO DEFLATION?
The BOJ hopes a moderate economic recovery will keep boosting corporate profits, allowing firms to increase wages and nudge consumers into spending more. Robust consumption will allow companies to raise prices and help accelerate inflation.
Last year, some companies passed on rising import costs from a weak yen on households. That trend has subsided this year due to the yen's rebound and weak consumer demand, analysts say.
The BOJ's internal index that strips away energy and fresh food prices but includes processed food costs, showed consumer inflation slowed to 0.9 percent in April from a year earlier versus 1.1 percent in March.
It was the first time since July 2015 that the index had fallen below 1 percent, casting doubt on the BOJ's view that underlying trend inflation was improving steadily.
The BOJ stunned markets in January by adding negative interest rates to its massive asset-buying program in a fresh effort to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target.
But the move has failed to improve public sentiment or arrest an unwelcome rise in the yen that hurts exports and weighs on inflation by pushing down import costs.
Anemic inflation has forced the BOJ to push back the expected timing for hitting its price target to around early 2018, though many analysts say even the new forecast is too ambitious, given slow wage growth and a sluggish economy.
Japan narrowly averted recession in the first quarter of this year and many analysts expect it to barely grow in the current quarter as weak emerging market demand weighs on exports and tame wage growth hits household spending.

That followed a 1.1 percent annual rise in March.
The BOJ currently uses the government's core CPI, which excludes fresh food but includes energy costs, as its key price measurement in guiding monetary policy. That index fell 0.3 percent in April from the prior year, data released earlier on Friday showed.
With core CPI now stagnant due largely to slumping oil prices, the central bank has begun internally calculating a new index that shows inflation exceeding government data. That index strips away volatile fresh food and energy costs but includes processed and imported food prices, which are rising.

The BOJ has said it would release the index each month on the day the government publishes its price data.

466,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2016 11:10PM ET</span>",China April industrial profit growth slows from March,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed in April, in line with other data for the month which suggested the economy may be losing steam again after picking up earlier in the year.
China's industrial firms made 502 billion yuan ($76.59 billion) in profits last month, up 4.2 percent from the same period last year and compared with growth of 11.1 percent in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.
For the first four months of the year, profits reached 1.84 trillion yuan, a 6.5 percent gain from a year earlier but down from a 7.4 percent rise in the first quarter. The data covers large firms with at least 20 million yuan of annual revenue.
Product inventories at industrial firms fell 1.2 percent year on year at end April, the first drop in recent years, the statistics bureau said, without giving details.
A return to profit growth early this year and a rebound in commodities prices such as steel had sparked hopes that China's industrial sector was finally perking up after a protracted downturn that has dragged on the world's second-largest economy.
But a string of disappointing economic data for April and a sharp reversal in raw material prices in recent weeks suggest the outlook for China's industrial sector remains challenging.
Indeed, sectoral performance remained highly uneven.
Oil refiners' profits rose more than 80-fold in January-April on-year, while steel mills saw a 42 percent gain as prices rebounded and they upped production. But coal miners saw profits fall 92.2 percent, while oil and gas producers posted a loss.
Profits in the manufacturing sector rose 13.3 percent in January-April, indicating relative strength in the sector despite stubbornly weak exports.
Debt at Chinese industrial companies increased 4.8 percent on an annual basis to 55.8 trillion yuan as of end-April, compared with a 5.2 percent rise in March.
China's growing debt and risks to its financial system have topped investors' worry lists this year, but the mood in Beijing seems to have shifted as the government expresses concerns about the dangers of too much debt-fueled stimulus.
A May 9 commentary in the People's Daily said China will not use excessive investment or high credit growth to boost growth.
Profits at state-owned firms fell 8.4 percent in January-April on-year, data showed earlier this week.

A survey of over 2,000 firms by the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business found the industrial economy did not stabilize in the first quarter, with excess capacity at a record high.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark slashed its estimate for economic growth this year to 1.1 percent from the 1.9 percent it forecast in December, according to a government report seen by Reuters on Thursday.
The government also cut its growth forecast for 2017, to 1.7 percent from 2.0 percent, the paper - which is due on Friday - showed.
The Scandinavian country's export-driven economy, which grew 1.2 percent last year, is dependent on the fortunes of its larger neighbors, with 15 percent of foreign sales going to Germany and 10 percent to Sweden.
Several banks and other organizations have cut their 2016 growth forecast in recent months, with Nordea and Citi estimating 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. 
The report also said the government's budget deficit should come in at 2.0 percent of GDP this year rather than the 2.8 percent forecast earlier. The EU threshold is 3 percent.
Inflation should hit 0.4 percent in 2016, down from the 0.9 percent earlier expected.

472,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2016 01:53PM ET</span>","U.S. business spending mired in weakness, but economy picking up","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business spending intentions weakened in April for a third straight month amid soft demand for machinery, but a surge in contracts to purchase previously owned homes to a 10-year high supported views economic growth was gaining speed.
The growth picture was further boosted by another report on Thursday showing the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pushing them back to near cycle lows. 
""Overall domestic growth momentum appears to be on the mend. Nevertheless, the weak performance in business capital investment activity suggests that this segment remains a source of drag for the U.S. economic recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.1 percent the prior month. These so-called core capital goods orders have now declined for three consecutive months. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.4 percent last month. 
The persistent decline in these orders comes as the manufacturing sector remains pressured by lower energy prices, which have eroded profits of energy companies and forced oilfield services firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) to slash capital spending budgets. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat, which has undercut new orders growth. A strong dollar has been a drag on exports.
Shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report - rose0.3 percent last month, reversing March's 0.3 percent drop.
Much of the factory sector weakness has been concentrated in the heavy machinery segment, where manufacturers have also been hurt by reduced demand for agricultural equipment. In April, orders for machinery tumbled 1.9 percent after dropping 0.8 percent in March.
U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower after recent strong gains, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index jumped 5.1 percent last month to its highest level since February 2006. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and April's surge pointed to further gains in home resales. 
The housing market is being underpinned by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, as well as still very low mortgage rates. But a shortage of properties available for sale remains a hurdle and house prices have risen faster than wages, sidelining some first-time buyers.
HEALTHY JOBS MARKET
A third report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended May 21.
Economists had forecast initial claims falling only to 275,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 64 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
The pending homes sales and jobless claims data joined reports on retail sales, housing and industrial production in suggesting the economy was gaining steam after growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annual pace in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is currently estimating second-quarter GDP growth at a 2.9 percent rate.
Despite the persistent weakness in business spending, the steady stream of fairly upbeat reports could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to raise interest rates again next month.
Minutes from the Fed's April 26-27 policy meeting, published last week, showed most officials considered it appropriate to raise rates in June if data continued to point to an improvement in second-quarter growth. 
With oil prices near $50 per barrel and the dollar's rally fading, there is hope for a manufacturing turnaround.
""Manufacturing has indeed bottomed out and with a gradual improving trend emerging, the exact degree of which remains to be ascertained in the period ahead,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
The Commerce Department report also showed orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, jumped 3.4 percent last month after increasing 1.9 percent in March.
The rise in durable goods orders last month was led by an 8.9 percent jump in bookings for transportation equipment. Orders for civilian aircraft soared 64.9 percent. There were increases in orders for motor vehicles, fabricated metal products, computers and electronic goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components.

Durable goods inventories declined further in April, a good sign for the manufacturing's future prospects, while unfilled orders increased 0.6 percent. Durable goods shipments rose 0.6 percent following two consecutive months of declines.

The increase in pending home sales for March also was revised marginally upward. Overall pending home sales last month were up 4.6 percent from a year ago.
The housing sector has steadily strengthened on the back of an economy near full employment and historically low mortgage rates.
Contracts rose in three of the nation's four regions, with the West reporting an 11.4 percent jump and the South showing a 6.8 percent increase.

The Midwest reported a 0.6 percent decline, but pending home sales in that region were still up 2.0 percent from a year ago.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended May 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims falling to 275,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 64 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. 
While the two consecutive weeks of decline helped to unwind some of the jump in claims between late April and early May, the trend in jobless claims has become less favorable.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,750 to 278,500 last week. 
Economists blame a range of factors for the recent spike in claims, including the different timing of school spring breaks, which often makes it difficult to adjust the data. An ongoing strike by Verizon (N:VZ) workers as well as possible disruptions to manufacturing activity in the wake of recent earthquakes in Japan have also been cited.
Economists expect the strike by the about 40,000 Verizon employees will hurt May payrolls because they would be considered unemployed as they would not have received a paycheck during the survey period. The government will release its closely watched employment report next Friday.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and only claims for Wyoming had been estimated. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 10,000 to 2.16 million in the week ended May 14. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims increased 8,500 to 2.15 million.
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's unemployment rate.

The four-week average of continuing claims fell 6,000 between the April and May survey periods. That suggests little change in the unemployment rate, which was at 5.0 percent in April.

481,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2016 05:49AM ET</span>",UK business investment falls ahead of EU referendum,"By Ana Nicolaci da Costa and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Business investment in Britain fell in early 2016, a sign that uncertainty caused by the country's impending referendum on European Union membership is weighing on companies.
Growth in the economy slowed to 0.4 percent in the January-March period, the Office for National Statistics confirmed on Thursday, and many economists said it might lose further momentum in the second quarter.
Business investment fell in annual terms for the first time in three years, depressed by weaker spending on offices and other non-residential buildings. Weak trade figures again dragged on growth, leaving consumers as the economy's drivers.
The services sector, which makes up 80 percent of the UK economy, showed signs of losing steam.
The Bank of England has previously said uncertainty hanging over the June 23 referendum was crimping investment, especially in the commercial real estate sector where transactions dropped 40 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Chris Hare, an economist with Investec, said the figures might suggest that a lot of the economic slowdown derives from concerns around the referendum, something which could lift quickly if the country votes to stay in the 28-nation EU.
""But the downside risk is that more of the slowdown relates to underlying weakness,"" Hare said. 
The ONS said the economy grew by 2.0 percent versus a year ago, below expectations that the data would confirm an initial estimate of 2.1 percent annual growth in the first quarter.
Business investment was weaker than expected, slackening by 0.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter after rising 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Business investment also declined compared with the fourth quarter although the 0.5 percent decline was less steep than a 2.0 percent fall between October and December 2015.
The government in recent weeks has stepped up its warnings of the risk of Britain leaving the EU, and the Bank of England recently said a Brexit could tip the economy into recession. 
World leaders and international organizations from U.S. President Barack Obama to the International Monetary Fund have echoed these concerns.
Earlier this month, the heads of 15 major international companies that are major investors in Britain, including GE, Cisco, Mars and Airbus, called for Britain to remain in the EU and said future investment decisions could be affected by a decision to leave the bloc's single market..
The BoE earlier this month cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent and also stepped up its warnings on the economic risks of Brexit.
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2015, the ONS said.
Household spending rose by 0.7 percent in the first quarter, picking up a bit of speed from late last year.
Consumer spending has been the main propellant of Britain's recovery from the financial crisis and policymakers have said they want to see greater investment by businesses to secure a more balanced economy.

In another sign of the slowdown, output in the services sector fell 0.1 percent in March, its first decline since August of last year.

PayNet's Canadian small business lending index tumbled to 119.1 in March from 124.3 the month before. An index of lending to medium-sized businesses similarly slumped to 206.5 from 225.0.
Canada's economy has been struggling to gain momentum since the plunge in oil prices put the country in a brief recession last year. 
""It's almost a contagion occurring,"" said PayNet President Bill Phelan of the dampening effect on the economy.
""It's becoming more prevalent among a broader swath of the economy.""
The Bank of Canada said on Wednesday that although growth looks to have picked up in the first quarter, business investment and intentions remain disappointing. 
By region, only Ontario and British Columbia saw activity improve. The two provinces have had relatively strong economies compared to regions that are tied to oil production. Lending in Alberta, where the country's oil sands are located, was down 21 percent compared to a year ago.
By industry, the manufacturing sector continued its trend of modest monthly increases but other sectors pulled back, including agriculture and retail.
The 30-day delinquency rate edged up to 1.09 percent, while the number of companies that were more than 90 days behind on their loans held steady at 0.32 percent.

The regional effect was visible there as well, with Alberta seeing the biggest increase in the 30-day delinquency rate, up 0.4 percent from a year ago.

The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, in line with market expectations.
Canadaâs central bank said that the global economy was evolving largely as expected.
âIn Canada, the economyâs structural adjustment to the oil price shock continues, but is proving to be uneven,â the bank said in the press release.
The BoC said that the second quarter will be much weaker than predicted because of the devastating Alberta wildfires.
Furthermore, the bankâs preliminary assessment is that fire-related destruction and the associated halt to oil production will cut about 1 1/4 percentage points off real GDP growth in the second quarter.
However, the BoC was confident that the economy would rebound in the third quarter, as oil production resumes and reconstruction begins.
âWhile the Canadian dollar has been fluctuating in response to shifting expectations of US monetary policy and higher oil prices, it is now close to the level assumed in April,â the bank noted.
Regarding price stability, the BoC considered inflation to be roughly in line with its expectations.
âMeanwhile, the risks to the bankâs inflation projection remain roughly balanced,â it added.

494,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2016 09:39AM ET</span>","Strong German business, consumer morale boost hopes for growth","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale improved more than expected in May, reaching its highest level so far this year and suggesting Europe's biggest economy will extend its surprisingly strong start to 2016 into the next quarters.
The German economy expanded by 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year, its strongest quarterly growth rate in two years, driven mainly by soaring private consumption and higher construction investment.
Analysts had expected the economy to lose steam over the summer months, but the Ifo index for May, released on Wednesday, suggested that any slowdown could be very limited.
In another positive sign for the German economy, consumer morale further improved heading into June as shoppers remained upbeat, the GfK survey showed on Wednesday.
""The German economy remains on track,"" NordLB analyst Christian Lips said. ""After an economic cooling in spring, due to the unusually strong first quarter, we can expect the economic upswing to gain pace again.""
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 107.7 in May from 106.7 in April.
This was the strongest reading since December 2015 and beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 106.8.
""The German economy is growing at a robust pace,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said, adding that companies were significantly more satisfied with their current business situation and noticeably more optimistic about the coming months.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the Ifo index showed that ""the worst nightmares of a global recession that spooked markets and economies in the first months of the year have clearly disappeared"".
The rise of the index was driven by improved sentiment in all four main sectors of industry, with business climate among construction firms hitting the highest level since 1991.
""BEST OF ALL WORLDS""
""The German construction industry is currently enjoying the best of all worlds,"" DZ bank economist Michael Holstein said. He noted that rising property prices and low interest rates are boosting private demand for homes while the public sector is also increasing construction investment.
The strong Ifo index came after a purchasing managers survey showed on Monday that growth in Germany's private sector accelerated in May to its highest point this year, suggesting the economy will remain on a solid growth track.
Germany's strong domestic demand is more than compensating for sluggish export growth as an economic slowdown in emerging markets such as China and a possible British exit from the European Union are clouding the outlook.
A survey showed on Tuesday that the mood among German analysts and investors worsened unexpectedly in May as external risks, including a Brexit, are dampening growth expectations.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said, however, that German companies do not appear to be concerned about the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union after a vote on June 23.
""In the German economy there does not seem to be any feeling of being unsettled with regard to the Brexit vote,"" he said, adding that private consumption was expected to remain an important growth driver in the course of the year.
He said the economy's strong performance in the first quarter and the robust May reading of the Ifo index pointed to an upward revision to the full-year growth forecast.

Germany's leading economic institutes said in mid-April they expected the economy to grow by 1.6 percent in 2016. The government predicts a GDP growth rate of 1.7 percent, on a par with last year.

510,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2016 02:30PM ET</span>","U.S. new homes sales hit eight-year high, point to firming economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales recorded their biggest gain in 24 years in April, touching a more than eight-year high as purchases increased broadly, a sign of growing confidence in the economy's prospects.
Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department, which also showed a surge in new home prices to a record high, offered further evidence of a pick-up in economic growth that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon.
""Consumers are taking the leap and buying the biggest of big ticket items of their lives and this speaks to confidence. The Federal Reserve can raise rates at their June meeting without fear the economy is going to slow,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
New home sales jumped 16.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000 units, the highest level since January 2008. The percent increase was the largest since January 1992.
Data for February and March were revised to show 39,000 more units sold than previously reported. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10.2 percent of the housing market, rising to only a 523,000 unit-rate last month.
New home sales increased broadly, with the exception of the Midwest. April's increase, however, probably exaggerates the housing market strength given that homebuilders confidence has stagnated since rising in January.
New home sales are extremely volatile month-to-month and preliminary figures are subject to large revisions because they are mostly drawn from building permits data. Still, last month's gain pushed new home sales well above their first-quarter average of 531,667 units. 
The new home sales report came in the wake of fairly upbeat data on home resales and residential construction. It also added to retail sales and industrial production reports in suggesting that the economy was gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. 
Minutes from the Fed's April 26-27 policy meeting, published last week, showed most officials considered it appropriate to raise rates in June if data continued to point to an improvement in second-quarter growth. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
HOUSING SHARES RALLY
The PHLX housing index (HGX) hit a one-month high on the new home sales data, with shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), increasing 4.3 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) jumping 4.7 percent. 
 Toll Brothers  (N:TOL) shares vaulted 7.6 percent, also boosted by a nearly 31 percent surge in quarterly revenue after the homebuilder sold more luxury homes at higher prices.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. government debt fell. 
The housing market is being underpinned by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, as well as still very low mortgage rates. But a shortage of properties available for sale remains a hurdle and house prices have risen faster than wages, sidelining some first-time buyers.
""The spring home buying season is in full swing as builders have been picking up steam through the first quarter,"" said Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.
""While the large jump in new home sales is encouraging, I would look for a normalization in the coming months that shows a slow but steady increase in the health of the housing market.""
Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market fell 0.4 percent to 243,000. At April's sales pace it would take 4.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.5 months in March. 
With supply tight, the median price for a new home increased 9.7 percent from a year ago to a record $321,100. The average price rose 13.5 percent from a year earlier to $379,800. New single-family homes sales soared 15.8 percent in the populous South to the highest level since December 2007. In the Northeast, sales jumped 52.8 percent to their highest level since October 2007.

Sales in the West, which have been volatile in recent months, rose 18.8 percent after plunging 15.2 percent in March. The West has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories. Single-family homes sales fell 4.8 percent in the Midwest.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Higher consumption and construction propelled German growth to its strongest quarterly rate in two years at the start of 2016, data showed on Tuesday, but risks including weaker trade and a potential British exit from the EU are seen slowing its pace.
The European Central Bank's ultra-low interest rates and the German government's increased spending on migrants were among factors singled out by analysts to explain GDP growth of 0.7 percent in Europe's largest economy in the first quarter.
""The calculation of consumers is pretty simple: If there are no interest rates on the bank account, then let's just fill the shopping bag,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that companies also increased investment in the first quarter.
A survey by think tank ZEW showed the mood among analysts and investors worsened unexpectedly in May, however, with its economic sentiment index falling to 6.4 points. A separate gauge of current conditions rose to 53.1 points.
""Uncertainties such as a possible Brexit do not allow a more optimistic outlook,"" ZEW president Achim Wambach said, adding investors had doubts that the economy would continue to grow at the same pace after the surprisingly strong first quarter.
Britons will vote in June 23 referendum on whether to stay in the EU.
Confirming its preliminary reading, the Statistics Office said consumer spending and construction investment contributed 0.2 percentage points each to GDP in the January-March period.
State spending -- including the costs of accommodating and integrating last year's record influx of the more than 1 million migrants -- and company investment in equipment and plants each contributed 0.1 percentage points to growth.
A purchasing managers survey showed on Monday that the private sector accelerated in May to its highest level this year, suggesting the economy will extend its surprisingly strong start into the second quarter.
""TURBO START""
Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce raised its 2016 growth forecast for the German economy to 1.5 percent from a previous estimate of 1.3 percent.
""Construction and consumption will drive this year's economic upswing,"" DIHK's managing director, Martin Wansleben, said, adding that low oil prices, cheap borrowing costs and increased state spending on migrants were positive factors.
On the downside, he said that Germany was getting little impetus from foreign demand. ""After the turbo start, the economy will grow at a slower pace in coming months,"" he said.
BayernLB economist Stefan Kipar said public spending on migrants was having a broad effect on domestic demand.
""The higher state spending on refugees is lifting private consumption through payment of social benefits,"" he said. ""And it's also giving the construction sector an additional push because more refugee shelters are being built.""
The government plans to spend 9.7 billion euros ($10.8 billion) on supporting and integrating refugees this year, in addition to 6.3 billion euros on combating the causes of migration from the Middle East and elsewhere.
The total sum of 16 billion euros is expected to rise in coming years, with Berlin planning to spend 93.6 billion euros overall by 2020 while keeping a balanced budget.
On top of this come several billion euros of spending on migrants by the federal states and municipalities.
Germany's strong domestic demand more than compensated for sluggish export growth as an economic slowdown in emerging markets such as China clouds the outlook.
Net foreign trade was a drag of 0.1 points as exports rose at a weaker pace than imports in the first quarter, data showed. Due to this trend, the government and the central bank both expect Germany's economic upswing to continue at a slower pace.

For 2016 as a whole, Berlin predicts a GDP growth rate of 1.7 percent, on a par with last year.

The median forecast in the survey of 13 economists was for industrial output to fall 0.3 percent in April year-on-year, after declining 0.5 percent in March.
On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, manufacturing output is seen rising 0.8 percent, the Reuters poll showed.
The April industrial production data is due on Thursday, May 26 at 1 p.m. local time (0500 GMT).
Data released last week showed that Singapore's non-oil domestic exports fell sharply in April from a year earlier, reinforcing the weak outlook for the trade-reliant economy. 
On top of pressure faced by exporters from slack global demand, Singapore's manufacturing sector has also taken a hit from a slide in global oil prices seen over the past two years. 

That has depressed demand for oil rigs built by the city-state's rig-building industry. Marine and offshore engineering output has slid nearly 30 percent in the first three months of 2016 compared to the same period a year earlier.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managersâ index (PMI) fell to 50.5 in May from the prior monthâs final reading of 50.8, which had been its weakest upturn since September 2009.
Analysts had expected an increase to 51.0 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Mayâs reading revealed only a marginal improvement in overall business conditions that was its weakest since the current upturn started in October 2009.
A renewed fall in production, its first decline since September 2009, was one key factor weighing on the headline index in May, according to the report, which also indicated softer new order growth, its weakest in 2016, along with further cuts to stocks of inputs.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said that âthe weak manufacturing data cast doubt on the ability of the U.S. economy to rebound from its disappointing start to the year in the second quarterâ.

527,By Investing.com,"<span>May 23, 2016 04:05AM ET</span>",Euro zone composite PMI drops to 16-month low in May,"Investing.com - Economic activity in the euro zone fell to a 16-month low in May, underlining concerns over the health of the region's economy, preliminary data showed on Monday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors dipped from 53.0 in April to 52.9 in May, below forecasts for 53.2.
The flash services purchasing managersâ index held steady at 53.1 this month, unchanged from April and missing expectations for a reading of 53.3.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managersâ index inched down to a seasonally adjusted 51.5 this month from a final reading of 51.7 in April. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 51.9 in May.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The May Flash PMI reinforced the picture of subdued growth of euro zone economic activity, with few signs of any imminent improvement. With new business growth also sliding to the lowest since January 2015, the survey data point to a strong likelihood of output growth remaining subdued or even weakening further in June.
The rate of business activity expansion in the dominant service sector was unchanged for a third successive month. The rate manufacturing output growth was meanwhile the second-weakest since February 2015.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, âA disappointing flash euro zone PMI for May adds further to the suggestion that the robust pace of economic growth seen in the first quarter will prove temporary. The PMI is signaling lackluster GDP growth of only 0.3% in the second quarter.â
EUR/USD was at 1.1212 from around 1.1222 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7732 from 0.7737 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.9%, Germany's DAX dropped 0.6%, Franceâs CAC 40 slumped 0.9%, while Londonâs FTSE 100 dipped 0.3%.

528,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>",German private sector growth accelerates in May: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated in May to hit the highest level so far this year, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting Europe's largest economy will extend its surprisingly strong start to the year into the second quarter.
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services activity that accounts for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 54.7 in May from 53.6 in April.
This was the highest reading since December 2015 and beat a Reuters consensus forecast of 53.8. The headline figure was comfortably above the 50 line that separates growth from
contraction, as it has been for 37 months.
The survey showed that an upturn in the manufacturing industry gained traction in May while growth in services picked up again after having slowed in April.
The PMI sub-index for manufacturing edged up to a five-month high of 52.4 as companies in the sector saw their output rise at the strongest rate so far this year.
The sub-index for business activity in services rose to 55.2, the strongest reading since February, with jobs being created at the fastest rate since December 2015.
Overall, new business in Germany's private sector grew at a slower pace with some companies attributing the slowdown partly to a weaker rise in new export orders placed with manufacturers.
Job creation accelerated, however, with employment growth hitting the highest level so far this year. ""Rising employment and low interest rates are boosting consumer spending, which seems to be the main growth driver,"" Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
Based on the May survey, the German economy is likely to grow by 0.4 percent in the second quarter, Williamson said, adding: ""If June also comes in strong, we're up to 0.5 percent growth.""
The German economy grew by 0.7 percent in the first quarter, more than doubling its growth rate and cementing its role as the euro zone's growth engine, as higher state and household expenditure more than offset a dip in foreign trade.
For 2016 as a whole, the government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 1.7 percent, on a par with last year, when growth was driven mainly by strong private consumption and higher state spending.

The Markit composite purchasing managersâ index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose to a five month high of 54.7 in May from 53.6 in the prior month.
Economists had expected a reading of 53.8.
The German manufacturing PMI rose to 52.4 this month, also a five month high, from a final reading of 51.8 in April, against expectations for an uptick to 52.0.
The services PMI rose to a three month high of 55.2 from 54.5 in the prior month. Economists had expected the index to rise to 54.6.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Manufacturers and service providers both reported stronger growth, but some firms struggled to secure new business orders amid an increasingly challenging demand environment.
Despite the slowdown in new business growth, companies continued to add to their workforce numbers at a solid pace, the report said.
Input prices faced by German private sector companies rose for the first time in five months during May. Moreover, the rate of inflation was the strongest since last July.
âA first look at todayâs survey results is encouraging, as output growth accelerated for the first time in 2016 so far,â Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said."
530,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2016 03:17AM ET</span>","Slumping Japan exports, factory orders add to headaches for PM Abe, BOJ","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell sharply in April and manufacturing activity suffered the fastest contraction since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swept to power in late 2012, providing further evidence that the premier's Abenomics stimulus policy is struggling for traction.
The bleak readings on the health of the world's third-largest economy follow Japan's failure last week to win support from its global counterparts to weaken the strong yen, which Tokyo fears could do further damage to the sputtering economy.
They also add pressure on both Abe and the Bank of Japan to do more to rev up flagging growth, even as economists and global investors worry that central banks may be reaching their limits with radical experiments that have yet to kick-start growth.
Data on Monday showed Japan's exports fell 10.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the fastest decline in three months as a stronger yen and weakness in China and other emerging markets take their toll on the country's shipments.
Imports shrank more than 23 percent, reflecting not only lower commodity prices but stubbornly weak domestic demand that has defied a massive asset-buying program by the BOJ which is now into its fourth year.
The decline was likely exaggerated by a drop in U.S.-bound car exports due to supply-chain disruptions caused by earthquakes in Japan last month, but a firmer yen and lackluster global demand are clouding the outlook for 2016. Some analysts fear the economy could contract this quarter after dodging a return to recession early in the year.
""Drops in U.S.-bound car exports were noise,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Asia and the global economy remain weak. On top of that, yen gains squeeze profits at exporters, causing wages and capital spending to weaken, which would hamper 'Abenomics' aim of creating virtuous growth,"" Minami said.
STRONG YEN PUTS JAPAN IN A BIND
Japanese officials recently threatened to intervene in foreign exchange markets to halt ""disorderly, one-sided"" moves as the yen bolted to 18-month highs, but the United States issued a fresh warning to Tokyo on Saturday against weakening its currency, overshadowing a Group of 7 finance leaders' gathering to discuss how to revive growth. 
Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso, while declining to comment on how a strong yen could affect its policy decisions, said on Monday it was desirable for currency rates to move stably, reflecting economic fundamentals.
""The desirability of exchange-rate stability is widely shared by the Japanese industry,"" he said at a seminar.
The BOJ is widely expected to expand policy again by July, after shocking global markets by moving to negative interest rates earlier this year. Such a move, along with a possible interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, could take some fire out of the yen.
Abe is widely expected to unveil an additional budget this summer, and many analysts expect he will postpone a sales tax increase slated for early next year, though officials have publicly said they will press ahead with the plan barring a massive shock to the economy.
A private business survey on Monday suggested more pain ahead for Japanese manufacturers. The Markit/Nikkei preliminary survey for May showed factory activity shrank for the third straight month while total new orders declined at the sharpest pace in 41 months.
Exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell 7.6 percent in April, while the U.S.-bound shipments fell 11.8 percent year-on-year. Car exports to the United States fell 4.4 percent, down for the first time since November 2014.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's shipments, fell 11.1 percent in the year to April, but EU-bound shipments rose 9.9 percent.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) recently forecast a bigger-than-expected 35 percent tumble in net profit for the current year due to the sharp appreciation of the yen, ending three straight years of record profits driven in part by a weak currency. But it still expected global sales to inch up this year.

The yen was trading around 110 to the dollar  on Monday, pulling back from a high above 105 yen earlier this month, its strongest since late 2014.

Markit said that its seasonally adjusted Flash France Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose from 50.2 in April to 51.1 in May, beating expectations for 50.2.
The preliminary services purchasing managersâ index improved to a seasonally adjusted 51.8 this month, a seven-month high. The reading came in above expectations for 50.6 and up from 50.6 in April.
In contrast, the French manufacturing purchasing managersâ index inched up to a seasonally adjusted 48.3 this month, missing expectations for 48.8 but up from 48.0 a month earlier.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
New business received by private sector firms in France increased for a second successive month in May. Moreover, the rate of growth quickened slightly, reaching a six-month high.
Service providers recorded a further rise in new work, albeit slightly slower than seen in April. Manufacturers continued to report falling new orders, although the rate of decline eased from the 14-month record seen in April.
Commenting on the report, Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit said, ""First-quarter GDP data showed a surprisingly punchy 0.5% expansion, but the PMIs continue to point to a more subdued trend in private sector activity midway through the second quarter.â
EUR/USD was at 1.1238 from around 1.1235 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7737 from 0.7735 earlier.

The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 47.6 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, from a final 48.2 in April.
The index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the third month and showed that activity shrank at the fastest since December 2012.
The index for new orders fell to a preliminary 44.1 from 45.0 in the previous month, also suggesting the fastest decline since December 2012.
The aftermath of earthquakes in southern Japan in April may still be weighing heavily on some producers, a statement from Markit said, while foreign demand also contracted sharply.
Japan escaped a technical recession in the first quarter, gross domestic product data showed last week, but economists warned the underlying trend for consumer spending remains weak.
There are also concerns that companies have already started to delay business investment due to uncertainty about overseas economies.
Speculation is growing that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will delay a nationwide sales tax hike scheduled for next April to focus on measures that will strengthen domestic demand.

Economists also expect the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy even further by July as a strong yen and still-sluggish economy threaten its ability to meet its ambitious inflation target, a Reuters poll showed.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales increased 1.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.45 million units.
March's sales pace was revised slightly higher to 5.36 million units from the previously reported 5.33 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales rising to a 5.40 million-unit pace last month. Sales were up 6.0 percent from a year ago.
However, there were regional variations. Home sales surged in the Midwest by 12.1 percent last month and also rose in the Northeast while the South and West lost steam.

Earlier this week U.S. housing starts also increased more than expected in April as builders ramped up the construction of single- and multi-family homes.
The number of unsold homes on the market rose 9.2 percent to 2.14 million in April from March, but was down 3.6 percent compared to a year ago.
""Housing shortage is still present,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
At April's sales pace, it would take 4.7 months to clear the stock of homes on the market, up from 4.4 months in March. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The share of first-time homebuyers rose to 32 percent from 30 percent last month and a year ago.
Nationwide, the median home price stood at $232,500. That was an increase of 6.3 percent from one year ago.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of residential building permits granted in Germany jumped by nearly a third to over 84,000 in the first three months of 2016, data showed on Friday, boosting expectations that construction will continue to support growth in Europe's largest economy.
The Federal Statistics Office said authorities issued permits for 72,335 new residential buildings and approved construction work at 12,454 existing buildings.
Approvals for the 'hostel residences' sub-category of homes, which also includes shelters for refugees and asylum seekers, more than doubled to 5,149.
The total of 84,789 marked an increase of 31 percent on the year. It was the highest number of approvals granted in a first quarter since 2004, showing that last year's positive trend in the construction sector is extending into 2016.
In 2015, the number of residential building approvals rose to nearly 310,000, the highest in 15 years. Still experts say that at least 350,000 new homes are needed every year until 2020 to tackle a drastic shortage of affordable housing, aggravated by a record influx of refugees.
Even before the refugee numbers started to increase last summer, there was an estimated lack of 800,000 affordable flats in urban areas. With demand outstripping supply, property prices and rents have soared in cities like Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.
In addition, record-low borrowing costs are encouraging many Germans to overcome their traditional aversion to buying their own flats and houses, with some also regarding property as an attractive investment.
Higher spending on social housing and special tax incentives for investors who build flats in urban areas are expected to give the construction sector an additional push this year.
Construction accounts for 4 percent of German gross domestic product (GDP) and, with 2.5 million people working in more than 300,000 companies, it is a major employer.

The booming construction sector is currently one of the main growth drivers in Germany. In the first three months of 2016, construction investment was one of the biggest growth contributors while net foreign trade was a drag.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's consumer prices were expected to fall for a second straight month in April as energy prices dipped, and exports were seen to drop for a seven consecutive month on weak overseas demand and a strong yen, a Reuters poll found. 
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was expected to have fallen 0.4 percent in April from a year ago, the poll of 21 economists showed, accelerating the pace of decline from 0.3 percent in March.
""In addition to energy prices such as gasoline and electricity which have been weighing on consumer prices, the yen's appreciation also pushed down the import price of consumer goods,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, in a report.
""There is a good chance that core CPI will stay in slightly negative territory in the first half of this fiscal year.""
The internal affairs ministry will announce core CPI at 8:30 a.m. on May 27 (2330 GMT May 26).
The poll also found that exports were expected to decline 10.0 percent in April from a year earlier, after a 6.8 percent fall in March.
Imports were believed to have dropped 19.0 percent last month from a year earlier, resulting in a trade surplus of 492.8 billion yen ($4.47 billion).
April could mark a third consecutive month of trade surplus if the outcome is as expected. 
""The trade surplus would be considered largely due to import declines reflecting falling fuel prices,"" Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in the survey. 
The finance ministry will publish the trade data at 8:50 a.m. on May 23 (2350 GMT May 22).

The economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter, thanks in part to a leap year consumption boost, but analysts say the rebound is not strong enough to dispel concerns over a contraction this quarter.

May U.S. new vehicle sales will slide 5.7 percent from the same month a year earlier, in part because of two fewer selling days this year. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate closely followed by the industry will be 17.4 million vehicles for May, down from 17.7 million vehicles a year ago.
In April, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate for sales was 17.4 million vehicles as well.
The consultancies also lowered the full-year 2016 forecast for U.S. new vehicle sales to 17.7 million vehicles from 17.8 million.
âVehicle sales growth appears to be flattening out,"" said Jeff Schuster, head of forecasting for LMC Automotive. ""While this is driven by an array of variables, including slow economic growth and stock market volatility, a pattern is emerging sooner than anticipated. While we do not anticipate a retraction in volume over the next 12-18 months, strong year-over-year growth will be difficult to come by.â

Deirdre Borrego, manager of automotive data at J.D. Power, said there is a chance that Memorial Day weekend sales may be stronger than now anticipated if automakers offer rich marketing incentives to lower prices for consumers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment aid fell from a 14-month high last week, the latest sign the economy was picking up speed in the second quarter and likely would be healthy enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June.
The economic outlook got a further boost from another report on Thursday showing a gauge of future activity jumped in April. The reports followed recent upbeat data on retail sales, home building and industrial production. 
Minutes from the Fed's April 26-27 policy meeting, published on Wednesday, showed most officials considered it appropriate to raise rates next month if data continued to point to an improvement in second-quarter growth.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
""The economy is coming back. This is further ammunition to our view that the Fed will restart the normalization process, either in June or July,"" said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended May 14, the Labor Department said. That was the biggest drop since February and snapped a three-week string of increases. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 63 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
Jobless claims had risen since mid-April, with economists blaming a variety of factors, including the different timing of school spring breaks, which often makes it difficult to adjust the data around this time of the year. 
An ongoing strike by Verizon (N:VZ) workers as well as possible disruptions to manufacturing activity in the wake of recent earthquakes in Japan have also been cited. 
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its leading economic index increased 0.6 percent in April after being unchanged in March. Nearly all of the index's 10 components, with the exception of consumer expectations, contributed to the rebound last month. 
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies after the data. U.S. stocks fell sharply as worries about a June rate hike and a renewed decline in oil prices offset better-than-expected quarterly results from Wal-Mart (N:WMT). Prices for U.S. government debt were trading higher.
MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING
There were large declines last week in unadjusted claims for New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which had seen hefty gains in the prior week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 7,500 to 275,750 last week.
The claims data covered the survey week for May's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims increased 15,000 between the April and May survey periods, suggesting little change in employment gains after the economy added 160,000 jobs last month. 
Economists warned that payrolls could take a hit in May as a result of an ongoing strike at Verizon (N:VZ). The roughly 40,000 striking workers would be considered unemployed as they would not have received a paycheck during the survey period. 
""Striking workers will be considered off payroll for the May jobs report.Â We provisionally estimate that May payroll growth could be held down by around 40,000 by this effect,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
In a third report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index fell to minus 1.8 this month from a reading of minus 1.6 in April. The index, which surged in March, has registered a negative reading in eight of the last nine months.
Details of the survey were mixed, with a measure of new orders contracting after being flat in April. Current shipments, however, rose 10 points and a gauge of inventories increased to a nine-month high. The employment measure improved 15 points this month, but remained negative for a fifth consecutive month.
Manufacturing remains constrained by the delayed pass-through of the U.S. dollar's rally between June 2014 and December 2015, as well as the lingering effects of the oil price plunge and an inventory overhang.
A report on Monday showed factory activity in New York state contracted sharply in May after a sharp acceleration in April.

""Drags on the manufacturing sector could prove longer-lasting than had been suggested by the surveys' sharp improvement in March,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank rate setters agreed in April that they need to defend the bank against a growing number of critics, as its ultra-easy policy came under fire in Germany and elsewhere, minutes of their meeting showed on Thursday.
German banks and savers have complained the ECB's ultra-low interest rates and money-printing were hitting their profits. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble even argued they were partly to blame for the rise of the right-wing anti-immigration party, Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Investor confidence in the ECB has also been waning. Market-based measures of inflation expectations remain near the low level they had reached when the ECB began its asset purchases in January 2015, despite repeated ECB moves to boost the program.
ECB Governing Council members emphasized the need to react to such scepticism and reaffirmed their confidence about the success of their program in bringing inflation back to the ECB's target of almost 2 percent ""in the medium term"".
""There was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation (to the ECB's target),"" the ECB said.
""In light of recent public criticism ... in a Member State, it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate.""
Since then, several ECB policy makers, including President Mario Draghi and the head of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, defended the bank's policy in the German press, saying it was a reaction to rather than a cause of weak economic growth.
The record of the April meeting suggests the rate setters were more optimistic about the economy but remained concerned that low oil prices might undermine wages and other prices. They noted financial markets were not signaling faster inflation even after oil prices rebounded.
""It was considered worrisome that, despite the stabilization in oil prices, market-based inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels,"" the minutes said.
While reiterating they were willing to do more to boost inflation, the ECB rate setters said they would now focus on rolling out the measures announced in March.
They also said the ECB does not ""mechanically"" react to changes in its three-year staff inflation forecast and takes a more flexible approach when assessing the ""medium-term"" outlook.
""In particular, the medium-term horizon should not be equated to the horizon of the staff projections, as outside observers sometimes appeared to do when characterizing the Governing Councilâs reaction function,"" the ECB said.

""In this regard, great care was needed when framing the Governing Councilâs reaction function, also in the context of forward guidance, to avoid conveying the sense that monetary policy was mechanically focused on a specific time horizon.""

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index deteriorated further with a decline of 1.8 this month from Aprilâs reading of -1.6.
Analysts had expected the index to return to expansion by improving to 3.5 in May.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
With regard to future activity in the sector, new orders further deteriorated with a reading of -1.9, compared to the April's flat reading.
The employment index showed a drop of 3.3 in May, which was an improvement when compared to a prior decline of 18.5.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose more than expected in March but companies expect orders to decline in the current quarter as firms become increasingly cautious due to a rising yen and weakness in overseas economies.
The 5.5 percent rise in core orders was more than the median estimate for a 0.5 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts. In February, core orders fell 9.2 percent.
Companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, would fall 3.5 percent in the April-June quarter.
The data suggests companies are starting to delay their investment plans due to uncertainty about the overseas economy and signs that domestic consumer spending is struggling to gain momentum.
""Capital expenditure has entered a period of stagnation,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""The government needs to focus on supply-side measures. The global economy is losing momentum and the yen is stronger than most companies would like it to be right now.""
Japan's companies have strong capital expenditure needs because capital stock is old and industries need to upgrade facilities to make up for a shortage of workers.
Despite this, spending has been weak.
Gross domestic product data for the first quarter this week showed household spending lacked strength and capital expenditure fell, a worrying sign that domestic demand could falter.
In January-March, core orders rose 6.7 percent from the prior three months.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.2 percent in March, more than a median estimate for a 0.8 percent increase.
Policymakers are counting on an increase in capital expenditure to fuel gains in productivity, create new jobs and increase wages.
A weekend gathering of Group of Seven finance leaders may expose a rift on issues ranging from currency and fiscal policies within the close-knit group of advanced economies, dashing Japan's hopes of mustering a coordinated policy response to spur global growth.

570,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2016 11:00PM ET</span>","Australia's labor market resilient, keeps jobless rate low at 5.7 percent ","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's unemployment rate stayed at its lowest in over two years in April as the economy generated nearly 11,000 new jobs, an encouraging outcome highlighting the resilience of the labor market.
Thursday's report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the jobless rate was unchanged at 5.7 percent in April, when the median forecast had been for a rise to 5.8 percent.
The unemployment rate has been around 5.75 percent in recent months, having been as high as 6.25 percent last year.
A total of 10,800 net new jobs were created in April, slightly undershooting forecasts of 12,500. Full time employment fell 9,300, while part-time jobs rose 20,200.
Annual jobs growth was a healthy 2.1 percent.
The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> dropped to a two-and-a-half month low after the mixed jobs data. The Aussie fell as low as $0.7209, from $0.7232 earlier in the day, before bouncing back to where it started the session near $0.7230. A sustained break under $0.7212 would target a major retracement level of $0.7063. While employment growth has slowed from the strong pace of around 2.5 percent in the past two quarters, some leading indicators of employment have been encouraging.
A closely watched survey by the National Australia Bank earlier this month showed businesses' hiring intentions stayed above their long-run averages in April, suggesting ongoing resilience in the labor market.
Underpinning labor demand has been slow wage growth, which reduces cost pressures for businesses.
Government figures on Wednesday showed wages grew at their slowest pace on record last quarter with a mere 0.4 percent increase. That took the annual rate down to 2.1 percent, a record low as well.

576,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2016 04:32PM ET</span>",Fed signals interest rate hike firmly on the table for June,"By Jason Lange and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials felt the U.S. economy could be ready for another interest rate increase in June, according to the minutes from the central bank's April policy meeting released on Wednesday.
Most participants in the policy-setting committee's April 26-27 meeting said they wanted to see signs that economic growth was picking up in the second quarter and that employment and inflation were firming, the minutes showed.
""Then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" according to the minutes.
The suggestion that a rate increase in June is firmly on the table suggests the Fed is closer to tightening monetary policy again than Wall Street had expected. The Fed lifted rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Prices for futures contracts on the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate implied that investors saw a 34 percent chance of a rate increase next month, up from 19 percent shortly before the release of the minutes, according to CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
U.S. stocks fell and the dollar (DXY) extended gains against a basket of currencies after the minutes were released. Treasury yields rose, with the yield on 30-year U.S. government debt rising to a two-week high.
""They are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.
ROBUST JOB GROWTH
Recent data has made policymakers more confident that inflation is rising toward the Fed's 2 percent target and they also expressed fewer concerns about a global economic slowdown, according to the minutes.
Some policymakers at the meeting were worried about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, when gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 0.5 percent, a two-year low.
But others argued that ongoing robust job growth suggested the economy had not gone off the track and that the growth data could be flawed.
""Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated,"" according to the minutes.
Data since the end of April has pointed to a pickup in consumer spending and manufacturing output, bolstering the view that economic growth was accelerating after stalling in the first quarter. Several Fed officials in recent weeks have stressed that a rate increase might be warranted in June.
Some policymakers at the April meeting said they were concerned financial markets could be roiled by a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote next month or by China's exchange rate policies.
The Fed last month kept its target overnight interest rate in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent.
A global equities sell-off and the tightening of financial markets earlier this year largely due to concerns of a slowdown in China prompted the Fed in March to dial back rate increase expectations for the year.

Even so, the Fed signaled at that time that it would likely lift rates twice this year. Investors have been betting on just one hike.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's labor market mostly withstood the uncertainty around June's European Union membership referendum in the first quarter, as the employment rate increased and the number of jobless edged lower.
The number of unemployed fell by 2,000 in the three months to March, the Office for National Statistics said, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.1 percent as expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The number of people in work rose by 44,000 in the first quarter of this year, taking the employment rate to a record high of 74.2 percent. But the pace of hiring slowed from 195,00 in the last three months of 2015.
Britain's economy slowed in the first quarter, and recent data suggested it could lose further momentum as uncertainty around the June 23 vote takes a toll on consumers and investors.
""With or without the EU referendum, a slower rate of job gains seemed likely but the actual outturn was by no means as bad as many feared,"" said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC.
""Ahead of the EU referendum, it is very difficult for either us or the (Bank of England) to take a firm view on the extent to which hiring activity has been affected by the uncertainty of the outcome which ... means the near-term implication for policy is very limited.""
The BoE has said the most recent weakness in data reflects the forthcoming vote, but has also said it would treat economic data around the vote with caution.
The number of people making jobless claims fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800 but was revised sharply higher in March. The claimant count rose by 14,700 in March - the biggest increase since September 2011.
SLUGGISH WAGE GROWTH
Wages largely lagged the broader economic recovery in recent years, and now that the economy was slowing, that weakness was likely to persist, analysts said.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2 percent and against expectations for a 2.3 percent rise.
""There are plenty of reasons for companies to be taking a cautious stance on pay deals at the moment, particularly with a more fragile growth outlook and political uncertainty on the horizon,"" Lee Hopley, EEF chief economist said.
A survey by the industry group showed pay increases in the manufacturing sector, which has been struggling of late, averaged 1.7 percent in the three months to April, down from 1.8 percent in the three months to March.
The BoE is watching for signs of stronger pay growth as it considers when to raise rates from their record low, which economists expect will only happen next year.
The ONS said there was no anecdotal evidence that the vote on Brexit and that the introduction of a higher minimum wage in April had affected the data. 

Private industry surveys have pointed to falling jobs vacancies and suggest employers have favored temporary staff over permanent staff as the referendum nears.

Financial data company Markit said its Household Finance Index for May fell to a 22-month low of 42.3 from 45.1 in April, though it was above the average reading of 39.9 recorded since the survey started in early 2009.
""In a period of heightened uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum, Markit's HFI survey pointed to a marked financial squeeze in May, but households' expectations for the year ahead were little-changed since April,"" Markit economist Philip Leake said.
The measure of current inflation perceptions touched a 17-month high. Markit's survey was conducted before the release of official data that showed inflation receded last month after hitting its highest level since December 2014 in March.
Households reported only a marginal rate of pay growth, and Markit said there was little expectation that the Bank of England would raise interest rates from their record low 0.5 percent soon.
The proportion of households forecasting a rate hike in the next six months dropped to 22 percent, well below the survey average and down from 25 percent in April.
""With near-term economic prospects far from certain, the majority of households do not envisage monetary policy tightening any time soon,"" Leake said. 

The BoE has said economic indicators are likely to be hard to interpret in the run-up to the June 23 referendum on Britain's European Union membership, which opinion polls show are too close to call.

The claimant count fell by a seasonally adjusted 2,400 in April, compared to expectations for a increase of 4,300 people, and following an advance of 14,700 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported gain of 6.700.
The upward revision in the claimant count was the biggest monthly rise since September 2011.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.0% in the three months to March, above forecasts for a 1.7% increase and after increasing by 1.8% in the three months to February.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.1%, below forecasts for a 2.3% increase and following a 2.2% increase in the three months to February.
Following the report, GBP/USD traded at 1.4430 from around 1.4435 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7808 from 0.7802 earlier.

586,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2016 04:16AM ET</span>","Japan's economy dodges recession in first-quarter, sales tax decision eyed","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter, thanks in part to a leap year consumption boost, but analysts say the rebound is not strong enough to dispel concerns over a contraction this quarter.
With private consumption making only a feeble recovery from last quarter's slump, the data keeps alive market expectations that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will delay a scheduled sales tax hike next year, analysts said.
The world's third-largest economy expanded by an annualized 1.7 percent in January-March, much more than a median market forecast for a 0.2 percent increase and rebounding from a 1.7 percent contraction in the previous quarter, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
Analysts had worried that the January-March period would not produce enough growth to avert recession - defined as two straight quarters of contraction - after stripping out the estimated boost from the leap year.
""Taking into account the effects of the extra day from the leap year, which pushed up the quarter-on-quarter growth rate by 0.3 percentage point, growth is not as strong as the headline number shows,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The GDP data will likely press Abe to decide to delay a planned sales tax hike next year and to roll out additional fiscal stimulus worth at least 5 trillion yen ($45.76 billion). I also expect the Bank of Japan to ease policy further in July given weak growth and tame inflation.""
Following the data, Koichi Hamada, an emeritus professor of economics at Yale University and key economic adviser to Abe, reiterated his opposition to the planned tax hike, which he told lawmakers would cause ""quite a confusion"".
Abe said there was no change to his plan to proceed with the tax increase, unless Japan is hit by a huge earthquake or a shock of the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
But he acknowledged that private consumption was weaker than expected since it was hit by the first tax hike in 2014.
WEAK CONSUMPTION
Private consumption, which makes up 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.5 percent, more than double the median market forecast, as households boosted spending on televisions, food and beverage, and recreation, the data showed. But the rebound failed to make up for a 0.8 percent drop the previous quarter.
Government officials have said the data will be crucial in Abe's decision on whether to postpone a sales tax hike scheduled for next year.
The data also comes ahead of a Group of Seven leaders' summit Abe will host in western Japan next week, where he hopes to foster agreement on the need for global coordination of policies to jump-start growth.
Japan's economy contracted in the final quarter of last year as slow wage growth hurt private consumption, while exports felt the pinch from sluggish emerging market demand and the pain of a strong yen.
Abe raised the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent in 2014, which tipped the economy into recession. That led Abe to delay a second tax hike to 10 percent by 18 months.

The rise in the first quarter GDP was the first growth in two quarters following a 0.4% fall on quarter, or an annualized 1.7% drop in the final quarter of 2015 (revised down from -0.3% and -1.1%).
""The U.S. corporate sector is weak. China has excess capacity and other structural issues which are not transparent. We expect some growth but downside risks have been growing since last summer,"" said a senior Cabinet Office economist.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 60% of the GDP, rose 0.5% on quarter, the first rise in two quarters.
The GDP data showed employee compensation rose a real 1.3% on quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis in January-March, up from a revised 0.5% gain in October-December.
Still, as noted, the the economy is expected to remain sluggish in the April-June quarter as neither consumption nor capex has shown signs of a quick recovery.
Speaking later, Japan's economy will stay on a ""modest recovery"" track on improving job offers and incomes, Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara saidWednesday.
The government will push ahead with policy measures to overcome deflation and revive the economy by implementing fiscal programs in the budget earlier than scheduled, Ishihara said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in more than three years in April as gasoline and rents rose, pointing to a steady inflation build-up that could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to raise interest rates later this year.
Other data on Tuesday showed housing starts and industrial production rebounded strongly last month, suggesting the economy was regaining steam early in the second quarter after almost stalling early in the year.
""The combination of higher prices, housing gains and industrial production support the narrative of a second-quarter rebound in GDP, and will stir talks of the necessity of at least one Fed hike later this year,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since February 2013, after rising 0.1 percent in March. That took the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in March. 
Americans also paid more for medical care, food, recreation, tobacco, motor vehicle insurance, airline fares and grooming. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3 percent last month and advancing 1.1 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent after increasing 2.2 percent in March. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.6 percent. The rise in prices in April is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who have persistently expressed concerns about inflation running below its target.
""Inflation pressures are picking up, I don't think there is any need for the Fed to panic. They don't need to hit their inflation target and declare victory,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania."" 
""They need to allow inflation to run hot for a little bit.""
The dollar initially rose against a basket of currencies after the data, but gave up gains and was trading lower. U.S stocks fell, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose. 
GROWTH PICKING UP
Financial markets have almost priced out a rate hike before September, given sluggish growth at the beginning of the year. The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers have forecast two more increases this year.
The are signs, however, the economy got off to a strong start in the second quarter. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 6.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units last month, with builders ramping up the construction of single- and multi-family homes. Building permits rose 3.6 percent to a 1.12 million-unit rate.
The improving outlook was underscored by a third report from the Fed showing industrial production increased 0.7 percent in April after two straight months of declines as a 5.8 percent surge in utilities output offset another decline in mining.
Manufacturing production rose 0.3 percent, with machinery and motor vehicles and parts output increasing solidly.
Mining output fell 2.3 percent as it continues to be undermined by the delayed pass-through of the oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015, which has caused a sharp reduction in capital spending by energy firms.
Mining output has decreased more than 1-1/2 percent per month, on average, over the past eight months.
While Tuesday's data added to strong retail sales numbers in suggesting that economic growth regained steam early in the second quarter, a slowdown in payrolls gains last month and a recent spike in new applications for unemployment benefits have raised some concerns about the labor market's health.
The inflation report showed gasoline prices jumped 8.1 percent last month, the largest gain since August 2012, adding to March's 2.2 percent increase. Food prices rose 0.2 percent after falling 0.2 percent in March. 
Within the core CPI basket, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in March. Medical care costs increased 0.3 percent after gaining 0.1 percent in March. Prescription drugs shot up 0.7 percent and the cost of hospital services increased 0.3 percent. 
But apparel prices fell for a second straight month as did the cost of used cars and trucks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory output expanded in April as makers of machinery and cars posted solid increases in production, a sign that the country's manufacturing sector was resisting the downward pull from sputtering global growth.
Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. The reading matched the gain expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
Overall industrial output rose 0.7 percent last month, beating the consensus forecast of a 0.3 percent gain, as utilities output rebounded from March when it was restrained by warmer-than-usual weather.
Mining output, another component of total industrial production, fell 2.3 percent in April.
The gain in factory output, coming after recent strong retail sales data, bolsters the view that the U.S. economy could re-accelerate in the second quarter after growing sluggishly in the first three months of the year.
The industrial sector has been undermined by a slowing global economy and robust dollar, which have eroded demand for U.S. manufactured goods. Manufacturing output has been flat or negative in four of the last six months.
But there are signs the worst of the industrial sector's downturn is over, with recent manufacturing surveys turning higher. In addition, the dollar's rally has fizzled and oil prices appear to be stabilizing.
Last month, production of long-lasting manufactured goods increased 0.6 percent. The largest gains in manufacturing came from producers of machinery, who increased output by 2.4 percent. Production of motor vehicles and auto parts increased 1.3 percent.
With output increasing last month, industrial capacity use jumped 0.5 percentage point to 75.4 percent.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.

From a year earlier, the economy likely grew 6.6 percent in the first quarter, faster than the previous quarter's 6.3 percent expansion, buoyed by a burst of campaign spending in the run-up to the May 9 presidential election.

608,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",UK April inflation slips for first time since September as airfares fall,"LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slipped in April for the first time since September last year, reflecting a drop in airfares after a March surge around the Easter holidays disappeared, as well as lower clothing prices.
Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said, in line with a Bank of England estimate last week but below economists' expectation for inflation to remain at 0.5 percent.
British inflation has been below the BoE's 2 percent target for more than two years and last year it was zero, the lowest since comparable records began in 1950.
The BoE forecast inflation would stay below 1 percent until the tail end of this year and to undershoot its target until 2018, due to the global slump in oil prices, the effect of past rises in sterling and lackluster wage growth.
Separate ONS figures also released on Tuesday confirmed industry surveys showing a big increase in house prices in the run-up to an extra property purchase tax which took effect in April.
The ONS said house prices in Britain were 9.0 percent higher than a year earlier, the biggest rise in a year. In London - where the new tax will have the biggest effect - prices rose by 13.0 percent.
As well as the drop in airfares, lower prices for women's clothing and a government-mandated reduction in the rents charged for social housing pushed down inflation last month.
An ONS measure of core consumer price inflation -- which strips out changes in the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco -- fell to 1.2 percent, compared with economists' expectations for 1.4 percent.
But the dip in consumer price inflation is likely to be short-lived.
Prices charged by manufacturers, which tend to be responsive to changes in energy and raw material prices, fell last month at the slowest annual rate since November 2014.
North Sea oil prices (LCOc1) rose 22 percent last month and have recovered further in May, hitting a six-month high on Monday after slumping around 35 percent in dollar terms in 2015.
Fears that a weakening global economy and sharp stock market falls might sap the strength of Britain's moderate domestic recovery mean few economists expect the BoE to raise rates before early next year.
Many in financial markets think it could take much longer, and see a small chance that the BoE could instead be forced to cut rates below the record-low 0.5 percent where they have languished for almost seven years - especially if Britons vote to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum.
Expectations among people in Britain for inflation over the coming year rose in April to their highest level since July of last year, according to a YouGov survey published at the end of April.
Two surveys last week suggested British shoppers held off from buying new spring and summer clothes during an unusually cold April, compounding a sense of uncertainty among consumers ahead of the EU referendum.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, below forecasts for it to remain stable at the 0.5% increase seen in March, which had been the highest level since December 2014.
The ONS noted that main contributors to the decline in inflation were drops in air fares and prices for clothing vehicles and social housing rent.
âThese downward pressures were partially offset by rising prices for motor fuels and for certain recreational goods and cultural services, and by food prices, which were unchanged between March and April 2016, having fallen between the same two months a year ago,â the ONS said.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.1% in April, also below forecasts for an advance of 0.3% and following a gain of 0.4% in the prior month.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will now have to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, as inflation is more than a percentage point below the central bank's target of 2.0%.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.2% last month, below forecasts that were looking for it to remain stable at the gain of 1.5% seen in March.
The retail price index increased 1.3% in April, below expectations for it to advance 1.5% and Marchâs reading of 1.6%.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 9.0% in April, above forecasts for a gain of 7.9% and following a 7.6% increase in March.
In an immediate reaction, the pound weakened. GBP/USD traded at 1.4479 from around 1.4494 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7824 from 0.7818 earlier.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank members discussed leaving interest rates on hold earlier this month, but decided in the end that a cut would help return inflation to target over time.
Investors were quick to temper expectations for a follow-up policy easing in the near term and sent the Australian dollar up more than half a U.S. cent to a session high of $0.7368 <AUD=D4>.
""On balance, members were persuaded that prospects for sustainable growth in the economy, with inflation returning to target over time, would be improved by easing monetary policy at this meeting,"" minutes of the May 3 policy review revealed.
At that meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reduced the cash rate by a quarter point to a record low 1.75 percent.
Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at RBC said the minutes confirmed the decision to cut rates was a ""line-ball call.""
""The market will derive from this that another cut near term is unlikely. But we're not sure that is the right conclusion.""
The minutes showed the central bank was mostly concerned about surprisingly soft inflation last quarter.
""Although the March quarter outcome for the CPI reflected some temporary factors, the broad-based softness in prices and labor costs signaled less momentum in domestic inflationary pressures than had previously been expected,"" the minutes said.
The RBA noted there had been no material change in its outlook for growth and was still of the view that the economy was continuing to rebalance away from the mining sector, thanks to ""very accommodative"" monetary policy and a lower exchange rate since 2013.
The minutes gave little away on whether the RBA would cut rates again.
In its quarterly monetary policy report published a few days after the rate decision, the RBA slashed its 2016 underlying inflation forecasts to below its target band of 2 to 3 percent, prompting investors to bet on at least one more cut in interest rates this year.
In the wake of the minutes, interbank futures <0#YIB:> trimmed chances of a near-term move in rates with markets now giving a 60 percent chance of a cut by August, down from 76 percent.
The minutes appear to support the view that the RBA only ever intended to cut rates once and it was just deliberating the timing, said Paul Dales, Australia & New Zealand economist at Capital Economics.
""We disagree and believe that rates will be cut to 1.5 percent at the August meeting.""

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion of the Australian economy by discussing the March quarter consumer price index (CPI). They noted that inflation had been lower than expected. Various measures suggested that underlying inflation had declined to a little less than Â¼ per cent, compared with about Â½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 1Â½ per cent over the year. Headline inflation had been lower still, partly reflecting a decline in fuel prices in the March quarter and over the year. Even so, the CPI data had indicated that weakness in domestic cost pressures had been broadly based. Non-tradables inflation had declined further in March to around its lowest year-ended rate since the late 1990s, reflecting low growth in labour costs and a range of other factors, including heightened retail competition, a moderation in conditions in housing rental and construction markets, and declines in the cost of business inputs such as fuel and utilities. The exchange rate depreciation over the preceding few years had continued to place some upward pressure on the prices of tradable items, although low wage growth and heightened retail competition appeared to have limited the extent to which higher import prices had become evident in retail prices. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed in the March quarter.Members discussed the extent to which the CPI data provided a signal about ongoing inflation trends. They noted that CPI data were less subject to measurement error than many other key data series. Moreover, the lower-than-expected CPI outcome could not be explained entirely by temporary factors and in fact was significantly driven by low price rises for non-tradable items. That in turn was consistent with a range of data suggesting quite subdued growth in labour costs (which had also been a bit weaker over 2015 than previously expected).In their consideration of the outlook, members noted that the staff forecasts for inflation had been lowered. The forecasts embodied the expectation that growth in the wage price index would stabilise around current quarterly growth rates before gradually picking up later in the forecast period. This pick-up was consistent with the outlook for output growth and expected improvements in labour market conditions. In addition, information from the Bank's business liaison suggested that firms generally had been unwilling to make offers of wage growth below 2 per cent. But if inflation was to be persistently lower than previously forecast, it was possible that, in time, this could be reflected in lower wage growth.Members noted that wage growth had also been low in many advanced economies, even in cases where labour market conditions had become quite tight. This suggested that some of the factors that might explain these outcomes, such as heightened job insecurity, may be relevant to the current Australian experience. On the other hand, given the apparent flexibility of the Australian labour market over recent years, members noted the possibility that labour cost growth could pick up sooner or by more than expected as labour market conditions improved.Employment growth had slowed in the first quarter of 2016, although members noted that it had remained stronger than population growth over the past year. Leading indicators of employment had been somewhat mixed: job vacancies reported by businesses had continued to rise, while job advertisements had been broadly flat over recent months. These indicators, along with the outlook for output growth, suggested that employment would continue to grow, but at a somewhat slower pace than had been evident over the previous year. The unemployment rate had been around 5Â¾ per cent in recent months and was expected to remain around this level over the next year or so before gradually declining over the forecast period, as output growth increased. The outlook for the unemployment rate was broadly in line with the forecasts presented three months earlier and consistent with spare capacity remaining in the labour market throughout the forecast period.Members noted that there had been no material change to the forecasts for growth in the Australian economy, although the unexpected strength recorded in the latter part of 2015 had led to an upward revision to year-ended GDP growth in the near term. The effects of low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013 were expected to lead to a gradual strengthening of growth to an above-trend rate and help a further rebalancing of activity towards the non-resources sectors of the economy.Growth in household consumption had increased in the second half of 2015. While the pace of growth in retail sales volumes looked to have been maintained early in 2016, other timely indicators of consumption had eased a little in recent months. Information from the Bank's liaison with retailers suggested some moderation in trading conditions in 2016, although conditions had remained generally positive. Households' perceptions of their own finances had declined to around average levels in April, after being above average for most of the past year or so. However, these indicators provided only a rough guide to quarterly growth in consumption, which was forecast to be slightly above average even though real household disposable income had been revised lower, consistent with revisions to wage growth. As a result, the household saving ratio was expected to continue to decline gradually.The amount of residential construction work still in the pipeline was substantial and had increased further of late. This pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a gradually declining rate consistent with the decline in building approvals over the previous year. Conditions in established housing markets had stabilised over the past six months or so. Housing prices had grown moderately over 2016, following a small decline at the end of 2015. Housing credit growth had eased a little to around 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms in early 2016. This had followed increases in mortgage rates and the strengthening of banks' non-price lending terms in response to supervisory actions.Surveyed conditions in the business sector had remained above average and growth in business credit had increased over the past year or so. Indicators of investment intentions remained weak; for instance, the stock of private non-residential work yet to be done had fallen further in the December quarter, in line with subdued levels of non-residential building approvals. This suggested that non-mining business investment was likely to remain subdued for a time, although it was forecast gradually to pick up later in the forecast period as overall demand strengthened further. Mining investment was expected to continue to fall as projects were progressively completed, although the magnitude of the falls was expected to diminish over the next couple of years, consistent with the forecasts presented in the February Statement on Monetary Policy. Members noted that the recent rally in commodity prices was not expected to boost mining investment over the next couple of years. Project completions were expected to support further growth in resource exports, particularly iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The contribution of net service exports to growth was expected to continue to be positive given the exchange rate depreciation since 2013.
International Economic Conditions
Recent data indicated that growth in Australia's major trading partners had eased around the turn of the year to be somewhat below its decade average in the early part of 2016. The outlook for growth in major trading partners in 2016 and 2017 had been revised a little lower since the February Statement on Monetary Policy to reflect these data as well as some reassessment of the momentum of growth, particularly in Asia. Growth in major trading partners was expected to be supported by accommodative monetary policies, while fiscal policies were expected to be less of a drag on growth in the major advanced economies. Core inflation had increased in many advanced economies since mid 2015, but members noted that inflation had remained low globally and was lower than central banks' targets in most economies.Growth in the Chinese economy had moderated further in the March quarter. Subdued investment in the manufacturing sector had been offset to some extent by rising public infrastructure investment and renewed growth in real estate investment. The latter was consistent with strength in the Chinese residential property market following earlier government measures designed to stimulate demand. Chinese trade volumes had declined further, which had had flow-on effects to other Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions with strong trade links to China. There had been some indications that slowing employment growth in the high-income economies of east Asia might lead to a slowing in consumption growth in these economies.The outlook for the Chinese economy had continued to be a key issue. Despite the moderation in growth in the March quarter, the outlook there was similar to that forecast previously, based on the expectation of further support being provided from more stimulatory policy settings. The Chinese authorities appeared, at present, to be giving greater priority to short-term growth objectives over longer-term goals of deleveraging and encouraging growth that was less reliant on investment and heavy industry. However, members noted that the pursuit of near-term growth targets was likely to increase the already elevated levels of debt and could delay addressing the problem of excess capacity in the manufacturing and resources sectors. Therefore, these actions might adversely affect financial stability and the economic outlook in China more broadly in the medium term.The available data suggested that growth in the United States had eased in the first quarter, partly owing to weakness in private investment in the oil sector. Other components of US domestic demand had been more resilient, supported by very expansionary monetary policy, strong employment growth and increasing household wealth. In contrast, Japanese GDP was likely to have remained little changed in the March quarter. The euro area economy had continued to grow at an above-trend pace, driven by domestic demand.Although labour markets had shown further improvement across most advanced economies, wage growth had thus far remained subdued. There had been signs of labour cost pressures building and core inflation increasing in the United States and the United Kingdom, where unemployment rates were close to levels typically associated with a pick-up in inflationary pressures. But wage growth had moderated in Japan, despite the unemployment rate being around a 20-year low. Members noted that there was significant uncertainty about the timing and extent of the pick-up in wage growth and inflation that could be expected as labour markets tightened further in the advanced economies. Any changes in expectations about inflationary pressures would have implications for the expected path of monetary policy and consequently exchange rates, which continued to be an important source of uncertainty in the forecasts.Despite the moderation in major trading partner growth in early 2016, members noted that there had been a further sizeable increase in commodity prices, particularly for iron ore, coking coal and oil. The rise in the prices of bulk commodities had followed the announcement of China's 2016 target for output growth and an expectation that this would be achieved through more stimulatory policy settings. The price of iron ore had increased by 80 per cent from its low point at the end of 2015, but was still only around one-third of its peak level five years earlier. The forecasts assumed that these higher prices of bulk commodities would not be sustained. Demand for steel in China was still expected to decline over the next couple of years and a substantial amount of new, low-cost iron ore supply was likely to enter the market over that period. The price of oil had increased by around 70 per cent since recent lows and this had occurred alongside ongoing speculation about potential caps to OPEC production and signs that oil production in the United States was likely to decline. This had led to an upward revision to LNG prices. The net result of these various movements was that Australia's terms of trade would be slightly higher than previously expected in the near term and were assumed to remain close to recent levels â which were 35 per cent below the recent peak â over the forecast period.
Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that sentiment had continued to improve.Looking at monetary policy settings of the major central banks, members noted that the Bank of Japan had not changed policy at its meeting in the preceding week, notwithstanding market expectations that policy would be eased further. The yen had appreciated sharply following the announcement and was around 12 per cent higher against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates at the end of January. Participants in Japanese financial markets were continuing to adjust to the new regime of negative interest rates amid occasional signs of market dysfunction.The US Federal Reserve's policy settings were left unchanged at the April meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, as had been expected by market participants. Market pricing implied that there would be, at most, one 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate during 2016. The European Central Bank had also left its policy settings unchanged in April.Sovereign bond yields, including in Australia, were little changed in April. In most of the major markets, bond yields had remained close to historic lows.Members noted that the finances of the Greek Government were likely to come under greater scrutiny in the period ahead. With sizeable debt repayments due around the middle of the year, the Greek Government was negotiating with its official sector creditors about new funding. In contrast, Argentina had issued its first bond since the default in 2001, having reached agreement with its holdout creditors.In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to depreciate gradually, with a cumulative depreciation of about 6 per cent since mid January. The Chinese renminbi had also continued to edge lower; the effective exchange rate had depreciated partly because of the appreciation of the yen, which has a significant weight in China's trade-weighted basket. Members noted there was evidence that capital outflows from China had abated in recent months. The Australian dollar appreciated during the first part of the month following the rise in commodity prices, before depreciating sharply following the release of the March quarter CPI data.Higher commodity prices â in particular, the increase in oil prices â had boosted global equity markets, with many equity markets recovering their losses from earlier in the year. A notable exception was Japan, where the market was more than 15 per cent lower. In the Australian market, there had been large rises in the share prices of resource companies over the past month.Bond issuance by the Australian banks thus far in 2016 had been towards the upper end of the range for recent years in both gross and net terms, but wholesale debt costs had not increased significantly overall.In the domestic market, following the release of the CPI, expectations of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting had increased sharply to be around a 50-50 proposition.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the recent data on inflation and labour costs had been lower than expected at the time of the February Statement on Monetary Policy. Although the March quarter outcome for the CPI reflected some temporary factors, the broad-based softness in prices and labour costs signalled less momentum in domestic inflationary pressures than had previously been expected. As a result, there had been a downward revision to the inflation outlook and the profile for wage growth. Underlying inflation was expected to remain around 1â2 per cent over 2016 and to pick up to 1Â½â2Â½ per cent by mid 2018.The recent data suggested that growth in Australia's major trading partners was likely to be a little softer than previously expected and below its decade average in 2016 and 2017. While growth in the Chinese economy had continued to slow, the growth outlook had remained much as previously forecast based on the expectation of further support being provided by more stimulatory policy settings. The renewed focus of the Chinese authorities on the short-term growth targets had been accompanied by a strong rally in bulk commodity prices over recent months. Higher commodity prices would typically support incomes and activity in Australia. However, the rally in commodity prices was not expected to boost mining investment over the next couple of years.Sentiment in financial markets had improved following a period of heightened volatility earlier in the year. Despite uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy settings among the major jurisdictions, funding costs for high-quality borrowers remained very low and, globally, monetary policy was remarkably accommodative.Domestically, the outlook for economic activity and unemployment had been little changed from that presented three months earlier. The available data suggested that the economy had continued to rebalance following the mining investment boom, supported by very accommodative monetary policy and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013, which had helped the traded sector. GDP growth overall had been a bit stronger than expected over 2015, but appeared to have been sustained at a more moderate pace since then. Growth was forecast to pick up gradually to be above estimates of potential growth later in the forecast period. Accordingly, the unemployment rate was expected to remain around current levels for a time before declining gradually as GDP growth picked up. The exchange rate depreciation since early 2013 was assisting with growth and the economic adjustment process, although an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.In coming to their policy decision, members noted that developments over recent months had not led to a material change in the outlook for economic activity or the unemployment rate, but the outlook for inflation had been revised lower. At the same time, they took careful note of developments in the housing market, which indicated that supervisory measures were strengthening lending standards and that the potential risks of lowering interest rates therefore were less than they had been a year earlier.Members discussed the merits of adjusting policy at this meeting or awaiting further information before acting. On balance, members were persuaded that prospects for sustainable growth in the economy, with inflation returning to target over time, would be improved by easing monetary policy at this meeting.
The Decision
The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 per cent, effective 4 May.

The continued decline in oil prices along with sluggish U.S. economic data have pushed back or reduced expectations for a rate hike this year, prompting investors to buy U.S. Treasuries in a world where most sovereign bonds had negative yields.
Overseas investors bought $23.6 billion in U.S. Treasury debt in March, after purchasing $9.9 billion in February, according to the U.S. capital flows data report. March's U.S. Treasury bond inflows were the largest since November last year.
Benchmark interest rates at the beginning of March were 1.8350 percent. By the end of the month, U.S. 10-year yields had declined as low as 1.7690 percent.
Private overseas investors continued their binge of U.S. Treasuries, amassing $41.6 billion in March, after purchases of $60.2 billion the previous month. Over the last five months, private investors have bought nearly $160 billion in U.S. government debt.
The report also showed for the first time U.S. Treasury holdings of Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries. Saudi Arabia has the largest Treasury holdings among the Gulf oil exporters with $116.8 billion. United Arab Emirates was second largest holder of U.S. Treasuries with $62.5 billion in March, while Kuwait has $31.2 billion.
China remains the largest holder of U.S. government debt, although its holdings in March declined to $1.244 trillion, from $1.252 trillion in February.
Japan, the second-largest U.S. Treasury debt holder, posted higher U.S. government debt holdings of $1.137 trillion from $1.133 trillion in February. It was Japan's third increase in U.S. Treasury holdings in five months.
Overall, foreign central bank holdings of U.S. Treasuries grew to $6.287 trillion in March, from $6.236 trillion in February.
Data also showed offshore investors purchased $78.1 billion in long-term U.S assets after buying $72.6 billion the previous month. Including shorter-dated securities, however, overseas investors sold $98.3 billion in March, after buying $31.7 billion in February.
U.S. stocks showed outflows for a second straight month, with foreigners selling $16.5 billion in March, from $11.1 billion outflows in February. Foreigners sold U.S. equities in seven of the last eight months.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's investment, factory output and retail sales all grew more slowly than expected in April, adding to doubts about whether the world's second-largest economy is stabilizing.
Growth in factory output cooled to 6 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Saturday, disappointing analysts who expected it to rise to 6.5 percent on an annual basis after an increase of 6.8 percent the prior month.
China's fixed-asset investment growth eased to 10.5 percent year-on-year in the January-April period, missing market expectations of 10.9 percent, and down from the first quarter's 10.7 percent.
Fixed investment by private firms continued to slow, indicating private businesses remain skeptical of economic prospects. Investment by private firms rose 5.2 percent year-on-year in January-April, down from 5.7 percent growth in the first quarter.
Reuters reported on Saturday that China's banking regulator has sent an urgent notice to banks telling them to clear bottlenecks holding back lending to private firms.
In its data announcement, the NBS said ""Because the total amount of private investment is relatively large, the continued slowdown could restrain stable growth, and requires a high degree of attention.""
MARCH DATA SPARKED HOPE
Retail sales growth in April, which captures both private and government purchasing, slowed to 10.1 percent. Analysts forecast sales would rise 10.5 percent on an annual basis after gaining 10.5 percent the prior month.
Upbeat March data had sparked hopes that China's economy was picking up after more than a year long blitz of fiscal, monetary and administrative stimulus measures. A recovering property market has also boosted demand for raw materials, giving a boost to long ailing heavy industries such as steel mills.
But much of the data on April, which included weaker-than-expected exports and imports, and soft factory activity surveys continued to underline lingering weakness in the broader economy.
China's economic growth has cooled to 25-year lows, weighed down by a combination of weak demand at home and abroad, factory overcapacity and increasing amounts of debt.
The government has made reducing the capacity glut one of its top priorities, and has vowed to put ""zombie"" companies out of business. But economists expect authorities to move slowly to avoid a sharp jump in unemployment.
Recently, the Chinese cabinet called for an upgrade of the consumer products sector in order to boost consumption, by improving product quality and implementing regulations to ensure market access and streamline approvals.

Retail sales surged 1.3 percent in April, the largest gain since March 2015, after dropping 0.3 percent the prior month. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales shot up 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in March.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Core retail sales were previously reported to have gained 0.1 percent in March. Economists had forecast retail sales rising 0.8 percent and core retail sales gaining 0.3 percent last month.
Though the signs of an acceleration in consumer spending will be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials, they are probably insufficient for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates next month as inflation remains tame.
A second report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index climbed 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the PPI was unchanged after dipping 0.1 percent in March.
Inflation continues to be restrained by the lingering effects of the dollar's surge and oil price plunge.
""Today's data materially strengthen the hand of those within the Fed for a rate increase in June but we remain doubtful as to whether this view will prevail, barring an especially robust employment report in early June,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
The dollar rose to a two-week high against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt were trading higher, while stocks on Wall Street fell marginally.
UPBEAT CONSUMERS
Prospects for consumer spending got a boost from a third report showing sentiment among households jumped to an 11-month high in early May, driven by steadily rising incomes, better employment prospects and low inflation.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index surged 6.8 points to 95.8 early this month, the highest reading since June. Sentiment increased among all income and age groups, with big gains among lower-income and younger households.
As a result of last month's strong core retail sales increase, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2.8 percent annualized rate from 2.2 percent.
Economic growth braked to a 0.5 percent pace in the first three months of 2016 after expanding at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
But data on construction spending and factory orders, as well as a fourth report on business inventories from the Commerce Department on Friday, suggested the first-quarter GDP growth estimate would be raised to a 1.2 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month.
Retail sales have been sluggish in part because the firming labor market has not generated strong wage growth. Some of the savings from cheaper gasoline over the past year-and-a-half have been absorbed by rising rents and medical care costs.
Macy's, the largest department chain, said this week same-store sales fell 5.6 percent in the first quarter, and it expected full-year sales to decline 3-4 percent.
Nordstrom reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It cut its profit forecast for the year to $2.50-$2.70 per share from $3.10-$3.35.
""Today's report raised some eyebrows given the string of negative commentary from retailers, but that juxtaposition is a useful reminder that publicly traded corporations account for a minority of economic activity in the U.S.,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales in April rose across all categories, with the exception of building materials and garden equipment. Auto sales posted their largest gain in 13 months after slumping in March. Sales at clothing stores increased by the most since May 2015.

Online retailers reported the biggest sales gain since June 2014. Consumers also spent on sporting goods and hobbies, electronics and appliances, and they visited restaurants and bars. Building materials and garden equipment sales, however, recorded their biggest drop since August.

635,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2016 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories post largest gain in nine months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories rose more than expected in March as automobile stocks recorded their biggest increase since 2013, suggesting that the
first-quarter's weak economic growth estimate could be revised higher.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that inventories increased 0.4 percent in March, the largest rise since June, after an unrevised 0.1 percent dip in February.
Auto inventories surged 2.3 percent, the biggest increase since October 2013, following a 1.6 percent rise in February.
The inventory-to-sales ratio for motor vehicles rose to 2.30 in March, the highest since April 2009.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.4 percent in March after increasing 0.2 percent in February.
The government reported last month that inventories subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth, helping to restrict economic growth to a 0.5 percent annualized rate.
Data on retail sales, construction spending and factory orders have suggested the advance first-quarter GDP growth estimate could be raised to a 0.9 percent rate when the
government publishes its revision later this month. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Businesses accumulated record inventory in the first half of 2015, which outpaced demand. Though the pace of accumulation slowed, inventories remained high in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
Business sales rose 0.3 percent in March, the largest increase in nine months, after falling 0.3 percent in February.
At March's sales pace, it would take 1.41 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from February.

The high ratio suggests businesses could continue working through the inventory overhang through the first half of the year, hurting manufacturing and curbing GDP growth.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that retail sales increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.3% last month, surprising the forecast for a rise of 0.8%. Retail sales for March dropped 0.3%, whose figure was revised up from an initial 0.4% decline.
April's read was the biggest jump since March 2015.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in April, compared to forecasts for an advance of 0.5%. Core sales in March gained 0.4%, which was revised up from the initial estimate of a 0.2% increase.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy more than doubled its expansion rate in the first quarter as spending picked up, cementing its role as the growth engine for a region in which the effects of high-powered monetary stimulus appear to be gaining traction.
The euro zone's dominant economy grew 0.7 percent, its strongest quarterly rate since an identical reading in the first quarter of 2014 as higher state and household expenditure more than offset a dip in foreign trade, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.
The figure beat forecasts as well as a preliminary growth rate of 0.5 percent in the currency bloc as a whole announced by European statistics agency Eurostat in Brussels.
Separate national GDP data published on Friday showed quarterly growth accelerated to 0.3 percent in Italy and to 0.5 percent in the Netherlands.
For the German economy, private consumption has overtaken trade as the most important growth driver, with record-low unemployment, low interest rates and higher wages pushing households to spend more.
Also on Friday, Germany's biggest trade union, IG Metall, said it agreed a two-stage wage increase of 4.8 percent over 21 months, which analysts said should further boost consumption.
Investment in construction and capital goods rose, the statistics office said, boosted by relatively mild winter weather that had a similar impact in some other euro zone countries, while Europe's migrant crisis also played a role.
""It is likely that higher public expenditure contributed to growth in a number of countries, in some cases lifted by spending to deal with the influx of refugees (which was true of Germany),"" Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS, said of the Eurostat data.
Policymakers at the European Central Bank said the investment jump was unlikely to be a blip, supporting the blocâs slow but steady recovery which the bank has underpinned with its stimulus program.
Buying 1.7 trillion euros ($1.93 trillion) worth of assets and cutting rates deep into negative territory, the ECB has pushed down borrowing costs for governments, businesses and households, hoping to kick-start spending to generate growth.
Though the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy has been criticized by German politicians, economists linked it to the rise in consumption as well as a booming real estate sector.
SPEND, SPEND, SPEND
Germany's quarterly growth rate easily beat the 0.3 percent posted in the final three months of 2015, and was also higher than all but four of the euro zone states for which Eurostat published quarterly figures.
But the unadjusted year-on-year figure of 1.3 percent missed the Reuters consensus forecast of 1.5 percent, and the
economy ministry in Berlin said it expected German growth to slow.
That view was shared by economists, who said the impact of weaker exports - a trend fueled by a stronger euro currency - would eventually be felt as demand from emerging markets ebbs.
""Trade remains the problem child because of weakness in emerging markets,"" said Sal. Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens.
Holger Sandte of Nordea added: ""Growth will not remain so strong, but strong enough so employment continues to rise.""
Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the government should increase investments, echoing calls by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
""The German economy started 2016 on a good footing: industry posted an increase in production, employment is noticeably rising, and higher income of private households is leading to higher private spending,"" Gabriel said.
""Our task is to use this momentum to invest in education, modern infrastructure and innovation.""
But ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the strong data might provide more ammunition for German politicians to resist calls by the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to reform the economy.
The IMF has urged Germany to boost investment, and reform its labor market and pension system, while the OECD has also called for tax reductions.

""The strong growth performance also shows what currently is the biggest risk for the German economy: complacency,"" Brzeski said.

646,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2016 06:40AM ET</span>","Hong Kong's first-quarter GDP contracts on weak exports, spending","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's economy shrank in the first quarter from the final quarter of 2015, hit by falling exports and weak consumer spending, with the risk that momentum will slow further.
On the doorstep of the world's second-largest economy, Hong Kong has been buffeted by China's slowdown. A slump in visitors from the mainland, weak retail sales and falling asset prices have combined to put the economy on the verge of recession.
The trade-dependent economy contracted 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the first contraction in nearly two years.
On an annual basis, growth was just 0.8 percent in the first quarter, its weakest pace in four years. It was worse than economists' expectations for 1.48 percent growth and less than half the pace of the fourth quarter.
""We think in the second quarter, or even the second half, there should be even more of a slowdown,"" said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
""I am also worried that the whole macro situation in Hong Kong looks like we are not any better than 1997 and 1998,"" he said referring to the period before the Asian Financial crisis.
Hong Kong's economy grew 2.4 percent in 2015, about half the pace of 2011, as China's slowdown and a weaker yuan curbed Chinese spending, while a volatile stock market also hit domestic consumption.
A string of retailers from fashion to jewelry firms have posted grim performance figures, with retail sales contracting for the 12th successive month in March,
Hong Kong's tourist arrivals, which dropped 20.5 percent in February, slid 4.3 percent from a year earlier to 4.21 million in March. Mainland visitors, which accounted for 72 percent of the total, fell 6.9 percent to 3.02 million.
Cracks are also widening in the city's real estate market, one of the most expensive in the world, and accounting for nearly a fifth of economic output.
Apartment prices are down by 12 percent from a September high and investment banks predict a further 20 percent decline in coming months.
While the city's leaders have announced a range of relief measures in its March budget, a turnaround in economic activity is unlikely in the near term given weak global growth and Hong Kong's strong links to a slowing Chinese economy, analysts say.

Eurostat said that GDP growth was 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter and 1.5 percent year-on-year. 
On April 29, it had reported the fastest rate of expansion for five years, with quarterly growth of 0.6 percent and a year-on-year figure of 1.6 percent.
Of the euro zone's larger economies, German GDP increased by 0.7 percent, French GDP by 0.5 percent, in Italy by 0.3 percent and in Spain by 0.8 percent.
GDP expanded in all euro zone countries which provided data except Greece and Latvia, which contracted by 0.4 and 0.1 percent respectively. Outside the euro zone, the economies of Hungary and Poland also shrank in the first three months of the year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept its base interest rate steady for an 11th straight month on Friday, as expected. 
Market participants believe the BOK is waiting for more data before it cuts rates again to support a slow recovery hobbled by weak exports.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee left its base rate  unchanged at 1.50 percent, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT).
Investors will look to the governor's news conference for clues on future policy direction - especially to see whether Friday's decision was unanimous as it was the first meeting for four new board members at the BOK.
""I see two reasons for the rate hold today. First is that there has not been a decision on structural reforms. Also, only three weeks and three days have passed since the last decision, and there are new board members, so it is difficult to reach a policy change within that short period of time,"" said Shin Eol, a fixed-income analyst at Hyundai Securities. Shin sees a June rate cut.
All but two of the 26 analysts surveyed by Reuters this week had forecast the Bank of Korea would leave its base rate unchanged at Friday's meeting but a majority of respondents see the bank cutting soon.
The won  erased some of its losses against the dollar after the decision, trading down 0.6 percent as of 0112 GMT. June futures on three-year treasury bonds  fell 0.06 points to trade at 110.36.
The recovery has been bumpy, with private consumption recording a downturn in the first quarter while exports have been falling since last year, making it difficult for the economy to gain any growth traction. 

Against this dreary backdrop, calls for the central bank to act have been growing. An ongoing restructuring of South Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industries has only intensified this pressure, as the sector faces a potential credit crunch which the BOK is expected to prevent by providing capital.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week to a more than one-year high, but economists blamed striking telecommunications workers for the surge and said the data did not signal a deterioration in the overall labor market.
Another report on Thursday showed import prices increased in April for a second straight month, suggesting the disinflationary impulse from a strong dollar and lower oil prices, which has helped to hold inflation well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, was fading. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended May 7, the highest level since late February 2015, the Labor Department said. It was the third consecutive week of increases in first-time applications for jobless benefits.
""We have to look past the noise in the latest jobless claims number because it was likely influenced by the Verizon strike. The broader underlying trend in claims remains very constructive,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
RBC Capital Markets said first-time applications for jobless benefits would have fallen last week excluding the impact of the strike. About 40,000 Verizon (N:VZ) workers walked off the job in mid-April.
Other economists blamed the spike in claims on difficulties adjusting the data due to seasonal variations and other factors.
Unadjusted jobless claims last week surged in New York state and Pennsylvania, which economists tied to the Verizon dispute. Unadjusted claims increased in Michigan. 
""New York state provides unemployment insurance benefits for striking workers when an employer hires permanent replacement workers,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Verizon reportedly increased the ranks of replacement workers in the past two weeks, which we believe made striking workers eligible.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims slipping to 270,000 in the latest week.
JOB MARKET STILL FIRM 
Despite the jump last week, claims have now remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 62 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds slipped. U.S. stocks fell as shares of Apple (O:AAPL) dropped to a near two-year low.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 10,250 to 268,250 last week, the highest level in almost three months.
Coming on the heels of data last week showing nonfarm payrolls increased only 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months, the claims report could raise concerns that the labor market was slowing.
The labor market has been fairly robust despite a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. A report on Tuesday showed job openings hit an eight-month high in March, with the rate re-testing its post-recession high.
""The claims data ... have increased significantly over the most recent three weeks and this does suggest that the labor market has deteriorated lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""But we do not want to read too much into the individual weekly figures, especially around this time of year.""
In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices increased 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in March. The rise last month reflected a pick-up in oil prices and the dollar's depreciation.

""We think the declines in headline and nonfuel import prices are likely behind us and import prices will probably be less of a restraining factor on domestic inflation going forward,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

inflation could start firming in the months ahead.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that import prices increased 0.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March. The rise last month reflected a pick-up in oil prices and the dollar's depreciation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.5 percent in April after March's previously reported 0.2 percent advance. 
Prices for imported goods were down 5.7 percent in the 12 months through April, reflecting the lingering effects of the dollar's sharp rally and the oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015.
Last month's increase in import prices implied that the disinflationary impulse from a stronger dollar, which has helped to hold inflation well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, was fading.
The dollar (DXY) has this year weakened 2.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners. The greenback gained 20 percent on a trade-weighted basis between June 2014 and December 2015. At the same time, oil prices have pushed off multi-year lows.
Imported petroleum prices increased 4.1 percent last month after rising 9.6 percent in March. 
Import prices excluding petroleum edged up 0.1 percent, the first increase since March 2014. 
Imported food prices jumped 1.3 percent last month, also the largest gain since March 2014. Prices for imported industrial supplies and materials excluding petroleum increased 0.4 percent. 
Prices for imported capital goods slipped 0.1 percent, while the cost of imported automobiles edged up 0.1 percent. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding autos fell 0.3 percent.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 6 increased by 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 from the previous weekâs total of 274,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 4,000 to 270,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 61 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended April 29 also unexpectedly rose to 2.161 million from 2.124 million in the preceding week. The previous weekâs figure was revised up from 2.121 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to slip to 2.120 million.
The four-week moving average was 268,250, an increase of 10,250 from the previous week's unrevised figure of 258,000.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The BOE said it was holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.50%, in a widely expected move. The rate has been held at that record-low level since March 2009.
The central bank also said it was to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at Â£375 billion.
All nine MPC members also were in favor of making no changes to the central bank's Â£375 billion asset-purchase program.
In the minutes, the BoE explained that inflation remained well below the 2% target.
""This shortfall is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to fade over the next year,,"" the BoE said.
""Core inflation also remains subdued, largely as a result of weak global price pressures, the past appreciation of sterling and restrained domestic cost growth,"" the bank added.
The minutes also noted expectations for a further deceleration in the second quarter.
BoE cuts growth forecasts; warns on Brexit
In the separately released inflation report, the BoE cut its growth forecast for the second quarter to 0.3%, compared to the prior estimate of a 0.5% expansion.
For 2016, the central bank lowered its estimate for growth to 2.0%, from the prior 2.2%.
In the minutes, the BoE warned on the danger arising from a Brexit if the U.K. votes to leave the EU in the June 23 referendum, saying that ""the May projection is conditioned on a path for bank rate implied by market rates and on continued UK membership of the European Union, including an assumption for the exchange rate consistent with that"".
""Whatever the outcome of the referendum and its consequences, the MPC will take whatever action is needed to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon,"" the BoE promised.
BoE governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference on the inflation report at 11:30AM GMTT, or 7:30AM ET.

668,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2016 06:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong first-quarter economic growth likely weakest in 4 years,"By Tris Pan and Saikat Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's economy probably grew at its weakest annual pace in four years in the first quarter, hurt by China's slowdown, weak retail sales and falling asset prices.
Four economists survey by Reuters expect growth in the January-March quarter to have slowed to 1.48 percent from a year earlier - the weakest pace since the second quarter of 2012 - and down from 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.
One economist with a quarterly estimate forecast the first quarter grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent from the fourth quarter - when it expanded merely 0.2 percent. 
""Hong Kong's economy is facing myriad headwinds, including an increasingly acute residential property price correction and significant linkages with the slowing Chinese economy,"" said Andrew Wood, head of Asia country risk at BCI research. 
""While we do not envisage the economy tipping into full-scale recession in 2016, the risks of such an event are rising.""
Hong Kong's economy grew 2.4 percent in 2015, about half the pace of 2011, as a slowdown in mainland China and a weaker yuan curbed Chinese spending, while a volatile stock market also hit domestic consumption.
A string of retailers from fashion to jewelry firms have posted grim performance figures, with retail sales contracting for the 12th successive month in March,
Hong Kong's tourist arrivals, which dropped 20.5 percent in February, slid 4.3 percent from a year earlier to 4.21 million in March. Mainland visitors, which accounted for 72 percent of the total, fell 6.9 percent to 3.02 million.
Kelvin Lau, a senior economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in Hong Kong, said the global economy was off to a shaky start in the first quarter fueled by worries over the prospects of U.S. interest rate normalization, China's slowdown, and heightened currency volatility. 
""Given its highly open nature, Hong Kong was not insulated from these external headwinds, which weighed on consumer and investor sentiment,"" he said.
Cracks are also widening in the city's real estate market, one of the most expensive in the world, and accounting for nearly a fifth of economic output.
Apartment prices are down by 12 percent from a September high and investment banks predict a further 20 percent decline in coming months.

While the city's leaders have announced a range of relief measures in its March budget, a turnaround in economic activity is unlikely in the near term given weak global growth and Hong Kong's strong links to a slowing Chinese economy, analysts say.

The figures imply that the bloc's overall economic growth, which hit a five-year high of 0.6 percent in the first quarter, tailed off after a very strong opening month.
Industrial production in the 19-member single currency bloc was 0.8 percent lower in March than in February, against the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists of no change.
Year-on-year, euro zone industrial production rose by 0.2 percent, below the average market expectation of a 1.1 percent increase.
Eurostat also revised down the monthly output figure for February to -1.2 from -0.8 percent, although the year-on-year number went up to a gain of 1.0 from 0.8 percent.
Euro zone March monthly output decreased mostly because of a sharp fall of production of non-durable goods. Production of durable consumer goods, such as fridges, decreased by 0.4 percent and of capital goods, such a machinery, declined by 1.1 percent.
Output of intermediate goods was 0.8 percent lower. 
Energy was the only sector with higher production, rising 2.0 percent.

The two largest economies of the euro zone saw a drop in their monthly output, in Germany by 1.0 percent, France 0.3 percent. Italian industrial production was unchanged.

The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence slipped to 43.5, the lowest index reading since November 2014.
The Cabinet Office, which conducts the survey, said the economy showed weakness due to concerns about private spending and downward pressure on sentiment from the quakes. 
""There are many worries such as the unstable global economy, an impact from the quakes, a strong yen and weak share prices and it is difficult to forecast the outlook,"" said a respondent from the retail industry in the survey.
""I think the situation will continue to be severe.""
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, declined to 45.5 in April, also the lowest since November 2014.
""The prospect for the economy is uncertain, so corporations and consumers find it difficult to spend actively,"" said another respondent from the auto sector.
Japan's economy remains stagnant with economists expecting the data to show growth for January-March, due out next week, to be modest.

""There is an increasing uncertainty over April-June quarter due to economic downside risks,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

Accounting for calendar adjustments, April would have shown a $147 billion surplus compared with an adjusted $157 billion surplus in April 2015.
The current fiscal year-to-date deficit was $355 billion, up 25 percent from a $283 billion deficit this time last year. On an adjusted basis, the gap was $310 billion compared with $283 billion last fiscal year.

Receipts last month totaled $438 billion, a 7 percent decrease from the same period last year, while outlays stood at $332 billion.

The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said its monthly leading economic indicator, a measure designed to flag turning points in the world economy, also showed stable growth momentum in the euro zone. 
""CLIs (composite leading indicators) continue to point to easing growth in the United States and the United Kingdom, with the outlook for easing growth now confirmed in Italy,"" it said in a statement.
On an index where 100 represents the long-term average, the OECD said the reading for OECD countries as a whole edged down to 99.6 in March from 99.7 the month before.
China's reading remained at 98.3 in its latest review of conditions. Brazil's improved to 98.3 from 98.0 while Russia's indicator edged up to 98.6 from 98.4.
The U.S. reading edged lower, to 98.8 from 98.9, while the UK reading remained stable at 99.1 and still pointed to easing growth. Germany's indicator stood at 99.7, unchanged from the previous month.

683,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2016 04:40AM ET</span>",UK factory output records biggest annual fall since 2013,"LONDON (Reuters) - British factory output recorded its biggest annual fall in nearly three years in March, as shutdowns in the steel industry due to global overcapacity led broad-based declines, official figures showed on Wednesday.
Manufacturing in March was 1.9 percent lower than a year earlier, the steepest decline since May 2013, the Office for National Statistics said and in line with economists' predictions in a Reuters poll.
In March alone, manufacturing output edged up by 0.1 percent, slightly less than forecast, after dropping by 0.9 percent in February.
But the figures do not point to any revision of the estimate of overall gross domestic product released last month, the ONS said, in part due to big upward revisions for the broader measure of industrial output for February.
These reflected a recalculation of the effect of the leap year, and late data on the oil and gas industry, which recorded a 17.0 percent annual increase in production in February, and a 10.9 percent annual gain in March.
Overall industrial output rose 0.3 percent on the month in March and was 0.2 percent lower than a year earlier.
For the first quarter as a whole, figures were unchanged from those used in April's first-quarter GDP estimate, with a quarterly decline of 0.4 percent.
The ONS said that basic iron and steel manufacturing in March was down by 37.3 percent compared with a year earlier and contributed to a drag of 0.3 percentage points on annual industrial output.
Britain's overall economy slowed in the first quarter, preliminary data has shown, with the pace of growth easing to 0.4 percent compared with 0.6 percent in the previous three months.
Things could get worse in the second quarter. A series of surveys of businesses published last week suggested growth was on course to slow to just 0.1 percent in the April-June period.
The Bank of England has said the approach of the June 23 EU referendum has caused some companies to put investment plans on hold. British manufacturers have also been hurt by the slump in global oil prices, which has hurt many of their clients in the North Sea oil industry, and by the global economic slowdown.
The ONS said it had no anecdotal evidence of the effect of the referendum on output.
The BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold when its monthly policy decision is announced on Thursday. The Bank has previously said that it will try to look beyond volatility in economic data caused by the approach of the referendum.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in March, worse than expectations for a rise of 0.3% and following a decline of 0.9% a month earlier, that was revised down from an initial read of a 1.1% drop.
On an annualized basis, manufacturing production fell at rate of 1.9%, in line with forecasts, after dropping at a rate of 1.6% in February, which was initially tallied as a 1.8% decline.
The report also showed that industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, also missing forecasts for a gain of 0.5% and following a decline of 0.2% in the preceding month, that was revised from an initial read of 0.3%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased in March to the highest level in eight months and layoffs continued to decline, indicating the labor market remains fairly robust despite April's slowdown in employment gains.
The firmer labor market tone was also evident in another report on Tuesday, which showed small businesses increasingly having trouble finding qualified workers to fill open positions.
""The data generally remain upbeat and it does not look like there has been any material weakening in the health of the labor market lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 149,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.8 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. That was the highest reading since July.
The gain lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.9 percent, re-testing its post-recession high, from 3.8 percent in February.
Hiring, however, fell 218,000 to 5.3 million in March, suggesting employers are probably not finding qualified workers for the open positions. The hiring rate slipped to 3.7 percent from 3.8 percent in February.
The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard and continues to suggest the labor market is tightening. 
But labor market strength alone is insufficient to spur the Fed to raise interest rates before the end of the year, given slow economic growth and benign inflation. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Other details of the JOLTS report were fairly upbeat, also indicating that a deceleration in hiring last month probably did not signal a cooling in the jobs market.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months, after advancing by 208,000 jobs in March. The unemployment was unchanged at 5 percent in April.
The JOLTS report showed a further decline in layoffs, while at the same time 2.98 million Americans quit their jobs voluntarily in March, a sign of confidence in the labor market. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.1 percent.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. 
SKILLED WORKER SHORTAGE 
In a separate report, the National Federation of Independent Business said small businesses continued to report a shortage of qualified workers to fill job openings, with some saying they had either raised or planned to increase wages to attract and retain employees. 
The share of small businesses reporting job openings they could not fill jumped in April, revisiting cycle highs. There was also an increase in the proportion of small business owners saying that the quality of labor was their biggest concern.
""With labor market slack diminishing, we expect to see a marked acceleration in wage growth soon,"" said Steve Murphy, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
In March, the number of unemployed job seekers per open job, a measure of labor market slack, was little changed at 1.38.
Professional and business services job openings increased 124,000 in March. There were also gains in transportation, warehousing and utilities, and nondurable goods manufacturing. Job openings decreased 80,000 in retail trade. There were declines in educational services and wholesale trade.
At least 50,000 construction workers voluntarily quit their jobs in March. Quits decreased in arts, entertainment and recreation, which saw an increase in layoffs in March.
Mining and logging layoffs slowed in March, an encouraging sign for a sector that has seen a wave of job losses since late 2014 when oil prices started their downward spiral.

689,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2016 10:33AM ET</span>","U.S. wholesale inventories barely rise, sales rebound","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories barely rose in March as sales recorded their largest increase in nearly a year, suggesting little impact on the first-quarter economic growth estimate.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent. February inventories were revised down to show a 0.6 percent decrease instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent decline.
March's increase in wholesale inventories was in line with expectations. Sales jumped 0.7 percent in March, the largest increase since April last year, after slipping 0.2 percent in February.
Despite March's fairly strong sales pace, it would still take wholesalers 1.36 months to clear shelves, unchanged from February.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - was unchanged in March.
The government reported last month that inventories subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth, helping to restrict economic growth to a 0.5 percent annualized rate.
Data on retail sales, construction spending and factory orders have suggested the advance first-quarter GDP growth estimate could be raised to a 0.9 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Businesses accumulated record inventory in the first half of 2015, which outpaced demand. Though the pace of accumulation slowed, inventories remained high in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

Inventories have been a drag on GDP growth since the third quarter of 2015. In March, wholesale inventories of automobiles rose 1.0 percent, the largest increase since last July. There were also increases in furniture, apparel, petroleum and hardware inventories.

Analysts had expected the number of job openings to decline to 5.431 million.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose strongly in the first quarter and exports soared in March, data showed on Tuesday, propelling the trade surplus in Europe's largest economy to a record high.
Production was strong in the first three months of the year despite a bigger-than-expected drop in March and the overall robust readout is likely to heat up debate about how Germany's strong exports are fuelling global economic imbalances.
The United States has for years called for Germany and other countries with current account surpluses to do more to boost lackluster domestic demand.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have also urged Germany to step up public and private investment in infrastructure to reduce its current account surplus.
Industrial output fell by 1.3 percent in March, the strongest monthly decline since August 2014, data from the Economy Ministry showed. The figure came in below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 0.2 percent fall.
In the first three months of the year, output rose by 1.8 percent on the quarter, driven mainly by a strong hike in construction activity and higher demand for capital goods.
""Despite March's sharp fall in German industrial production, the sector appears to have contributed strongly to GDP growth in Q1,"" Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said, adding the German economy may even have outpaced the 0.6 percent average growth for the euro zone as a whole in the first quarter.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary data for gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter on Friday.
Leading economic institutes have said the economy probably expanded by around 0.6 percent on the quarter in the January-March period - twice as much as in the fourth quarter.
""The industrial sector has overcome its foreign trade related weak phase of the second half of 2015,"" the Economy Ministry said. ""The economic trend in the industrial sector is currently pointing upward.""
STRONG EXPORTS
Separate data from the Federal Statistics Office showed that seasonally adjusted exports rose by a bigger-than-expected 1.9 percent in March while imports fell by a bigger-than-expected 2.3 percent, widening the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to a new monthly record of 23.6 billion euros ($26.82 billion).
The wider current account surplus also hit a fresh monthly record of 30.4 billion euros on an unadjusted basis.
""The strong increase in exports shows that the cooling of the global economy cannot have been as severe as some feared at the beginning of the year,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. 
He pointed out that, at least in the first two months of the year, France has again taken the number one spot as Germany's most important export destination while the United States has dropped to number two.
In 2015, the German economy grew by 1.7 percent, the strongest rate in four years, driven mainly by strong private consumption and higher state spending on refugees and infrastructure.
It is expected to grow by around the same amount this year, despite concerns about weaker foreign demand for German goods due to an economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets.

The data came after factory orders rose more than expected in March due to buoyant foreign demand especially from countries outside the euro zone, suggesting that a strong start to the year for the German economy may extend into the second quarter.

694,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2016 06:21AM ET</span>",U.S. small business confidence rises from two-year low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small business confidence rebounded from a two-year low in April amid growing labor market optimism, supporting views economic growth will regain momentum in the second quarter.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said on Tuesday its small business optimism index increased 1.0 point to a reading of 93.6 last month. 
It was the first increase in the index this year. The index hit a two-year low in March. Despite April's jump, it remained below the 100 reading in December 2014 and its 42-year average of 98. 
Last month's increase is in line with expectations that the economy will pick up speed in the second quarter after gross domestic product growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the first three months of the year.
Growth was hampered by the lingering effects of the dollar's rally between June 2014 and December 2015, weak global demand, an inventory overhang as well as low oil prices, which have hurt profits in the energy sector.
Five components of the NFIB index rose last month, while four were unchanged and one declined. Labor market measures increased, with the share of small business owners reporting hiring gaining five points to 53 percent, but many said they could not find suitable workers for the open positions. 
There was also an increase in the number of owners planning to hire workers, with most of the job creation in construction, manufacturing and professional services. While there was an improvement in the share of small business owners reporting higher sales, an equal number said sales were weak.

There was an improvement in the share of owners reporting an increase in inventories, but the share of owners planning capital outlays over the next three to six months was unchanged.

698,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2016 01:47AM ET</span>",China April inflation data sharpens debate on need for more easing,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumer inflation remained modest in April, while producer prices' four-year slump moderated as commodity prices rebounded, easing concerns about deflationary risks to the world's second-largest economy.
But analysts disagreed on whether the price trends alone are compelling enough for the central bank to shift to a more cautious stance on interest rate cuts just yet, after lowering them six times since late 2014.
Strong March data had raised hopes the economy was bottoming out from a prolonged slump -- possibly allowing the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to take its foot off the gas -- but mixed April data so far and surging debt levels have fueled doubts about whether any recovery will prove sustainable.
""With regards to monetary policy, we do not expect inflation to play a large part in the central bank's thinking,"" said Chester Liaw an economist at Forecast in Singapore.
""Inflation prints are not too high to dissuade them from further easing if need be, and not too low to warrant loosening.""
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent in April from a year earlier, largely due to a spike in food prices, particularly pork. The reading has now been at the same level for three months in a row, and April defied market expectations for a slight pick-up in inflationary pressures.
Non-food prices rose just 1.1 percent, ticking up from March, but again not showing a build in price pressures that would be expected if the broader economy was suddenly perking up.
Producer price trends in April were more encouraging, with price declines easing to 3.4 percent from a year earlier, less than the 3.8 percent economists had forecast and a fall of 4.3 percent in March. On a sequential basis, the producer price index (PPI) rose for the second month in a row.
HSBC believes downside risks to growth and inflation mean it is too early to change China's policy stance just yet.
But some analysts maintain that if inflation stays at current levels, there is less need for more cuts to interest rates or banks' reserve requirements.
""We think that CPI could peak in Q2 as the pork price cycle turns, but at above 2 percent it's already at a level which constrains the room for further rate cuts,"" said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong.
Economist Nie Wen at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai agreed. He expected no further interest rate cuts this year, but said more reductions in banks' reserve requirements were still likely.
Indeed, an IMF official told Reuters in early May that China's policy might be too accommodative at present and it might need to start tightening policy.
SHORT-LIVED?
There are suspicions that signs of improvement in both consumer and producer prices might prove short-lived.
Beijing has released 3 million kg of frozen pork reserves in a bid to combat rising prices, which jumped 33.5 percent in April. And overall food prices dipped in April from March.
China's consumer inflation rate also remains well below the official 3 percent target, indicating persistently weak demand and downward pressure on prices from massive overcapacity.
On the producer side, a recent rally in prices of raw materials such as iron ore and steel that resuscitated corporate cash flows is rapidly fizzling.
""The acceleration of PPI inflation in the past two months is largely due to surging steel prices pushed up by speculative flows, rather than improving demand,"" Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said in a note.
""As long as the underlying demand remains sluggish, we think that PPI inflation is likely to turn soft soon. We believe that China's monetary policy stance will remain accommodative in the foreseeable future.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Higher food and fuel prices probably nudged India's annual inflation up to 5.0 percent in April from 4.83 percent in March, according to a Reuters poll, making it harder for the central bank to follow up last month's interest rate cut too swiftly.
The consumer price data  is due to be released at 1200 GMT on Thursday.
""The central bank has to be confident of hitting the 5 percent target next year before deciding on easing further,"" said Rishi Shah, economist at Deloitte.
Shah expects inflation to rise to 5.20 percent in April, though the median forecast from the survey of 27 economists was 5.0 percent.
Last month, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent, the lowest since 2011.
A recent Reuters poll predicted only one more interest rate cut in 2016, most likely toward the end of the year.
""Unless inflation really surprises on the downside, we don't see much happening and the focus should be on liquidity rather than interest rates for now,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities.
Above-average monsoon rains are expected this year and should spur rural demand as two-thirds of India's population depends on farming for its livelihood.
""The monsoons will play an important part in determining growth by giving a boost to rural demand in the industrial sector, as we believe that a more sustained increase in investments is still some time away,"" Shah said.
The latest poll also showed industrial output  grew 2.5 percent in March, faster than 2.0 percent the month before.

That quickening in pace is mostly due to a surge in infrastructure output, which accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure and hit a 16-month high in March.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose more than expected in March due to buoyant foreign demand especially from countries outside the euro zone, data showed on Monday, in a sign that a solid start to the year for Europe's biggest economy may extend into the second quarter.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods were up 1.9 percent on the month, the biggest increase since last June, the Economy Ministry said on Monday. That beat a Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of only 0.7 percent.
While domestic orders fell by 1.2 percent, foreign demand rose by 4.3 percent, with orders from euro zone countries edging up by 1.1 percent and bookings from countries outside the currency bloc soaring by 6.2 percent.
""The solid economic development in the U.S. is currently an important pillar of (German) domestic industry,"" said VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel, adding that companies also seemed to be benefiting from recent positive economic news from China.
""So after today's data, we all can breathe easily,"" he said.
Dirk Schlotboeller, economist at DIHK Chambers of Commerce, said that weak domestic investment remained a problem for the German economy. ""Domestic orders are again disappointing, the trend is still pointing downward,"" Schlotboeller said.
A breakdown for sectors showed bookings for capital goods and consumer products surged, while demand for intermediate goods was weaker than in February.
The data for February was revised up to a fall of 0.8 percent from a previously reported drop of 1.2 percent.
For the whole first quarter, industrial orders rose by 0.5 percent on the quarter, with bookings from abroad increasing by 2.0 percent and domestic orders falling by 1.3 percent.
STRONG START
The surprisingly strong March figure suggests that industrial output is likely to pick up in the coming months after making a solid start to the year.
""Despite the overcast foreign trade environment, German industry was able to post a noticeable increase in orders from abroad,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement, adding it expected industry to continue its moderate growth pace.
Leading economic institutes have said the German economy probably expanded by around 0.6 percent on the quarter in the January-March period - twice as much as in the fourth quarter.
Preliminary data for German gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter is due to be published on Friday.
In 2015, the economy grew by 1.7 percent, the strongest rate in four years, driven mainly by strong private consumption and higher state spending on refugees.
It is expected to grow by around the same amount this year, despite slacking exports due to an economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is expected to have barely grown in the first quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, as stagnant consumer spending and wobbly financial markets keep expectations for more government stimulus measures alive.
Gross domestic product (GDP) was seen to have expanded at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent in January-March, according to the poll of 19 analysts, after a 1.1 percent contraction in October-December.
That would translate into a quarterly expansion of 0.1 percent, the poll showed, following a 0.3 percent decline in the final quarter last year.
Analysts say the slight growth was due to the extra day in the quarter from the leap year and that the economy may have even contracted without that factor.
""The GDP data will probably show the actual economy lacks strength,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank. 
""There are signs of a pickup in exports and corporations keeping firm capital spending plans, which support the economy, while private spending stays at a standstill.""
The poll found private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, likely grew 0.2 percent in the first quarter after a 0.9 percent fall in the previous quarter.
Capital spending fell 0.8 percent after rising 1.5 percent and external demand contributed 0.1 of a percent point to growth in the first quarter, according to the poll.
The Cabinet Office will announce GDP data on May 18 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, May 17).
The poll of analysts also found the current account balance, which will be published on May 12, is expected to post a surplus of 3.0 trillion yen ($27.95 billion) in March, the largest surplus since March 2007.

Slides in imports largely due to oil price falls and income from investments overseas at Japan's fiscal year-end likely bolstered the balance of payment, marking 21 straight months of surplus.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports fell more than expected in April, underlining weak demand at home and abroad and cooling hopes of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
Exports fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs said on Sunday, reversing the previous month's brief recovery and supporting the government's concerns that the foreign trade environment will be challenging in 2016.
April imports dropped 10.9 percent from a year earlier, falling for the 18th consecutive month, suggesting domestic demand remains weak despite a pickup in infrastructure spending and record credit growth in the first quarter.
""Both exports and imports came in weaker than expected, in line with the soft trade performance across Asia, pointing to another challenging year for emerging markets,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
China's exports to the United States â the countryâs top export market â fell 9.3 percent in April from a year earlier, while shipments to the European Union â the second biggest market, rose 3.2 percent, customs data showed.
China's cabinet has vowed to take steps to boost exports, including encouraging banks to boost lending, expanding export credit insurance and raise tax rebates for some firms.
China had a trade surplus of $45.56 billion in April, versus forecasts of $40 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected April exports to fall 0.1 percent, after a surprise 11.5 percent rise in March, and expected imports to fall 5 percent, following March's 7.6 percent decline.
MOMENTUM MAY WEAKEN
China's economic growth slowed to 6.7 percent in the first quarter - the weakest since the global financial crisis, but activity picked up in March as policy steps to boost the economy, including six interest rate cuts since late 2014, seemed to be taking effect.
Concerns of a hard-landing in China had eased after the strong March data, but analysts have warned the rebound may be short-lived.
Economists expect a slowdown in credit growth and industrial production in April although inflation could accelerate. Key economic data is expected over the next two weeks.
""The market has to prepare a little bit for the downside risk in other Chinese data and some sort of market correction might be inevitable,"" Zhou said.
An official factory survey and Caixin's private-sector gauge for April painted a mixed picture of the health of the manufacturing sector.
The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed factory activity expanded for the second month in a row in April but only marginally, while Caixin's manufacturing PMI pointed to 14 straight months of sector contraction.
China's central bank said on Friday that it will fine tune policy in a pre-emptive and timely way, as the economy still faces downward pressure despite signs of steadying.

Amid shrinking global demand, China still managed to grow its share of world exports to 13.8 percent last year from 12.3 percent in 2014, indicating the country's export sector remains competitive despite higher costs.

717,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2016 04:23PM ET</span>",Smallest U.S. job gains in seven months temper rate hike expectations,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added the fewest number of jobs in seven months in April and Americans dropped out of the labor force, signs of weakness that left some economists anticipating only one interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 160,000 jobs last month as construction employment barely rose and the retail sector shed jobs for the first time since December 2014, the Labor Department said on Friday.
April's job gains were the smallest since September and below the first-quarter average job growth of 200,000. Adding to the report's soft tone, employers added 19,000 fewer jobs in February and March than previously reported.
The slowdown in hiring came against the backdrop of weak economic growth, subdued productivity and corporate profits. It prompted some financial institutions, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), to lower their interest rate hike expectations for this year to one from two before the report.
""We now only expect one rate hike in 2016, in September, as we believe it will take longer for policymakers to accumulate sufficient evidence that economic and labor market activity is rebounding after a soft start to the year,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Fed officials have forecast two more rate hikes for this year. Economists had expected the first of the two increases in June.
A Reuters survey of Wall Street banks that directly do business with the Fed showed nine out of 17 expected the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy twice this year. This compared to 12 of 16 banks a month ago.
Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations have virtually priced out an interest rate increase at the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch. They see a 42 percent probability of a rate increase in September and a 61 percent chance at the December meeting.
New York Fed President William Dudley, however, told the New York Times on Friday that two rate hikes remained a ""reasonable expectation.""
The dollar initially fell against a basket of currencies on the employment report, but retraced losses after Dudley's comments. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while stocks on Wall Street reversed earlier losses to end higher.
Though the unemployment rate held at 5.0 percent last month that was because people dropped out of the labor force. The stepdown in job gains could temper expectations of a strong rebound in economic activity in the second quarter after growth nearly stalled in the first three months of the year.
Economists had forecast payrolls rising 202,000 last month.
SILVER LININGS
There were some silver linings in the report, with both average hourly earnings and the average work week rising.
Average hourly earnings increased eight cents or 0.3 percent. That took the year-on-year increase to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent in March, still below the 3.0 percent advance that economists say is needed for inflation to rise to the Fed's 2.0 percent target.
The average work week increased to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in March. The 0.4 percent increase in aggregate hours and higher earnings left workers with a 0.7 percent increase in their take-home wages, which should support consumer spending.
Economists said the moderation in job creation was not surprising, citing weak business investment and a shortage of skilled workers in areas like construction.
""Without business growth and development, there is little support for robust job creation. This morning's report suggests we may already be seeing early signs of at least a modest slowdown in the pace of employment,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago.
Other economists saw the slowdown in employment last month as payback for mild winter weather, which had seen strong hiring in retail and construction sectors in the first quarter.
Details of the smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived were mostly weak.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.8 percent. It had increased 0.6 percentage point since dipping to 62.4 percent in September.
The labor force fell by 362,000 as people dropped out in April. The labor force had increased 2.4 million in the prior six months.
The employment-to-population ratio fell to 59.7 percent in April from a seven-year high of 59.9 percent in March. But a broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 9.7 percent last month. The larger establishment survey showed the vast private services sector dominated employment gains in April, adding 174,000 jobs. Retail payrolls fell 3,100 last month after hefty gains in the first quarter, which came despite sluggish sales.
Information sector employment was unchanged last month and a Labor Department official said there was no sign that a strike by about 40,000 Verizon workers had impacted the data.
Manufacturing added 4,000 jobs after shedding 29,000 in March, the biggest loss for the sector since December 2009.
There were further job losses in mining as the energy sector adjusts to weak profits from a recent prolonged plunge in oil prices. Mining payrolls fell 8,000 last month. Mining employment has decreased by 191,000 jobs since peaking in September 2014, with 75 percent of the losses in support activities.
Gains in construction employment slowed sharply, with the sector adding 1,000 jobs in April, after home building showed some signs of fatigue last month. Government payrolls fell 11,000 last month.

The forecasts assume the Australian dollar at a slightly higher level of 62.5 versus 62.0 on a trade-weighted basis while the crude oil price assumption is 30% higher at A$47. As in February, the forecasts have assumed market pricing for the cash rate.
It was the lower outlook for inflation along with latest developments in the housing market which led the RBA to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to a new record low of 1.75% on Tuesday. Inflation is now seen at 1.5% in June, compared to a forecast of 2.0% earlier.
In the Statement on Monetary Policy the RBA didn't indicate an easing bias, but said it would continue to assess the outlook and adjust policy as needed to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the inflation target over time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, posting the biggest gain in more than a year, but the underlying trend continued to point to a strengthening labor market.
Another report on Thursday showed a 35 percent surge in planned layoffs by U.S.-based employers last month. Most of the announced job cuts were concentrated in the energy sector, which is reeling from low oil prices that have hurt profits.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000 for the week ended April30, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase was the largest since February of last year.
""We are assuming the move in claims is largely technical. By all accounts, businesses cannot find the skilled labor they need,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims rising to 260,000 in the latest week. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 61 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,000 to 258,000 last week.
Prices for U.S. government debt slightly pared losses after the data, while the U.S. dollar (DXY) edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock futures were trading higher.
The latest claims data has no bearing on April's employment report as it falls outside the survey period. 
Claims were generally low in April compared to March. That points to a fairly robust labor market despite a report on Wednesday showing hiring by employers in the private sector last month was the weakest in three years. 
Though the ADP National Employment Report showed a slowdown in services industry hiring last month, an Institute for Supply Management survey showed employment in the services sector increased in April for a second straight month.
'HEAVY JOB CUTS'
In a second report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based companies announced 65,141 job cuts last month, up 35 percent from March. The energy sector announced another 19,759 job cuts in April, bringing its total layoffs this year to 72,660. They were also layoffs in the information technology and retail sectors.
""It is not unusual to see heavy job cuts in a strong economy. Companies are constantly retooling, and sometimes the best time to do that is when the economy is strong,"" said John Challenger, the chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 202,000 jobs in April after a gain of 215,000 in March. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 5.0 percent and average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.3 percent for a second consecutive month.
Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 8,000 to 2.12 million in the week ended April 23, the lowest level since November 2000. 

The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims declined 17,000 to 2.14 million, also the lowest reading since November 2000.

For the first time in recent years, the central bank said that the government's fiscal position had become expansionary, instead of neutral, complicating its efforts to fight inflation that earlier this year surged to a 12-year high.
The bank's 2016 inflation forecast has fallen from its previous estimate as the recession worsens, but remains above the 4.5 percent center of the official target range, according to the minutes. 
Last week, the bank's 8-member board, known as Copom, left its benchmark Selic rate  unchanged at 14.25 percent for the sixth straight time. 

The central bank's board will likely be replaced once Vice President Michel Temer takes the presidency next week if the Senate, as expected, suspends President Dilma Rousseff for allegedly breaking budget laws. The change of the board and its governor, Alexandre Tombini, will be done gradually, according to Temer advisers.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 3,000 to 260,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level, which is usually associated with a firming labor market, for 61 consecutive weeks.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended April 20 fell to 2.121 million from 2.121 million in the preceding week. The previous weekâs figure was revised up from 2.130 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.133 million.
The four-week moving average was 258,000, an increase of 2,000 from the previous week's unrevised figure of 256,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed in April and may stall as consumers worry about June's EU referendum, reaching levels at which in the past the Bank of England began to consider rate cuts, a survey of the dominant services industry showed.
If last month's weakness persists, economic growth may be just 0.1 percent in the second quarter, down from 0.4 percent in the first three months of this year, financial data company Markit said on Thursday.
That would be the weakest quarterly reading since late 2012.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the deterioration in April pushed the surveys into territory which ""has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth"" by easing monetary policy.
The services sector grew at its lowest rate in more than three years, according to Markit's activity index, which fell to 52.3 from 53.7 in March, below the lowest forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Companies said uncertainty about the referendum and weakness in the global economy were worrying the main drivers of Britain's recovery: its consumers.
""In combination with the weaker-than-expected manufacturing index earlier in the week that points to a pretty subdued Q2 GDP reading,"" Alan Clarke, strategist at Scotiabank said, predicting a less marked slowdown to 0.2 percent in the second quarter.
""The (BoE) has told us that it will be a little less sensitive than usual to the hard data given the EU referendum uncertainty. Nonetheless, a ... GDP number of 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter (or lower) is likely to test the patience of some of the doves.""
Sterling fell while gilts showed little reaction to the data.
Britain's economy has outpaced much of the rest of the rich world over the past three years. But it has been showing signs of slowing since late last year.
Economists generally believe a Brexit vote on June 23 would deal at least a short-term blow to the economy, possibly prompting the BoE to cut already record-low interest rates or expand its bond-buying program. 
But it would also probably weaken the pound, adding to inflation and making it more difficult for the BoE to act.
Thursday's survey showed growth in input costs paid by service companies were the highest in over two years in April, suggesting that a gradual rise in inflation will continue. 
Williamson said the early timing of this year's Easter holiday might also have contributed to the slowdown.
Job growth was also at its slowest in April since August 2013, reflecting a recent weakening in the labor market as a whole.
Britain's economy increasingly relies on services, with manufacturing and construction failing to contribute to growth for much of the past year. Surveys of those sectors published this week suggested that trend was likely to continue.

Manufacturing output unexpectedly shrank in April while construction output grew at its slowest rate in nearly three years.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS Services Purchasing Managers Index dropped to 52.3 last month from a reading of 53.7 in March.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to 53.5 in April.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
The rate of expansion slowed for the third time in the past five months to its weakest level since February 2013.
The report also revealed the slowest rise in employment since August 2013 and that input price inflation hit a 27-month high.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson pointed out that the service sector data, coupled with similar weakness in manufacturing and construction made âa triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter.â
âThe PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April,â Williamson warned.
Although, Wiliamson noted that some of the slowdown could be attributable to the timing of Easter, he noted that April also asserted that there was an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the U.K.âs June 23 referendum on its membership in the European Union (EU) caused customers to hold back on purchases, âexacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts.â
âThe deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or through non-standard measures such as QE,â Williamson concluded.
GBP/USD was trading at 1.4467 from around 1.4480 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7909 from 0.7902 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded higher, with Londonâs FTSE 100 gaining 0.64%. The EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.76%, France's CAC 40 trade up 0.36%, while Germany's DAX advanced 0.74%."

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for April dropped to 51.8 from 52.2 in March, as new business increased at the fastest pace since January while business expectations remained unchanged.
Readings above 50 indicate an expansion on a monthly basis, while readings below signal contraction.
The employment sub-component rose to 50.9 in April from March's 48.9, reversing the first decline in staffing since August 2013.
The solid new business reading was boosted by stronger underlying client demand and new products, the survey said, while companies were also able to pass along higher input prices.
""Expansion in the services sector helped offset some of the impact caused by flagging manufacturing. Overall, however, the economy still faces relatively strong downward pressure,"" He Fan, chief economist of Caixin, said in a note.
""The government needs to keep implementing moderate stimulus to prevent a hard landing of the economy.""
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI number dropped in April after a return to growth in March, with the headline figure falling to 50.8 in April from 51.3 in March. Still, the April reading was the second highest since May 2015.
The composite employment figure rose to 48.3 in April from 47.6 in March, but it still marked the 11th straight month of contraction in employment.
China's official services survey released May 1 showed activity in the industry remained strong in April but grew at a slightly slower pace, with the official reading at 53.5, compared with 53.8 in March.
China's official factory survey and Caixin's private survey for April gave mixed signals on the health of the manufacturing sector.

The official survey showed activity expanded for the second month in a row in April but only marginally, lagging expectations, while the Caixin manufacturing PMI was in negative territory for the 14th month in a row.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector expanded in April as new orders and employment accelerated, bolstering views that economic growth would rebound after almost stalling in the first quarter.
The growth outlook was, however, dimmed by another report on Wednesday showing private employers hired the fewest number of workers in three years in April.
Economists say strong services industry activity together with a rebound in automobile sales in April reported on Tuesday, underscore the economy's firm fundamentals that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates twice this year.
""The earliest indications point to a solid growth rebound of the U.S. economy in the second quarter. If Friday's payrolls report corroborates that trend, a June rate hike certainly remains an option,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index rose 1.2 percentage points to a reading of 55.7 in April, with the majority of industries expressing optimism about the business climate and the economy.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Services industry activity was last month buoyed by a 3.2 percentage point surge in new orders.
A gauge of services sector employment rose to 53.0 last month from a reading of 50.3 in March. Construction firms reported ""severe"" shortages of unskilled labor.
Companies in the energy sector said recent oil price increases had slightly improved the outlook for the industry, but the gains had not been enough to initiate hiring or spending.
The rise in services sector employment last month eclipsed the slightly weak ADP National Employment Report, which showed private payrolls increased 156,000 last month, the smallest gain since April 2013, after rising 194,000 in March.
The step-down in private sector hiring is at odds with other labor market indicators, such as first-time applications for unemployment benefits, which are near four-decade lows. The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey last week also painted an upbeat picture of the jobs market.
""We don't see the ADP employment report as reliable as the weekly jobless claims report. We put more faith in the initial claims report,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
The services industry data and the ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for April scheduled for release on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 202,000 jobs in April after rising 215,000 in March. The unemployment rate is forecast holding steady at 5.0 percent.
The labor market has so far weathered the sluggish economy, which has been slammed by weak exports as a result of the lingering effects of the dollar's rally last year and tepid global demand.
Growth has also been eroded by relentless aggressive spending cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of last year's plunge in oil prices, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.
The government reported last week that the economy slowed to an annual growth pace of 0.5 percent in the first quarter after expanding at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
But economists expect the soft first-quarter GDP growth would be revised to at least a 0.9 percent pace later this month after a third report from the Commerce Department showed a strong increase in factory orders in March.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, rebounding from a more than 15-month low touched on Tuesday. Prices for U.S. government debt rose slightly, while U.S. stocks fell.
In another report, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit fell 13.9 percent to $40.4 billion in March, the smallest since February 2015, as imports of goods plunged to a more than five-year low.
Weak imports potentially signal slackening domestic demand, but could also be related to the ongoing inventory drawdown. Lower oil prices and increased domestic energy production are also helping to keep the import bill in check.
Imports of goods tumbled 4.3 percent to $175.3 billion, the smallest since December 2010. Imports were held down by industrial supplies and materials, which fell to a near 12-year low. Petroleum imports were the lowest since September 2002, even as oil prices rose to an average $27.68 per barrel.
Exports of goods also fell last month, slipping 1.6 percent to $116.8 billion. Exports of food were the lowest since September 2010. Industrial supplies and materials exports fell to a six-year low, while consumer goods exports were the lowest since March 2013.
But there are signs that some of the export drag is starting to fade. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that a gauge of export orders received by U.S. manufacturers rose in April for a second straight month, reaching its highest level since November 2014.
In a fifth report, the Labor Department said productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, declined at a 1.0 percent rate in the first quarter after shrinking at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

Weak productivity helps explain the divergence between lackluster economic growth and the fairly robust labor market.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1 percent after February's downwardly revised 1.9 percent decline.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.6 percent in March after a previously reported 1.7 percent decrease in February.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft were up 0.1 percent March. They had been reported as unchanged in the previous estimate. These so-called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undermined exports of factory goods, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.
Investment cuts by energy firms as they adjust to reduced profits from cheaper oil have also weighed. But some of the drag from the dollar and inventory glut is starting to ebb.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday a gauge of export orders received by U.S. manufacturers rose in April for a second straight month, touching its highest level since November 2014. At the same time, customer inventories fell last month to a level the ISM said was regarded as ""too low.""
The dollar has declined 3.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners so far this year after rallying 20 percent between June 2014 and December 2015.
In March, factory orders were mixed, with orders for transportation equipment increasing 2.8 percent. Orders for machinery rose 0.5 percent and bookings for primary metals increased 0.6 percent. But orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.9 percent. Bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components decreased 2.6 percent. The Commerce Department also said shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.5 percent in March rather than the 0.3 percent gain reported last month.
Inventories of factory goods rose 0.2 percent in March after eight straight months of declines. Shipments of manufactured goods also increased 0.5 percent after falling for eight consecutive months.
The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.37 in March. Unfilled orders at factories dipped 0.1 percent in March.

755,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 09:35AM ET</span>",Canada March trade deficit widens to record as exports slump,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit in March widened to a record C$3.41 billion ($2.69 billion) as exports sank for a second month on weak demand from the crucial U.S. market, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday. 
The deficit, far greater than a C$1.40 billion shortfall forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll, came as Canada is already struggling to deal with the prolonged effects of an oil price slump.
Exports to the United States, which accounted for 74.2 percent of Canada's global total in March, fell by 6.3 percent while imports dropped by 4.8 percent. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States dropped to a 22-year low of C$1.53 billion, down from C$2.12 billion in February.
Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada, described the drop in exports as a concern and linked it to a drawdown in U.S. inventories which he said had cut demand for Canadian goods.
""I wouldn't say this is time to push the panic button but it's time to be alert. This is something that is coming to us squarely from the United States,"" he said in a phone interview.
The Canadian dollar weakened to C$1.2821 to the U.S. dollar, or 78.00 U.S. cents, down from C$1.2748, or 78.44 U.S. cents, shortly before the release. 
The Bank of Canada said on April 20 it could take Canada more than three years to recover from the oil price shock. The central bank is relying on a transition to non-energy exports to help drive the economy.
March exports fell by 4.8 percent to C$40.99 billion, the lowest in more than two years. Shipments declined in 10 of 11 sectors, led by motor vehicles and parts, consumer goods and metal and non-metallic products.
""Certainly as we move through the second quarter the Bank (of Canada) is going to be wanting to see indications of exports rebounding,"" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Imports decreased by 2.4 percent to C$44.40 billion, pulled down by lower shipments of consumer goods, aircraft and other transportation equipment.
March marked Canada's 19th consecutive monthly trade deficit. Export prices dropped by 2.9 percent while volumes declined by 2.0 percent. Import prices declined by 2.1 percent and volumes shrank by 0.3 percent.

Statscan revised February's deficit to C$2.47 billion from an initial C$1.91 billion.

756,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 09:10AM ET</span>","Brazil's services drop in April, with record layoffs: PMI","BRASILIA, (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector fell sharply in April and led firms to shed jobs at a record pace, a private survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting the economy took another turn lower as the political crisis escalated.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI> compiled by research firm Markit fell on a seasonally adjusted basis to 37.4 in April from 38.6 in March. The 50 mark of the index separates contraction from expansion.
The ongoing contraction in services, along with another sharp drop among manufacturers, dragged Markit's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> to the lowest in the nine-year history of the survey, at 39.0 in April, from 40.8 in March.
""Firms shed jobs at record rates as part of efforts to cut costs and stay in business. Higher unemployment is likely to further aggravate domestic demand in coming months,"" Markit economist Pollyana de Lima said.
The Lower House of Brazil's Congress voted in mid-April to impeach President Dilma Rousseff for allegedly breaking budget laws. However, her immediate replacement while she awaits trial, Vice-President Michel Temer, is not expected to take office until May 12, leaving public administration virtually paralyzed.
The decline in manufacturing and services activity suggested by the PMI indexes throws cold water on hopes that Brazil's deep recession could be nearing a bottom. Industrial output grew in March at the fastest pace in more than two years, and business and consumer confidence measures had stabilized.

""Looking ahead, economic prospects remain bleak when so much uncertainty abounds in the market.""

Retail sales, a proxy for household spending, decreased 0.5 percent in March month-on-month in the 19-country currency bloc, Eurostat said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a much smaller decrease of 0.1 percent.
Yearly figures were also lower than expected, with sales up 2.1 percent, below market forecasts of a 2.5 percent rise.
The fall in March sales was partly offset by an upward revision of data for February. Eurostat said on Wednesday that in February sales rose 0.3 percent on a monthly basis and 2.7 percent year-on-year. It had previously estimated an increase of 0.2 percent monthly and 2.4 percent yearly.
On a monthly basis, retail sales of food, drinks and tobacco products dropped 1.3 percent in March, the biggest fall among all the categories.
Sales of non-food products, excluding automotive fuels, went down 0.5 percent month-on-month. Purchases of fuel for cars also dropped 0.4 percent on a monthly basis.
Among the largest euro zone economies, Germany posted a 1.1 percent monthly drop of retail sales and France recorded a decrease of 0.7 percent. In Spain, sales increased 0.4 percent on a monthly basis in March.

(Reuters) - U.S. small business borrowing fell in March, data released on Wednesday showed, pointing to slimming prospects of stronger economic growth ahead.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index fell to 135.3, down from February's upwardly revised 138.9 and marking the index's sixth decline in the last nine months. The PayNet index typically corresponds to U.S. gross domestic product growth one or two quarters ahead.
""There's no bullish sentiment,"" said Bill Phelan, president of PayNet, adding that 11 of the 18 sectors PayNet tracks are on a downward trend. Small business owners, he said, are simply not willing to spend big in hopes of growth.
""If we go out on the risk-taking limb, the branch might get sawed off,"" Phelan said of the thinking among small businesses today. ""Now is not the time to play hero.""
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because little firms tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Loans more than 30 days past due rose slightly in March to 1.48 percent, from 1.47 percent in February, separate data from PayNet showed.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 last month from Marchâs reading of 54.2. That was its slowest pace since June 2013.
Economists had expected the index to inch down to 54.0 in March.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that the April data signaled a further loss of momentum across the UK construction sector, with new order volumes stagnating and overall business activity expanding at its slowest pace since June 2013.
Subdued demand conditions contributed to one of the weakest rises in employment numbers recorded over the past three years.
At the same time, construction firms indicted a softer increase in input buying and noted a renewed fall in optimism regarding the year-ahead business outlook.
Commenting on the report, David Noble, Group Chief Executive Officer at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said, âFears over weaker UK and global economic growth dealt a blow to confidence in the construction sector, leading to delays in new spending commitments.â
âThe prospect of the EU referendum and its outcome in June are likely to add to uncertainty too, with many construction firms preferring to wait and see what happens before making any decisions,â Noble added.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia reported lower than expected growth in the first quarter, but many economists still expect enough of a rebound this year that the country can avoid further slowing and grow more than 5 percent in 2016.
The statistics bureau said on Wednesday that Southeast Asia's largest economy expanded an annual 4.92 percent in the January-March quarter, below the median 5.05 percent in a Reuters poll and the October-December pace of 5.04 percent.
Growth weakened for the fifth straight year in 2015, to 4.8 percent, as poor commodity prices, contracting exports, tepid investment and waning consumption produced the lowest growth rate since 2009.
But the economy gained some momentum in the second half of last year as newly-appointed ministers accelerated government spending.
The statistics bureau took an optimistic tone. 
""Our start in 2016 is better than the start of 2015,"" said bureau head Suryamin. ""Economic activity almost always slows in the first quarter, especially after growing higher in the fourth quarter.
In the first quarter of 2015, annual growth was 4.73 percent.
EL NINO FACTOR
Bureau data showed consumption was stable in the first quarter and there was a rise in government-led investment from a year earlier. However, investment growth was weaker than in the December quarter.
The bureau said a major reason for slower growth was a drought worsened by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which hurt crop output.
Darmin Nasution, chief economics minister, said another reason was slowing loan growth.
Euben Paracuelles, a Nomura economist in Singapore who had projected 5.4 percent first-quarter growth, said there was ""some loss in growth momentum"" as he had expected stronger public investment.
""This will raise the question of the sustainability of the recovery, but we would still argue that the recovery will continue, led by domestic demand,"" he said.
Tim Condon, ING's Asia chief economist, said the lower growth pace in January-March than the previous quarter ""is probably a one-off and the economy is in a sort of healing mode but obviously not a straight line path"".

DETROIT (Reuters) - Detroit automakers reported another month of strong demand from U.S. consumers for trucks and sport utility vehicles on Tuesday, but their shares dropped as analysts focused on signs the world's second-largest auto market has little room to grow.
U.S. light vehicle sales in April totaled 1.51 million, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.42 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. WardsAuto said annualized sales were 17.32 million vehicles.
U.S. auto sales in 2015 hit a record 17.4 million vehicles.
Wall Street analysts say the U.S. auto market is close to a cyclical peak and that more production cuts, which hurt profit, could be needed to keep inventories of vehicles from ballooning later in the year.
""We continue to believe sales growth will be muted this year,"" Joseph Spak of RBC Capital said in a note to investors.
Inventory data issued early on Tuesday pointed to some possible ""risk to North American production over the coming months,"" Spak added.
The sluggish pace of U.S. economic growth adds to concerns that the auto industry recovery could run out of fuel.
April auto sales in Canada were the highest for any month on record, at 200,327 vehicles, consultant Dennis DesRosiers said. Ford,  Fiat  Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and Toyota all reported double-digit gains in Canada.
Shares of General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) closed down 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, as the broader market also declined, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) shares fell 3 percent to $7.96.
GM and Ford said sales to individual consumers were still growing. But because GM has been cutting back on low-profit sales to rental car companies and other fleets, its overall April U.S. sales fell by 3.5 per cent.
GM's results were among many that highlighted a divide in the market between slumping sales of traditional sedans, and robust demand for pickup trucks and SUVs.
GM said sales of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck rose nearly 9 percent in April compared with a year earlier. However, sales of GM's Cadillac CTS and ATS luxury sedans plummeted 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
Other luxury brands also had weak results in April, especially for cars. Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus division suffered a 26 percent decline in sales of cars such as the large LS sedan, although sales of Lexus brand SUVs rose 20 percent.
German luxury car maker BMW AG (DE:BMWG) said sales of its BMW brand passenger cars fell 6.5 percent, while its SUV sales fell 9.7 percent. 
The chief executives of two leading auto dealer groups, AutoNation Inc (N:AN) and Group 1 Automotive (N:GPI), had warned in April that automakers should start curbing production, particularly of slow-selling luxury sedans.
Still, April U.S. sales for Ford, Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) all beat analysts' expectations. Ford's sales rose 4 percent from a year earlier, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was up 5.6 percent and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), No. 3 in the U.S. market, rose 3.8 percent. Honda sales rose 14.4 percent.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.2 last month from a reading of 51.0 in March. That was its lowest level since February 2013.
Analysts had expected the index to advance slightly to 51.2 in April.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Additionally, the report showed near-stagnant trends in output and new orders, while price deflationary pressures eased.
Markit noted that the weakening performance of the manufacturing economy was mainly felt in the consumer and investment goods sectors, with both registering declines in production and new work received.
The research group also remarked that although the intermediate goods sector managed to sustain growth of output and new order inflows, rates of expansion were weaker than in the prior month.
Commenting on the report, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said, âThe UK Manufacturing PMI fell below its critical 50.0 mark for the first time in over three years in April, highlighting a further deepening of the sectorâs downturn at the start of the second quarter.â

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 1.75 percent on Tuesday, the first easing in a year as it seeks to restrain a rising currency and stave off the creeping curse of deflation.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarter-point cut sent the local dollar down more than one U.S. cent to $0.7567 as markets wagered a further move to 1.5 percent was now likely.
Australia is just the latest in the Asian region to feel the chill of deflation as too many goods chase too little demand. Singapore surprised many by easing last month, and it followed India, Taiwan, Indonesia, China, Japan and New Zealand. 
Speculation of a possible cut flared last week when Australian government data showed inflation had slowed far more than expected in the first quarter of the year.
Underlying inflation dropped to a record low of 1.5 percent, taking it well under the RBA's long term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent and effectively pushing real rates higher. 
""Inflation has been quite low for some time and recent data were unexpectedly low,"" RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said in a brief statement after the bank's May policy meeting.
""These results, together with ongoing very subdued growth in labor costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, point to a lower outlook for inflation than previously forecast.""
Eight central banks globally have embarked on entirely new stimulus cycles so far this year while the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank have embraced sub-zero rates and expanded their asset-buying campaigns.
All this easing abroad has in turn boosted the Australian dollar further than the RBA desired, hurting exports and tourism while pushing down import prices and, hence, inflation.
UNLIKELY TO BE ""ONE AND DONE""
All of which argued for at least one cut in rates to offset these tighter financial conditions, and markets were quick to price in the possibility of a further move <0#YIB:>.
""It's hard to see how one cut by itself is going to do much,"" said Commonwealth Bank Chief Economist Michael Blythe.
""So you'd have to think the odds on a follow-up have also increased, very much tied in with how the inflation outlook evolves from here. August would be the most obvious timing.""
The easing comes just hours before the conservative government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reveals a budget that is considered crucial for his chances in a likely July election.
Normally a rate cut and lower mortgage rates would be considered a political positive in Australia. Yet this cut could also raise an awkward question - if the economy was doing as well as Turnbull claimed, why would it need lower rates?
While Australia is still struggling with the unwinding of a massive mining boom, economic activity has been generally favorable. Growth was a surprisingly brisk 3 percent for 2015 and unemployment recently fell to a 30-month low of 5.7 percent.
The RBA had also been reluctant to risk a debt-fueled bubble in the housing market, though tightened rules on investment lending has seen prices cool in recent months.
""At present, the potential risks of lower interest rates in this area are less than they were a year ago,"" Stevens said on Tuesday, providing another reason to expect further cuts.
National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) were quick to pass on the full quarter point cut to home borrowers, which could provide a new lease on life into house building and employment.

Banking stocks also took off on the prospect of increased demand for mortgages, lifting the benchmark share index (AXJO) 2.1 percent for its biggest daily rise in three months.

Here is the full-text statement:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number 2016-10Date 3 May 2016
At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 per cent, effective 4 May 2016. This follows information showing inflationary pressures are lower than expected.
The global economy is continuing to grow, though at a slightly lower pace than earlier expected, with forecasts having been revised down a little further recently. While several advanced economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate moderated further in the first part of the year, though recent actions by Chinese policymakers are supporting the near-term outlook.
Commodity prices have firmed noticeably from recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
Sentiment in financial markets has improved, after a period of heightened volatility early in the year. However, uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy settings among the major jurisdictions continues. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy is continuing to rebalance following the mining investment boom. GDP growth picked up over 2015, particularly in the second half of the year, and the labour market improved. Indications are that growth is continuing in 2016, though probably at a more moderate pace. Labour market indicators have been more mixed of late.
Inflation has been quite low for some time and recent data were unexpectedly low. While the quarterly data contain some temporary factors, these results, together with ongoing very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, point to a lower outlook for inflation than previously forecast.
Monetary policy has been accommodative for quite some time. Low interest rates have been supporting demand and the lower exchange rate overall has helped the traded sector. Credit growth to households continues at a moderate pace, while that to businesses has picked up over the past year or so. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
In reaching today's decision, the Board took careful note of developments in the housing market, where indications are that the effects of supervisory measures are strengthening lending standards and that price pressures have tended to abate. At present, the potential risks of lower interest rates in this area are less than they were a year ago.
Taking all these considerations into account, the Board judged that prospects for sustainable growth in the economy, with inflation returning to target over time, would be improved by easing monetary policy at this meeting.

792,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2016 11:30PM ET</span>",China home prices grow faster in April despite tightening in big cities,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's home prices continued to grow from a year earlier at an accelerating pace in April despite tightening housing measures introduced in big cities, two private surveys showed.
Prices of new homes in 100 cities last month rose an average 9 percent from a year earlier, a poll by property services firm China Real Estate Index System (CREIS) showed on Sunday, quickening from the 7.4 percent rise in March.
In the biggest ten cities, including Shenzhen and Shanghai, home prices were up 14.4 percent from a year ago, compared with 12.8 percent in March. The increases in Shanghai and Shenzhen come despite local authorities tightening downpayment requirements for second homes and raising the eligibility bar for non-residents in late March.
However, compared with the previous month, prices rose 1.5 percent in April, the survey showed, easing from 2.5 percent in March.
CREIS said home transaction volumes in Shenzhen and Shanghai have fallen after the tightening, and it expected the rise in prices would slow in the two cities.
A separate survey from Real Estate Information Corporation (CRIC) showed average prices in the 288 biggest cities rose 7.2 percent in April compared with a year earlier, improving from 5.6 percent increase in March.
On a monthly basis, however, prices gained 1.5 percent last month, faster than 1.2 percent in March, said CRIC, owned by E-House China Holding Ltd (N:EJ), showing smaller cities were increasingly posting price gains, helped by a slew of government measures.

While property prices in top-tier Chinese cities are booming, prices in smaller cities, where most of China's urban population lives, are still weakening, complicating government efforts to spread wealth more evenly and arrest slowing economic growth.

793,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2016 09:57PM ET</span>",Caixin PMI comes in weaker than expected in April at 49.4,"Investing.com - The Caixin Manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.4, below the 49.9 expected, and headed deeper into contraction territory.
""The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.4, down 0.3 points from March's reading. All of the index's categories indicatedconditions worsened month-on-month, with output slipping back below the 50-point neutral level. The fluctuations indicate the economy lacks a solid foundationfor recovery and is still in the process of bottoming out. The government needs to keep a close watch on the risk of a further economic downturn,"" CaixinInsight Group chief economist He Fan said.
At the weekend, the China April CFLP manufacturing index came in at 50.1, below expectations, but hanging onto expansion territory. The CFLP service PMI eased to 53.5 from 53.8.
The semi-official manufacturing PMI from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and National Bureau of Statistics slid from the first over-50 reading in eight months in March.
On the positive side, this is still the second consecutive over-50 reading - the first time that's happened since the middle of last year. Although gauges of output, new orders and export orders slipped marginally, they are still around the average of the past year.
The CFLP tried to downplay the slide in the manufacturing PMI, saying in an accompanying statement that ""the stabilizing and recovering trend of the economy remains intact. The modest drop in the index is a normal fluctuation.""
""We donât think the drop in all three PMIs in April necessarily signals a loss of economic momentum at the start of Q2,"" Capital Economic said in a note to clients.
"" The PMIs were probably given a boost in March by the re-opening of factories and business after Chinese New Year. Year-to-year shifts in the timing of the holiday mean that seasonal adjustments often do not fully iron out such effects. As a result, it arguably makes more sense to compare the latest readings with the average for Q1 as a whole. On this basis, the PMIs are consistent with a continued recovery at the start of Q2.""
""n particular, there are few signs in the latest readings that the ongoing property rebound, a key driver of the recent recovery, is losing steam. The construction component of the non-manufacturing PMI rose in April for a second straight month, from 58.0 to 59.4. Meanwhile, construction firms were the most upbeat on record on their future prospects. Price pressures also appear to be heating up, reaffirming our view that deflation fears have been overdone. All three price components of the manufacturing PMIs are now at their highest levels in over three years. The upshot is that although they missed expectations, the latest PMI readings do little to alter our view that China is in the midst of a cyclical rebound that should continue for at least another couple of quarters.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity expanded at a more moderate pace in April due in part to a slowdown in new orders, but a rise in export orders to a near 1-1/2-year high and signs an inventory overhang drag was fading offered hope for the manufacturing sector.
Another report on Monday showed construction spending rose to an 8-1/2-year high in March and the prior month's outlays were revised higher, implying a small upward revision to the first quarter's pedestrian growth rate.
""Manufacturing is moving forward but we have the tortoise, not the hare in this race,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to 50.8 last month from a reading of 51.8 in March. Despite the fall, April marked the second straight month of expansion and was also the second highest reading in the last eight months.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Economists had forecast the ISM manufacturing index dipping to 51.4 last month. 
Manufacturing has been hurt by weak export growth stemming from a strong dollar and soft global demand. 
The sector has also been hammered by relentless aggressive spending cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of last year's plunge in oil prices. Efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang have resulted in fewer factory orders, leading to further erosion in the manufacturing sector.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on Monday, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. The dollar (DXY) weakened against a basket of currencies.
Q2 GDP REBOUND EXPECTED
Manufacturing last month was held back by a drop in the gauge of orders received by factories, which fell 2.5 points to 55.8 percent. Factory production also fell last month. 
A 10th consecutive monthly decline in inventories restrained manufacturing activity in April, but represented good news for future factory output. ISM said customer inventories hit a nine-month low last month and were now regarded as being ""too low."" 
A gauge of export orders rose to its highest level since November 2014, suggesting a pickup in global demand. It also indicates the dollar's depreciation this year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners is starting to boost exports.
""This makes us hopeful that manufacturing has turned the corner and that the economy will pick up in the second quarter,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, in New York.
Economic growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Given a fairly robust labor market, which is expected to boost sluggish consumer spending, economists expect gross domestic product growth to rebound in the second quarter. 
The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.3 percent in March to its highest level since October 2007, following an upwardly revised 1.0 percent jump in February.
Construction outlays were previously reported to have declined 0.5 percent in February.
The revised February construction spending figures were much higher those used in the government's advance first-quarter GDP estimate published last week. Economists expect GDP growth for the first three months of the year will be revised up to a 0.7 percent rate.
""This morning's data indicate that residential and nonresidential structures investment will both likely be revised higher in the second estimate,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

Construction spending in March was supported by a 1.1 percent surge in private construction, which hit its highest level since October 2007. Public construction spending fell 1.9 percent in March.

Construction spending increased 0.3 percent to the highest level since October 2007, following an upwardly revised 1.0 percent jump in February, the Commerce Department said on Monday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in March after a previously reported 0.5 percent decline in February.
Construction outlays were up 8.0 percent from a year ago.
Though February's outlays were revised higher, construction spending for January was revised down to show a 0.3 percent drop instead of the previously reported 2.1 percent increase.
A drop in nonresidential construction investment helped to hold down economic growth to a meager 0.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Much of the weakness in spending on nonresidential structures reflected relentless aggressive spending cuts in the energy sector, which is reeling from last year's plunge in oil prices.
In March, construction spending was supported by a 1.1 percent surge in private construction, which hit its highest level since October 2007. Outlays on private residential construction increased 1.6 percent. Spending on private nonresidential structures, which also includes factories and offices, advanced 0.7 percent to the highest level since October 2008.

Public construction outlays fell 1.9 percent in March as outlays on state and local government construction projects, the largest portion of the public sector segment, declined 1.4 percent. Federal government construction spending tumbled 7.4 percent in March.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.2 in April, which was above the preliminary reading of 48.0 but still below a final 49.1 in March.
The index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second consecutive month and showed activity contracted the most since January 2013.
The output component of the PMI index also fell to 47.8, versus a flash reading of 47.9 a final 49.8 in the previous month to show the fastest contraction since April 2014.
On April 14, the first of several earthquakes struck Kumamoto, which damaged houses, caused landslides and halted production at electronics and car parts factories in the area.

Many companies have resumed production in Kumamoto, and economists say if this trend continues then Japan should be able to quickly shake off the impact on factory output.

808,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2016 01:06AM ET</span>",China April official factory activity expands but at slower pace,"By Jessica Macy Yu and Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING - Activity in China's manufacturing sector expanded for the second month in a row in April but only marginally, an official survey showed on Sunday, raising doubts about the sustainability of a recent pick-up in the world's second-largest economy.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 50.1 in April, easing from March's 50.2 and barely above the 50-point mark that separates expansion in activity from contraction.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the reading would improve to 50.4, after upbeat March data fueled hopes that the country's prolonged economic slowdown was easing.
The findings were ""a little bit disappointing"", Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, wrote in a note.
""To some extent, this hints that recent China enthusiasm has been a bit overpriced and the data improvement in March is short-lived.""
While production expanded modestly (52.2) and at nearly the same pace as in March, growth in domestic and export orders faded slightly, though remaining in positive territory.
In a sign of caution over the outlook, factories continued to draw down heavily on inventories of finished goods.
Factories also appeared to be stockpiling less raw materials, possibly due to recent skyrocketing price increases for products such as steel, which have been linked in part to a recovery in the property market.
Indeed, South Korea reported April demand from China was the worst in three months, with exports to its biggest market tumbling 18.4 percent on-year.
And China's factories continued to shed workers, with staff cuts quickening from the previous month. The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last 3-1/2 years.
FALSE HOPE?
March data had spurred hopes that the long suffering manufacturing sector was bottoming out, with growth in industrial output and profits improving.
That in turn had led economists to wonder if the government and central bank would begin to take a less aggressive policy approach after a more than one-year long blitz of fiscal, monetary and administrative stimulus measures.
To be sure, the property recovery appears to have spurred demand for building materials from cement and glass to steel, and a recent rebound in commodity prices is bringing in more cashflow for some companies to service their mountains of debt.
However, home sales are now tumbling in some big cities such as Shanghai as authorities try to curb rapid price rises, and sizzling steel and iron ore markets cooled last week after China's securities regulator ordered commodity futures exchanges to control speculative trading.
Analysts also worry that recent signs of improvement may be largely driven by companies and local governments taking on more debt, putting the chances of a stable recovery at risk.
China's Big Five banks reported last week that their bad loans had increased by 53.2 billion yuan ($8.21 billion) in the first quarter.
Activity in China's services industry, meanwhile, remained strong but grew at a slightly slower pace, with the official reading at 53.5 in April, compared with 53.8 in March.

Beijing is banking on a stronger services sector to help offset the long slump in ""old economy"" sectors such as heavy industry and to provide jobs for laid-off factory workers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflation barely rose in March as consumer spending remained tepid, making it less likely that the Federal Reserve will be able to follow through on its projected two interest rate increases this year. 
The tame inflation backdrop was reinforced by another government report on Friday showing a modest advance in labor costs in the first quarter.
Other data showing a drop in consumer sentiment in April, the fourth consecutive monthly decline, and a softening in factory activity in the Midwest further supported the case for a single rate hike in 2016. 
The data suggest, at least for now, that the economy will probably not rebound strongly in the second quarter after growth slowed to a crawl in the first three months of the year. 
""The tone of these reports was quite weak, playing into the current narrative of weakening growth and the subdued inflationary momentum,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""We are expecting only one rate hike this year, with that move coming in September.""
The Commerce Department reported that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in February.
The so-called core PCE, which is the U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target, rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, after advancing 1.7 percent in February. 
Following its latest policy meeting this week, the Fed said it was continuing to ""closely"" monitor inflation. It left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further.
The central bank hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade and Fed policymakers earlier this year forecast two more rate hikes for 2016. But market-based measures of Fed policy expectations mostly lean to one hike this year.
The dollar fell to an eight-month low against a basket of currencies on the data. U.S. stocks tumbled and prices for U.S. government bonds weakened marginally.
MODEST WAGE INFLATION 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent in the first quarter after gaining 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
Labor costs rose 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March, well below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's inflation target. The ECI increased 2.0 percent in the year to December.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. 
A strong dollar and lower energy prices are constraining inflation. Wage growth has been frustratingly slow and could remain moderate as the fairly robust labor market attracts people who had given up looking for work.
Though employment gains have been broad, they have tended to be concentrated in the services industries, especially restaurants and the retail sector, which typically pay less compared to manufacturing and construction jobs. 
Lack of strong wage growth has contributed to moderate consumption growth. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, ticked up 0.1 percent in March after a 0.2 percent gain in February. 
The consumer spending figures were included in Thursday's gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's 1.4 percent pace. 
With income rising 0.4 percent in March and savings jumping to a more than three-year high last month, consumer spending is expected to regain momentum. 
But households are likely to remain hesitant to loosen their purse strings in the near term, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dipped to 89.0 in April from a reading of 91.0 in March.
""There is scope for households to draw down their savings in the second quarter,"" said Steve Murphy, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""When combined with healthy employment gains, healthy balance sheets, we think the conditions are ripe for a rebound in consumption growth in the second quarter.""

In a fourth report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its Chicago business barometer declined 3.2 points to a reading of 50.4 in April as new orders fell and factory employment contracted. The report pointed to further downside risks to the troubled manufacturing sector.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter of 2016, official data showed on Friday, despite politicians failing to form a government after a December general election that did not hand a majority to any one party. 
Spain now faces an unprecedented second election in June raising fears the resulting months of lost leadership could chip away at an economic recovery and political will to pass pending structural reforms in areas like employment policy.
Output grew 0.8 percent in the January to March period, the same quarterly expansion as that registered in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute (INE), beating Reuters' and Bank of Spain forecasts of 0.7 percent.
The caretaker government of the center-right People's Party (PP) announced bullish targets for growth later on Friday at their weekly press conference, estimating the economy would grow at 2.5 percent in 2018 and 2019, comfortably above the current euro zone average.
The services industry, a huge motor for jobs especially the peak tourist season in the summer months, picked up speed in March, surveys show, with Spain's robust growth bucking the trend of weakening global expansion.
In a country hugely dependent on energy imports, tumbling oil prices worldwide have helped extend the recovery after Spain began clawing its way back from a double-dip recession in mid-2013.
A massive stimulus program from the European Central Bank has also kept a lid on borrowing costs. 
Yet signs that businesses are holding off on investments and consumer confidence is wilting have fueled concerns growth could start stalling at a time when Spain is coming under increasing pressure to reduce one of Europe's biggest public deficits. 
Spain's acting center-right government has already lowered 2016 annual growth projections to 2.7 percent from 3 percent previously, citing a weaker global climate.
Meanwhile, the economic recovery has yet to trickle down to many, and unemployment still runs at 21 percent of the workforce, fuelling discontent. 
The acting government on Friday gave optimistic forecasts that the unemployment rate would fall to 14 percent by 2019.

Opinion polls so far point to a similar deadlock in the election re-run, after December's ballot produced the most fragmented result for decades and stripped the People's Party of its majority.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. labor costs rise modestly in first quarter,"WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - - U.S. labor costs rose steadily in the first quarter as the firming jobs market struggled to generate strong wage growth, which could give the Federal Reserve more latitude to hold off on an interest rate hike until later this year.
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.5 percent gain in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
The first-quarter increase in the ECI was in line with economists' expectations. 
In the 12 months through March, labor costs rose 1.9 percent, well below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Labor costs increased 2.0 percent in the year to December.
The Fed on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The moderate labor cost reading came on the heels of a report on Thursday showing broad weakness in the economy in the first quarter. Wage growth has been frustratingly slow and could remain moderate as the fairly robust labor market attracts people who had given up the search for work.
Though employment gains have been broad, they have tended to be concentrated in the services industries, especially restaurants and the retail sector, which typically pay less compared to the manufacturing and construction sectors. 
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. 
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.7 percent in the first quarter. That was the biggest gain in a year.
They increased 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Wages and salaries were up 2.0 percent in the 12 months through March. They rose 2.1 percent in the year to December. 
Private sector wages and salaries advanced 0.7 percent in the first quarter after rising 0.6 percent in the prior quarter.

Benefits for all workers rose 0.5 percent in the first quarter after a 0.6 percent gain in the prior period.

PARIS (Reuters) - French growth accelerated more than expected at the start of the year with the strongest increase in consumer spending since 2004 and a pick-up in business investment.
The economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter, beating even the most optimistic forecast in a Reuters poll, as consumers splurged on clothes, cars and housing equipment, the INSEE national statistics agency said in a preliminary estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on Friday.
Consumer spending was up 1.2 percent over the three months, with higher spending on heating after a mild end to 2015, also offering a boost and offsetting the impact of a global slowdown that hurt exports. 
If consumers led the way in the quarter, however, economists particularly took heart in a 1.6 percent rise in business investment, the strongest increase in five years. Investment by companies in the manufacturing sector surged by 3.3 percent, the highest since the spring of 2006. 
""It's very good news, it shows companies are back on the offensive,"" said Alexandre Mirlicourtois at Xerfi.
""It gives more solid grounds to the recovery, which is not only relying on consumption.""
""The rise in fixed investment growth was particularly noteworthy,"" Raphael Brun-Aguerre of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) agreed, adding that he expected decent gains in the coming quarters.
Although a lower euro, rock-bottom interest rates and cheap energy prices have boosted French growth just like its euro zone peers, some also attribute the pick-up in investment to government measures.
Paris last year introduced the possibility for companies to write off 40 percent of their investments in productive assets, a one-off measure which was supposed to stop in April but was extended by a year.
""The expected extension of the tax write-off certainly had a positive effect,"" Economist Axelle Lacan at COE Rexecode said.
The stronger French performance also contrasted with a slowdown in the United States and Britain, which both reported lower growth than France this week.
When expressed as an annualized growth rate like the American method, French GDP rose by 2.2 percent compared with 0.5 percent in the U.S. 
France, however, has grown 3.5 percent accumulatively since its pre-crisis peak, compared with 10.2 percent for the U.S. and 7.3 percent for Britain, which was hit harder than France by the financial crisis in 2008 but rebounded more strongly.
ACCELERATION
The French reading still marked an acceleration from the 0.3 percent growth posted in the previous three months. With 1 percent of GDP carry-over at the end of March, the government's 1.5 percent growth target for the full year appears within reach, barring a sharp slowdown for the remainder of the year.
Meeting that target is important for unpopular French President Francois Hollande and his 2017 re-election bid because 1.5 percent growth is generally considered by economists as the level where unemployment starts to ebb.
The data came at the end of a week in which the number of jobless people dropped by the most since 2000, lending credence to Hollande's assertion on prime-time TV this month that ""things are getting better"".
""Solid growth has been set off,"" Finance Minister Michel Sapin said in a statement. ""Our action is bearing fruit.""
A poll of 30 analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast 0.4 percent growth for the euro zone's second-largest economy in the three months to March, with the lowest estimate at 0.1 percent and the highest at 0.4 percent. 
Domestic demand, which includes the consumer spending surge, added 0.9 points to GDP in the first quarter, up from 0.2 points in the previous one. Trade subtracted 0.2 points as both exports and imports suffered from a global slowdown.
A drawdown in business inventories also shaved 0.2 points off GDP having added 0.5 points last quarter.

Economic polled by Reuters had expected quarterly growth of 0.4 percent. On a year-on-year basis, euro zone GDP rose 1.6 percent in the first quarter, beating expectations of a 1.4 percent increase.
Eurostat does not provide a detailed breakdown of the numbers in its first GDP estimate.
Meanwhile, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in April, Eurostat said, after holding flat in March, a steeper drop than the consensus forecast for a 0.1 percent decline.
Falling energy prices, which tumbled 8.6 percent year-on-year in April, were the main drag on the overall index, while unprocessed food was the main positive, rising 1.2 percent.
Without those two most volatile items, in a measure that the European Central Bank calls core inflation -- consumer prices rose 0.8 percent year-on-year in April, less than the 1 percent increase in March.

The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term and has been buying government bonds on the market since last year to inject more cash into the economy and make prices grow faster.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter to its slowest pace in two years as consumer spending softened and a strong dollar continued to undercut exports, but a pick-up in activity is anticipated given a buoyant labor market.
Gross domestic product increased at a 0.5 percent annual rate, the weakest since the first quarter of 2014, the Labor Department said on Thursday in its advance estimate. Growth was also held back by businesses stepping up efforts to reduce unwanted merchandise clogging up warehouses. 
Cheap oil, which has pressured the profits of oil field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), remained a drag, sending business spending tumbling at its quickest pace since the second quarter of 2009, when the recession ended.
Almost all sectors of the economy weakened in the first quarter, with housing the lone star. 
""The economy essentially stalled in the first quarter, but that doesn't mean it is faltering,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Some of the restraints to growth are dissipating. Growth is likely to accelerate going forward."" 
The dollar's rally is largely over, oil prices appear to be stabilizing and the bulk of the inventory liquidation is out of the way. In addition, the jobs market remains fairly robust.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week and the four-week average of initial claims fell to its lowest level since 1973.
Employment gains averaged 209,000 jobs per month in the first quarter. Also suggesting a pickup in growth in the second quarter, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys, which are closely correlated to economic activity, rebounded in recent months.
While the Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged economic activity had ""slowed,"" it also said labor market conditions had ""improved further."" The U.S. central bank appeared to view the threats from the global economy and financial markets as having diminished. 
The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Economists had forecast the economy expanding at a 0.7 percent rate in the January-March period after growing at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Bank of Japan's decision overnight to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The dollar fell against the yen and U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower. Prices for U.S. government debt slipped.
SEASONAL QUIRK
Though the weakness in growth last quarter was broad-based, economists believe the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite steps last year to address the problem. 
Residual seasonality has plagued first-quarter GDP, with growth underperforming in five of the last six years since the recovery started in mid-2009.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 1.9 percent rate. That was the slowest in a year and marked a deceleration from the fourth quarter's 2.4 percent rate.
Households have been frugal, cutting back on purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods like automobiles, despite cheap gasoline, as they sock away modest wage gains and the gasoline savings. They have also reduced their debt.
Income at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 2.9 percent in the first quarter after rising 2.3 percent in the prior period. Savings rose to a lofty $712.3 billion from $678.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
""Consumer spending will rebound in the second quarter on the basis of solid growth in income and lower energy costs, which are an under-appreciated tailwind that could offset much of the drag from weak global growth,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Businesses continued to place fewer orders for goods in the first quarter, accumulating $60.9 billion worth of inventory, down from $78.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
The small inventory build cut 0.33 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. 
Trade subtracted 0.34 percentage point from GDP growth, with dollar strength weighing on exports and sucking in imports. 
The dollar gained 20 percent versus the currencies of the United States' trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015. So far this year the dollar is down 2.6 percent on a trade- weighted basis.
A sustained plunge in energy sector investment undermined business spending. Equipment spending tumbled at an 8.6 percent rate, the steepest decline since the second quarter of 2009. 
Investment in nonresidential structures dropped at a 10.7 percent pace as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts collapsed at a record 86 percent rate after contracting at a 39.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Economists said sluggish business spending suggested productivity will remain weak.

""It makes no sense that companies slashed capital spending but boosted payrolls in the first quarter,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Â ""The data portend another very weak productivity report for the quarter.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer prices unexpectedly fell in April, data showed on Thursday, illustrating the scale of the task the European Central Bank faces in trying to propel inflation back to its target range.
The euro zone has struggled with little or no inflation for the past year and the ECB expects the bloc-wide figure to turn negative again before slowly ticking up, undershooting its goal of just under 2 percent for years to come.
The ECB unveiled a surprisingly large stimulus package in March but falling inflation expectations have fueled expectations of even more easing, possibly as early as June, when the bank's staff present new growth and inflation forecasts.
""It might be hard for some German ECB critics to digest, but if the strongest euro zone economy with low unemployment does not show any signs of inflationary pressures, the ECB after all might have a point in continuing its ultra-loose monetary policy,"" ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said.
Separate data on Thursday showed unemployment unexpectedly fell in April, with the jobless rate remaining at its lowest in more than 25 years. 
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), fell by 0.1 percent on the year after a 0.1 percent rise in March, the Federal Statistics Office said. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a zero reading.
On a non-harmonized basis, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent on the month and inched up 0.1 percent on the year. A breakdown showed energy remained the main drag while the food, services and rental costs increased at a slower pace.
Analysts said the German data suggested that the April inflation rate for the whole euro zone, due out on Friday, would also turn negative again.
Economists polled by Reuters so far expect a reading of -0.1 percent, down from 0.0 percent in March.
""German inflation is likely to remain very weak over the next couple of months before energy (base) effects push it to around 1.5 percent by year-end,"" Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said.
Due to the economic upswing and the robust labor market, price pressures in Germany are not as weak as elsewhere in the euro zone. Still, inflation expectations are very subdued and wage growth has slowed recently.
""Even in the euro zone's largest and arguably strongest economy, inflation seems unlikely to reach the ECB's near 2 percent target over the medium term,"" McKeown said. The weak data was adding to pressure on the ECB to do more, she added.

On Wednesday, ECB policymakers played down the need for more near-term stimulus, calling for people to wait for existing measures to take effect.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 257,000 for the week ended April 23, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 more applications than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 260,000 in the latest week. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 60 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and no states had
been estimated. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,750 to 256,000 last week, the lowest since December 1973.
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 5,000 to 2.13 million in the week ended April 16, the lowest since November 2000. 
The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims declined 10,500 to 2.16 million, the lowest reading since November 2000. The continuing claims data covered the survey week for April's unemployment rate. 
The four-week average of continuing claims fell 47,750 between the March and April survey periods, suggesting an improvement in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate was at 5.0 percent in March.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2016 08:35PM ET</span>",Japan consumer prices fall at fastest in 3 years before BOJ meeting ,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's consumer prices fell in March at the fastest pace in three years and household spending declined at the fastest pace in a year, keeping the Bank of Japan under pressure to implement more stimulus to support the economy.
Separate data showed industrial output rose more than expected and labor demand rose to the highest in two decades, but renewed worries about weak private consumption are likely to temper any optimism about the economy.
The BOJ is likely to debate expanding monetary stimulus at a policy meeting ending later on Thursday, as sluggish global demand hurts exports and weak wage growth undermines private consumption, sources have told Reuters..
""Oil prices falls and the waning effect from a weak yen pushed down core CPI,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""We expect the BOJ will ease policy today. It will probably be difficult politically for the BOJ to further cut negative interest rates, so we expect the central bank will focus on qualitative easing such as increasing ETF buying.""
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.3 percent in March from a year earlier, more than the median forecast for a 0.2 percent annual decline.
That marked the fastest decline since April 2013 due to lower prices for gasoline and slowing gains in prices for durable goods and overseas travel.
The core-core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.7 percent in the year to March, slower than a 0.8 percent annual increase in the previous month.
Household spending in March fell 5.3 percent from a year earlier due to lower spending on clothes, leisure activities and gasoline. That was more than the median estimate for a 4.2 percent annual decline and marked the fastest decline since March 2015.
In one positive sign, industrial production rose 3.6 percent in March from the previous month, compared with a 2.9 percent increase forecast by economists.
The jobs-applicants ratio also rose to 1.30 in March, which shows labor demand is the strongest since December 1991 when the ratio was 1.31.
Any attempts by the BOJ to push down already low yields may anger financial institutions still struggling to adjust to January's negative rates decision.

Cutting the rate on excess reserves from the current minus 0.1 percent or providing funds to banks at a negative rate may thus prove difficult, some analysts say.

It followed a revised 5.2 percent drop in February, hurt by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia and Toyota Motor Corp's temporary halting of factory output due to an explosion at a steel plant.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank left interest rates at a near 10-year high on Wednesday in a bid to ease inflation in what could be the current board's last decision ahead of a likely change in government.
The bank's board, known as Copom, unanimously voted to keep its benchmark Selic interest rate at 14.25 percent for the sixth straight time as widely expected by economists and traders. At its last meeting, two of the eight members of the bank's board voted to raise rates by 50 basis points.
A recent slowdown in inflation had raised pressure on the central bank to cut some of the world's highest interest rates to ease the pain from what is the country's worst recession in a century.
Still, the bank signaled rate cuts were not yet imminent.
""High twelve-month inflation and inflation expectations far from the official targets offer no room for the easing of monetary policy,"" the bank said in its decision statement. The bank completely changed its statement when compared to that of its previous meeting, saying it has had some progress in controlling inflation.
Analysts interpreted the vote to hold rates after three previous split decisions as a sign policymakers are gearing up to ease monetary policy later this year.
""Overall it is a hawkish statement, in which the bank acknowledges progress in fighting inflation but still not enough for them to ease policy,"" said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
The bank's current board of mostly career technocrats could be replaced if Vice President Michel Temer becomes president, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Market analysts have accused President Dilma Rousseff of pressuring the central bank to not make further rate hikes. In Brazil, the central bank has administrative autonomy but is not completely independent.
The bank, under the leadership of Alexandre Tombini since 2011, has been under fire for years for being too tolerant of high inflation.
Slower inflation stemming from a drop in government-controlled prices and dwindling consumption had raised bets the central bank could start a new easing cycle in the second half of the year.

Brazil's inflation rate slowed sharply in March to below 10 percent a year, the lowest in nine months, but it is still well above the 4.5 percent center of the official target range.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit narrowed sharply to a one-year low in March, as both imports and exports fell, suggesting economic growth in the first-quarter was probably not as weak as currently anticipated.
The Commerce Department said in its advance report on Wednesday that the goods trade gap tumbled 10.3 percent to $56.90 billion last month, the smallest deficit since February 2015. 
While the improvement suggested there could be an upside surprise in gross domestic product growth for the first quarter, the weakness in both imports and exports is worrying as it implies softening global and domestic demand.
""Notwithstanding the improvement in the deficit, which signals a diminished drag on domestic GDP, the broad-based falloff in both exports and imports activity is a sobering sign of some weakening in domestic and global demand,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Goods imports fell 4.4 percent to $173.6 million last month, outpacing a 1.2 percent drop in exports. March's comprehensive trade report, which includes services, will be released next Wednesday. The advance goods trade data will be included in Thursday's snapshot of first-quarter GDP growth.
Economists polled by Reuters have forecast GDP rising at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its overnight benchmark interest rate unchanged citing weak economic growth and tame inflation. The U.S. central bank's statement accompanying the decision implied that it was in no hurry to follow on from its December rate hike. 
The dollar was trading weaker against a basket of currencies, but off earlier lows. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while U.S. stocks trimmed losses.
UPSIDE RISK
""It (goods deficit) suggests that first-quarter GDP growth will be much stronger than we previously believed,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
""We now estimate that first-quarter GDP growth was 1.4 percent annualized, whereas we previously thought it would be only 0.8 percent.""
Imports fell broadly last month, with consumer goods plunging 9.7 percent and capital goods declining 3.2 percent.
The economy has been hurt by the lingering effects of the dollar's rally last year and sluggish global demand, which have eroded exports. Weak business spending, especially in the troubled energy sector, and ongoing efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang have also acted as a drag. 
A separate report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes rose 1.4 percent in March to a 10-month high. These contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase pointed to a further pick-up in home resales in April.
Housing continues to be a bright spot in the economy, driven by a strong labor market. But a shortage of properties for sale, which is limiting choices for buyers and driving up prices, remains a constraint.

""The buying season is off to a good start that should ensure we indeed see the best year of total sales in a decade,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com in Washington.

880,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2016 02:46PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve leaves rates unchanged for third straight meeting,"Investing.com -- As expected, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, marking the third straight meeting the U.S. central bank has held rates steady in 2016.
In a relatively neutral April monetary policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. It represented the first rate hike by the Fed in nearly a decade.
In determining the size of future adjustments to the Federal Funds Rate, the FOMC said it will assess economic conditions, measures of labor market conditions, indications of inflationary pressures and expectations, as well as readings on financial and international developments. Since the FOMC last met in March, the central bank noted that economic activity has slowed in recent weeks.
While the Fed has expressed optimism with continued improvements in the labor market, the U.S. central bank has remained concerned with sluggishly low inflation in recent months. As oil prices hover near multi-year lows and the dollar remains markedly above its 2014 levels, long-term inflation has fallen under the Fed's 2% objective in every month over the last three years.
At the start of the year, however, there have been some signals that inflation is beginning to firm. In January, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index nearly doubled to 1.3%, hitting its highest level since the fall of 2014. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, soared to 1.7%, its strongest annual gain since the end of 2012. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, increased by 1.7% in both January and February. Further increases in inflation could compel the FOMC to lift interest rates in June.
Following the release, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 18,019.98, up 0.16% on the day, while the S&P 500 Composite index moved into positive territory for the session at 2,092.60, up 0.05% on the day. Both indices were relatively flat before the Fed issued its statement.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other currencies, ticked up 0.03% to reach 94.48, reversing its course following the rate decision. EUR/USD pared some gains to 1.1314 (up 0.15%), while yields on the U.S. 10-Year inched up one basis point to 1.90%. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries were still on pace to post their first losing session since April 17.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed at the start of this year, buffeted by a slowing global economy and uncertainty ahead of this year's referendum on European membership, as it relied solely on the services sector to drive growth.
First-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.4 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the three months to December 2015 and in line with economists' forecasts of a 0.4 percent expansion, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
Economists were clear that the weak global economy and doubts about Britain's future in Europe had contributed to the slowdown.
""Given that the next quarter is also likely to see some pre-referendum jitters, it looks likely that Q2 will see a soft reading for GDP growth,"" said Martin Beck, economist from the EY ITEM Club consultancy. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Wednesday warned that Britain's large current account deficit could become harder to finance and sterling might slide if it votes to leave the EU.
Sterling climbed from a day's low against the dollar after the data came in no worse than expected by economists.
While the ONS said it had no evidence for or against a link between the slowdown and referendum uncertainty, business surveys suggest it is taking a toll on activity and investment.
The preliminary reading of gross domestic product does not include measures like investment and trade that would more readily reflect Brexit-related uncertainty, or a slowing global economy. 
Output in the three months to March was 2.1 percent higher than a year earlier, matching the fourth quarter's growth rate that was also the weakest since the third quarter of 2013, but it was still slightly stronger than expected by economists.
The Bank of England has said that interpreting economic data in the run-up to the referendum is likely to be tricky but it has pointed to signs that uncertainty around the Brexit vote is weighing on business investment.
The soft outlook for the world economy, combined with a slowdown in British wage growth, has prompted economists to push back their bets on when the Bank of England will raise rates into next year.
Growth in the first quarter was driven solely by the services sector, which expanded 0.6 percent compared with the fourth quarter. By contrast, industrial and construction output declined 0.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.
Manufacturing and construction output suffered the steepest drops in annual terms since early 2013. 
While consumer demand - a key pillar of British economic growth - has remained broadly solid, retail sales dropped at the joint-fastest rate in March since January 2014, adding to signs of a slowdown.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to rise to 50.4 in April from 50.2 in March, according to a median forecast of 28 economists polled.
Such a level would be the highest since October 2014, but it may be too early to tell if the rebound is simply seasonal or something more sustainable.
While slightly stronger than March, the April forecast is still not far above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion in activity from contraction.
A more robust reading could reinforce views that policymakers can now take a less aggressive stance after a more than one-year blitz of fiscal and monetary stimulus. 
To be sure, economists believe the long suffering manufacturing sector is beginning to benefit from a recovery in the property market, which is boosting demand for materials from cement to steel.
China's property investment growth quickened to 6.2 percent in the first three months of 2016 as national sales growth accelerated to a near three-year high on a range of official stimulus measures. 
Exports also returned to growth in March for the first time in nine months, though global demand still appears stubbornly sluggish.
""The pick-up in recent activity is underpinned by the real estate sector and the de-stocking of the property market,"" said Raymond Yeung, a Hong Kong-based economist with ANZ Bank. 
Strong loan growth and a recovery in prices of some raw materials such as steel and iron ore may also have been factors, he said. 
Profits earned by China's industrial companies rose 11.1 percent in March from a year earlier, accelerating from the January-February period, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. 
First-quarter profit gains were largely led by chemical companies and agricultural and food processing companies, but ""old economy"" heavy industry and mining continued to struggle, with ferrous metal smelting and rolling firms seeing profits fall.
The official manufacturing PMI data will be released on May 1, along with the official services PMI. 

The Markin/Caixin factory PMI, a private and separate gauge of manufacturing activity, will be released on May 3.

March's gap was largely led by a $19.1 billion gulf in spending between Chinese who spent more abroad than foreign tourists did in China, data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) showed.
In the first three months, the services trade deficit stood at $57.7 billion yuan. 

China had a $24.6 billion surplus on trade of goods in March, according to SAFE data.

A Reuters poll of nine economists had an average forecast of 95. The highest forecast was 96 and the lowest was 93. 

The index, which is not closely correlated to consumer spending trends, hit an all-time low in May and June 2013 of 79. The highest level since the survey was conducted on a monthly basis was 125 in January 2001.

The GfK consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to 9.7 heading into May from 9.4 a month earlier.
This was the highest reading since September 2015 and beat the Reuters consensus forecast for the headline figure to remain stable at 9.4.
""The mood among German consumers has hardly ever been better,"" said Rolf Buerkl, a researcher for Nuremberg-based GfK, adding that consumers were expecting another pay hike this year due to the solid labor market and record-high employment.
The GfK survey showed that consumers were more upbeat about their earnings for the next 12 months, with the index for income expectations rising by seven points to 57.5. This was the highest level since July 2015.
The willingness to buy improved by more than five points to 55.4 while consumers' expectations for the overall economic development brightened by nearly six points to 6.3.
Buerkl pointed to the decision by the government to raise pension entitlements by more than four percent in the West and nearly six percent in the East. ""Coupled with the low inflation, this means additional purchasing power,"" he noted.
The propensity to save fell to the lowest level on record after the European Central Bank's decision in March to further loosen monetary policy. ""The ECB's record-low interest rates are indirectly pushing up the willingness to buy,"" Buerkl noted.
The German economy expanded by 1.7 percent in 2015, its strongest rate in four years, driven by robust private consumption and higher state spending on refugees. It is
expected to grow by around the same amount this year.

Consumers' purchasing power is being boosted by factors such as record-high employment, rising real wages, rock-bottom interest rates and falling car fuel costs.

The Labour Ministry said that the number of people registered as out of work in mainland France fell by 60,000 to 3,531,000 in March, down 1.7 percent over one month, but still up 0.5 percent over one year.
The monthly decrease, the biggest since September 2000, more than reversed a spike in the jobless total the previous month to a new record high amid recent volatility in monthly figures that the government says is typical when a recovery takes root.
Economist Bruno Ducoudre with the OFCE think-tank said that even though the labor market has been showing signs of recovery, it was not yet enough to boost consumer confidence.
""We're coming back from a really low level,"" he said. ""It will take years to get back to levels seen before the crisis and the improvement is not really enough for households to take note.""
The monthly jobless report does not include an unemployment rate, but it remains stuck above 10 percent, according to the last figures published at the end of last year.
Though the ministry's headline number marked a sharp improvement, the Labour Ministry's figures showed much of the decline stemmed from people dropping out of the jobless toll because they had not updated their job-seeking status.
The monthly report on joblessness, which does not include an unemployment rate, also showed that the number of partially unemployed people rose to a new high while the average time jobless people spent unemployed reached a new record of 580 days.
Hollande's popularity has plumbed new lows for a modern French president as he failed to live up to a promise to get unemployment falling.
He has said he would not run for re-election in a presidential vote a year away unless France makes headway against unemployment. 
Hollande said on prime-time television this month that his policies were beginning to bear fruit and gave himself until the end of the year to decide whether to seek re-election.
Labour Minister Myriam El Khomri said that hiring by small and mid-sized firms was surging as they signed up to receive recently announced government payouts for taking on workers.
But the Medef employers associations urged her in a statement to stop diluting a labor market reform bill under pressure from unions and students who have held a series protests against it.

Parliament is due to begin considering the bill on May 3.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2016 10:54PM ET</span>",Stronger China March industrial profits add to economic recovery hopes,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies rose 11.1 percent in March from a year earlier, adding to signs that the country's economic slowdown may be bottoming out.
Industrial profits rose to 561.24 billion yuan ($86.50 billion) in March, the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS) said on its website on Wednesday.
That brought total first-quarter profits to 1.34 trillion yuan, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier and improving from a 4.8 percent rise in the January-February period.
The data covers large enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.
The first-quarter gains were largely led by chemical companies and agricultural and food processing companies, which posted 20.8 percent and 12.1 percent growth compared with the same period a year earlier.
But heavy industry and mining continued to struggle, with ferrous metal smelting and rolling firms seeing profits fall 15.8 percent in the quarter and profits for coal miners slumping 92.6 percent. Oil and gas producers posted a loss.
Debt at Chinese industrial companies increased 5.2 percent on a yearly basis to 55.22 trillion yuan as of end-March, the bureau said.
China's economy grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter this year from a year earlier, its slowest pace in seven years, but beter-than-expected consumer, investment and factory data have fueled hopes that the economy's prolonged downturn may be easing.
Still, analysts are worried that the improvement may be largely driven by companies taking on more debt, raising questions about whether the seeming pick-up in the broader economy can be sustained. 
Adding to that caution, the statistics bureau warned that profits from investment and non-core activities ""increased dramatically"", and that the rise in profits was not seen across the industrial spectrum. 
The bureau said that 30.5 percent of industrial profits in March stemmed from investments and non-core activities.
""The pickup in March industrial profits was partly due to an improving economy, but it was not a balanced and stable recovery,"" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.
Slowing demand, high inventories and financing difficulties still trouble the sector, he added, and it remains to be seen whether the increase in profits is sustainable.
Producer prices in March fell 4.3 percent from a year earlier, extending their decline to a full four years, but at a slower rate than a median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 4.6 percent decline.
Economists said the slower fall in producer prices was driven by recovering global commodity prices and also an uptick in construction activity at home.
Premier Li Keqiang said at a State Council meeting last week that China will take steps to boost exports, including encouraging banks to boost lending, expanding export credit insurance and raise tax rebates for some firms.

Profits at China's state-owned firms fell 13.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, though the rate of decline eased slightly from the first two months of the year, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rebounded far less than expected in March as demand for automobiles, computers and electrical goods slumped, suggesting the downturn in the factory sector was far from over.
Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department also implied that business spending and economic growth were weak in the first quarter. Prospects for the second quarter darkened after another report showed an ebb in consumer confidence in April. 
The data came as Federal Reserve officials started a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged on Wednesday. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
""These disappointing reports will likely add to the caution at the Fed. Given the weak performance in these two key segments of the economy, we expect the rebound in growth momentum in the second quarter to be quite weak,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, increased 0.8 percent last month after declining 3.1 percent in February. 
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, were unchanged after a downwardly revised 2.7 percent decrease in the prior month. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have decreased 2.5 percent in February. Economists had forecast durable goods orders advancing 1.8 percent last month and core capital goods increasing 0.8 percent. Shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report â rose 0.3 percent after slumping 1.8 percent in February. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of the dollar's past surge and sluggish overseas demand.
Factories also have been hurt by deep spending cuts on capital projects by oilfield service firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL) as well as efforts by businesses to sell a stockpile of unwanted inventory.
These drags have rippled through the economy, undercutting export growth, business investment and profits.
WEAK FIRST QUARTER
The durable goods report added to recent reports on retail sales, trade and industrial production in suggesting economic growth slowed further in the first quarter. The economy grew at an anemic 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
First-quarter GDP growth estimates are as low as a 0.3 percent rate. The government will publish its advance first-quarter GDP growth estimate on Thursday.
A second report on Tuesday from the Conference Board showed its consumer confidence index fell 1.9 points to a reading of 94.2 in April. Consumers were a bit pessimistic on the economy's short-term prospects, implying they did not expect a pick-up in activity. 
Households' views of the labor market were mixed this month. The share of consumers who believed jobs were ""plentiful"" slipped, while those who said employment was ""hard to get"" fell.
The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt were trading lower, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed. 
Labor market strength has helped support the housing market, despite distress in the industrial sector. A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased a solid 5.4 percent in February from a year ago.
While most manufacturing surveys have painted a fairly upbeat picture of the sector in recent months as a dollar rally fizzled, so-called hard data such as industrial production and factory orders have remained depressed. 
There had been hope that manufacturing was regaining its footing as the dollar weakened, oil prices stabilized and the inventory drawdown drew to close.
The dollar is down 2.7 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners so far this year, after gaining 20 percent between June 2014 and December 2015.
""Although this month's flattening in core capital goods orders suggests we may have reached a bottom, the overall tone of the report suggests we are not yet seeing a reacceleration in the sector,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The rise in durable goods orders last month was led by a65.7 percent jump in defense aircraft orders, which lifted bookings for transportation equipment 2.9 percent. There were also increases in orders for primary metals and machinery. 

But orders for civilian aircraft, computers and electronic products fell as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components. With demand for autos softening in recent months after sales hit a record high in 2015, orders for motor vehicles and parts tumbled in March.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 94.2 this month from a reading of 96.1 in March, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 96.2. Analysts expected the index to inch down to 96.0 in April.
The Present Situation Index increased from 114.9 to 116.4, while the Expectations Index decreased from 83.6 to 79.3 in April.
Commenting on the report, director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center Lynn Franco said, âConsumersâ assessment of current conditions improved, suggesting no slowing in economic growth. However, their expectations regarding the short-term have moderated, suggesting they do not foresee any pickup in momentum.â

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew 0.4 percent in January-March over the previous quarter, the central bank estimated on Tuesday, slightly below expectations and with growth almost halving from the fourth quarter of 2015.
First quarter growth was the slowest seen since the second quarter of last year due to poor exports and stumbling capital investment.
Sequential growth lagged a median forecast from a Reuters survey of 0.5 percent, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and was below the 0.7 percent rise in the fourth quarter. The forecasts from 17 analysts had ranged from 0.3 percent to 1.8 percent.
""We may see more of a slowdown in the second half of the year but for now, the second quarter will improve on base effects. This will prompt the Bank of Korea to save its bullets for later,"" said Stephen Lee, economist at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities, referring to the central bank possibly cutting interest rates from the current 1.50 percent.
A majority of analysts currently see the BOK lowering rates soon to prop up economic growth, which Lee says may take place later than some expect as the central bank will want to observe the fallout from ongoing structural reform.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 2.7 percent in the March quarter, which matched a median 2.7 percent forecast in the Reuters poll.
As expected, capital investment dropped 5.9 percent in the March quarter after rising 0.5 percent in the final three months of 2015. It was the worst performance for the sector since the second quarter of 2012 as companies remained hesitant to invest amid global uncertainties.
Exports, which were also widely expected to have placed a drag on growth along with facilities investment, slipped 1.7 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, in seasonally adjusted terms.
Private consumption notched its first fall in nearly a year, falling 0.3 percent on-quarter. This was the sharpest decline since the June quarter of 2014.
In the first quarter, construction and government spending managed to keep growth from reeling off the tracks.
Construction investment jumped by a seasonally adjusted 5.9 percent from a 2.4 percent decline in the December quarter. Government spending rose 1.3 percent on-quarter, thanks to traditional frontloading of the government budget towards the start of the year.

The central bank has said although weakness was detected early in the year, the economy is expected to improve beyond the second quarter as the global economy and oil prices rebound.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2016 12:28PM ET</span>",New U.S. home sales drop on sharp decline in the West,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in March, but the decline was concentrated in the West region, suggesting that the housing market continued to steadily improve.
The Commerce Department said on Monday new home sales decreased 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 511,000 units. February's sales pace was revised up to 519,000 units from the previously reported 512,000 units. 
New home sales are volatile month-to-month because they are drawn from a small sample. While sales have now declined for three straight months, this likely does not signal a slowdown in the housing market given a buoyant labor market.
""Through some of the short-lived ups and downs in the data, it still appears that new home sales are trending higher over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 8.7 percent of the housing market, rising to a 520,000 unit-rate in March. New home sales surged 18.5 percent in the Midwest and climbed 5.0 percent in the populous South. 
But sales plunged 23.6 percent in the West, reversing February's 21.7 percent jump, and were flat in the Northeast. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to kept its short-term interest rates unchanged, but its statement accompanying the rate decision will be scrutinized for clues on the near-term outlook for monetary policy.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was down 0.78 percent as shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), dropped 1.25 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.61 percent.
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS
A report last week showed a 5.1 percent surge in sales of previously owned homes in March.
The housing market is bucking a broadly weak economy, with data such as trade, industrial production, business spending and retail sales suggesting the economy lost considerable momentum in the first quarter after logging a 1.4 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter.
First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are as low as a 0.3 percent rate. The government will release the advance first-quarter GDP estimate on Thursday. 
The demand for housing is being fueled by the robust labor market, characterized by the lowest unemployment benefit claims since 1973, and mortgage rates near record lows. Labor market strength has increased employment opportunities for young adults, boosting household formation.
""With continued improvement in the labor market leading to higher incomes, and borrowing costs that remain low, the fundamentals remain supportive. We expect new home sales to advance throughout 2016,"" said Kristin Reynolds, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
But a shortage of properties for sale, which is limiting choice for buyers and driving up prices, remains a constraint for the housing market. 
While the inventory of new homes on the market rose in March to the highest since September 2009, new housing stock remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing bubble.

At March's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market. That was the most since last September and was up from 5.6 months in February.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale unexpectedly dipped in April, a survey showed on Monday, with global growth concerns prompting firms to tone down a generally optimistic outlook they had pegged on a solid start to 2016 for Europe's biggest economy.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Monday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, inched down to 106.6 in April from 106.7 in March.
Ifo said the reading was still well above the survey's long-term average, but it was also the fourth fall in five months and below a Reuters consensus forecast of 107.0.
""The mood in the German economy is good but not euphoric,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said, citing concerns about weakening exports -- traditionally Germany's main growth driver -- linked to a slowdown in the United States and China.
The overall drop was driven by a deterioration in sentiment in the wholesale and retail sectors, while the climate in manufacturing and construction improved.
Recent data have painted an upbeat picture of the German economy, with industrial output stronger than expected at the beginning of the year and exports bouncing back in February.
This has raised hopes for an accelerated economic upswing. Germany's leading economic institutes predict the quarterly growth rate will double to 0.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous one.
SUSTAINABLE MODEL?
ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the reading suggested fears of a sharp global slowdown seemed exaggerated, pointing to domestic resilience in the German economy.
However, with manufacturing still struggling to gain momentum and German companies losing competitiveness, it was unclear if the economy's new consumption-based growth model was sustainable, he added.
""Under the surface of solid hard data, a more worrying picture is emerging,"" Brzeski said.
""The economy is no longer driven by the old success formula but by new factors: consumption, construction and services.""
The German industry federation BDI said the success of the sector is increasingly dependent on external factors such as cheap oil, historically low interest rates and the weak euro. It urged the government to boost investment on infrastructure.
""The federal government has neglected to make Germany watertight in the past years,"" BDI head Ulrich Grillo told a news conference at the Hannover Messe trade fair.
""At the moment our recovery is driven above all by strong consumption,"" he said. ""If these external factors stop working our economic house of cards could collapse.""
With robust private consumption and higher state spending having replaced exports as the main pillar of growth, the government expects an expansion of 1.7 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017. The German economy grew by 1.7 percent in 2015.
German first quarter gross domestic product data is due on May 13.

Grillo said the BDI now expected German GDP growth of 1.5 to just under 2 percent for 2016, down from its previous forecast of almost 2 percent, confirming comments he made to a German newspaper last week.

Inflation in the 12 months through mid-April was 2.60 percent, the national statistics institute said on Friday, below a forecast 2.71 percent rate in a Reuters poll and up from 2.49 percent in the second half of March.
Mexico's central bank expects inflation to rise slightly above its 3 percent target sometime in 2016, but fall back toward the target by the end of the year.
Last month, the central bank held its main interest rate at 3.75 percent, but warned it could raise borrowing costs if a weak peso begins to push up inflation expectations.
The bank hiked rates in February and December after a deep slump in the peso, but the currency has recovered somewhat in the past two months.

Power and LMC Automotive on Thursday said April U.S. total light vehicle sales will rise 4.9 percent to 1.523 million vehicles, for an annualized rate of 17.6 million vehicles.
The two auto industry consultants said consumers are expected to spend $36.9 billion on new vehicles in April, compared with $35.3 billion last April.
Retail sales, or sales to individual consumers, will rise 3.9 percent to 1.195 million vehicles in April, the consultancies said. Retail sales do not include fleet sales, which are volume sales to rental agencies, government and businesses.
Many auto analysts see retail sales as a better barometer of consumer spending than total light vehicle sales.
Each month, auto sales are seen as an early indicator of U.S. consumer spending.

J.D. Power and LMC maintained their forecast for 2016 total light vehicle sales at 17.8 million vehicles. This would be a new record, topping last year's record U.S. auto sales which were 17.4 million according to WardsAuto.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, hitting its lowest level since 1973, suggesting an apparent sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter could be temporary.
While another report on Thursday showed a mild weakening in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in April, manufacturers were fairly upbeat about business prospects in the next six months. This, together with labor market buoyancy bodes well for a pick-up in economic growth in the second quarter.
""The labor market continues to improve. If the apparent slowing in GDP in the first quarter was truly a sudden change in trend, we should have seen something happen in claims by now,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended April16, the lowest reading since November 1973, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to263,000 in the latest week. 
Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 59 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. Labor market strength comes despite signs that growth stumbled in the first quarter. 
The economy has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have eroded exports. Lower oil prices are also a constraint, as they have undercut the profits of energy firms, forcing them to slash spending on capital projects. 
There is also a tendency for reported growth to weaken in the first three months of the year because of measurement challenges, which have been acknowledged by the government. 
First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are currently as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
STRENGTHENING LABOR MARKET 
With growth weak and inflation benign, labor market strength is probably not enough to nudge the Federal Reserve away from its policy of raising interest rates at a gradual pace.
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index fell to -1.6 this month from a reading of 12.4 in March. But the survey's indicators of future activity showed continued improvement - with rising expectations for increases in orders, shipments and factory jobs.
The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. U.S. stocks were little changed.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,500 to 260,500 last week.
The claims report covered the survey week for April non farm payrolls. The four-week average of claims rose 1,000 between the March and April survey periods, implying another strong month of employment gains. Payrolls increased 215,000 in March. 
""This continued strength in the labor market supports our forecast for a modest rebound in consumer spending growth in the second quarter, but it also suggests that wage and inflation pressures will continue to build,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 39,000 to 2.14 million in the week ended April 9, the lowest level since November 2000. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims was also the lowest since November 2000.

The four-week moving average was 260,500, a decline of 4,500 from the previous week's unrevised figure of 265,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's budget deficit has overshot Chancellor George Osborne's target and retail sales fell sharply in March, adding to signs of a slowing economy, according to data released on Thursday.
Underscoring the challenge Osborne faces as he tries to turn a still large budget shortfall into a surplus by the end of the decade, public borrowing, excluding banks, came in at 74.0 billion pounds in the 2015/16 tax year.
The deficit was slightly above the 72.2 billion-pound forecast set for Osborne by Britain's fiscal watchdog and economists said Thursday's figure might eventually be revised lower.
""However, the key question is how well economic growth will hold up over the next year or two. This will be the main determinant of tax revenue growth and so future public borrowing levels,"" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said.
The shortfall was equivalent to 3.9 percent of national economic output, down from 5.0 percent in the 2014/15 year.
The Office for National Statistics also said retail sales volumes dropped 1.3 percent on the month in March, a bigger fall than any of the forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and matching the biggest fall since January 2014.
Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in the first three months of 2016, the weakest calendar quarter in a year.
British consumers have driven the economy over the past three years, buoyed by record employment, rising wages and near-zero inflation. But signs of weakness have appeared recently.
The Bank of England has said the economy is suffering from uncertainty about the outcome of a June 23 referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, as well as headwinds from weakness in many emerging markets.
The slowdown has become a headache for Osborne. In his March budget statement, Osborne admitted defeat on one of his key fiscal goals - reducing national debt as a share of GDP each year - as an economic slowdown weighed on tax receipts.
He later had to reverse plans to cut disability benefits, complicating the task of hitting by a budget surplus by 2020.
After the latest budget deficit data was released on Thursday, the country's debt office raised slightly the amount of government debt it plans to sell this year.
Osborne has prioritized fixing the public finances since he became finance minister in 2010 when the deficit exceeded 10 percent of GDP. But progress has been slowed by weak economic growth, in part due to problems in the euro zone. Some economists say his austerity plan has been counterproductive.

There were some encouraging signs for him in the data. Public spending growth last year was just 0.3 percent, its lowest since comparable records began in 1997, and the amount of money raised from income tax and social security contributions rose 4.2 percent, its fastest rate since the financial crisis.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2016 06:10PM ET</span>","German economy grew robustly in first, outlook mixed: finance ministry","BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is expected to have grown robustly in the first quarter led by private consumption and state spending, but the outlook for the rest of the year is less clear, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday.
Growth in the first three months was driven by private consumption and state spending, it said in its monthly report, adding that overall tax income rose 7.1 percent year on year in March.
Prospects for the rest of the year were mixed, notably given uncertainties about global growth and security and the impact of a huge influx of migrants.
""A further lack of clarity concerning the growth outlooks in emerging economies as well as a deterioration of geopolitical conflicts would particularly impact German exporters because of their product ranges,"" the report said.
It also cited fluctuations of oil prices and exchange rates among possible risks to the economy.
Government spending to care for the more than 1 million migrants who arrived in the country last year has contributed to a rise in private consumption, which is also fueled by low interest rates and a robust labor market.
But the economic consequences of an as yet unquantifiable influx of asylum seekers remained ""highly uncertain,"" the ministry said.
Germany's leading economic institutes said last week they expected the economy to have grown 0.6 percent in the first quarter.
Citing waning demand from abroad for German goods and services due to the global slowdown, they cut their 2016 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent.
The government on Wednesday stuck to its forecast of 1.7 percent.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2016 01:11PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales rebound signals strong spring selling season,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rebounded more than expected in March as supply improved, suggesting the housing market recovery remained intact despite signs that economic growth probably stalled in the first quarter.
The sales surge at the start of the spring selling season was a sign of confidence in the economy, and the momentum is expected to be sustained given low mortgage rates, recent stock market gains and a firming labor market, analysts said. 
""There cannot be too much wrong with the economy if consumers keep buying new homes. It shows confidence,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales surged 5.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.33 million units last month, beating economists' expectations for a 3.5 percent increase. Sales were up 1.5 percent from a year ago.
Existing home sales rose in all four regions in March, jumping by 11.1 percent in the Northeast and 9.8 percent in the Midwest. Single-family home sales vaulted 5.5 percent, while purchases of condominiums rose 1.8 percent.
Sales were concentrated in the middle part of the market, with lack of inventory constraining transactions in the low-end segment.
""It points to a very strong start to the crucial spring selling season, and initial anecdotal indications point to this positive momentum being sustained in coming months,"" said Millan Mulraine, chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications last week rose to their highest level in nine weeks as interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hovered at their lowest point in more than a year.
BRIGHT SPOT
Despite a report on Tuesday showing a plunge in housing starts and building permits in March, housing remains a bright spot amid indications that economic growth slowed to a crawl in the first three months of the year.
The economy has been hobbled by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undermined exports. Lower oil prices are also a drag, as they have eroded the profits of energy firms and prompted them to slash spending on capital projects.
First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are currently as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
In the wake of the housing data, the PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 0.23 percent, in line with a firmer U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), gained 0.47 percent and shares of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) rose 0.59 percent. The dollar (DXY) was up against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell.
Housing is being supported by a buoyant labor market, which has resulted in an acceleration in household formation. Sales, however, remain constrained by a dearth of homes available for sale, which is limiting choices for buyers.
While the number of unsold homes on the market in March rose 5.9 percent from February to 1.98 million units, supply was down 1.5 percent from a year ago. 
With inventories tight, houses are selling fast. In March, houses typically stayed on the market for 47 days, the fewest number since August, and down from 59 days in February.
""The quickening speed of inventory movement is a reflection of demand growing faster than supply,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com in Washington. ""The majority of buyers ... are looking to buy within the next six months, but the biggest challenge is the tight supply.""
At March's sales pace, it would take 4.5 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.4 months in February. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median house price increased 5.7 percent from a year ago to $222,700 last month. The rise in house prices is outstripping wage gains. While that could make it more difficult for first-time buyers to purchase a home, it also is boosting equity for homeowners, which could encourage them to put their homes on the market.

The share of first-time buyers was 30 percent last month, unchanged from both February and a year ago.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanâs exports fell for a sixth straight month in March as slowing growth in China, soft demand for electronic components for products such as the iPhone and a strengthening yen threatened to hold back the countryâs economic recovery.
Japanese electronics makers are unlikely to get much solace when Apple Inc (O:AAPL) reports its March quarter earnings next week. Analysts expect Apple to post its biggest-ever quarterly decline in iPhone shipments and present a weak sales forecast for the current quarter.
""A delayed recovery in the U.S. economy, slowdown in China, and sluggish demand for electronics parts on a cut in iPhone production were factors behind weak exports,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
The trade news came hard on the heels of a Reuters poll suggesting that although confidence at Japanese manufacturers rose in April it was expected to worsen again in the coming three months, reflecting worries over the strong yen and tepid overseas demand.
Weak indicators should add pressure on the government and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to do more to stimulate growth, while a series of earthquakes that struck a southern manufacturing hub in the past week could hamper supply chain and economic activity ahead.
Analysts say the quakes could cause a sharp drop in the country's factory output of cars and other goods in April - an unwelcome development for a flagging economy - although the impact may be short-lived if the supply chain is repaired quickly.
The Ministry of Finance said exports fell 6.8 percent in the year to March, versus a 6.9 percent drop expected by economists, and followed a 4.0 percent fall in February.
Exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell 7.1 percent in March, while the U.S.-bound shipments also dropped 5.1 percent year-on-year.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's shipments, fell 9.7 percent.
But exports to the European Union grew 12.1 pct in March, the biggest year-on-year gain since Feb 2011, driven by exports of ships to Italy and Greece, which grew fivefold from a year earlier, although that development is seen by the Ministry of Finance as a temporary blip.
In the Reuters Tankan taken April 1-15, exporters of cars and electronics complained about the rapid yen rise, which could dim Japan's recovery prospects and delay its recovery from two decades of deflation and stagnation.

The dollar so far this year is down about 10 percent <JPY=> on expectations that the United States would go slow in raising interest rates, prompting verbal warnings from Japanese policymakers against investors pushing up the yen too fast.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose in April but it is expected to worsen again in the coming three months, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday, reflecting concerns about the yen's rise and tepid overseas demand.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, found the service sector's mood soured in April and saw it getting worse because of the weakness in private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy.
In the poll of 510 big and mid-sized companies between April 1-15, exporters of cars and electronics complained about a rapid rise in the yen, which respondents believed could hamper Japan's recovery prospects and its effort to overcome two decades of deflation and stagnation.
A total 253 firms responded to the monthly poll.
""The yen's rise of nearly 10 yen since February and uncertainty over China's economy"" hurt business conditions, a manager at a machinery producer said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
The dollar so far this year is down about 10 percent, on track for its worst performance since 2010, prompting verbal warnings from Japanese policymakers against investors pushing up the yen too rapidly.
The dollar was hovering around 109 yen, after hitting a 17-month low of 107.63 yen last week on expectations that the United States would go slow in raising interest rates.
""On top of effects from the yen's gain, economic conditions in Asia and Japan are bad,"" said a manager at an electric machinery maker. A chemicals company respondent said: ""We're very concerned about the future although our business results have not worsened much despite the current yen strength and tame share prices.""
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 10 in April from 6 in March, led by materials industries such as oil refineries and steelmakers. It is seen sliding back to 6 in July.
The service-sector index fell to 23 from 24 in March and is seen declining to 15 in July, weighed on by retailers, information/communications and transport/utilities.
The last BOJ tankan on April 1 found that confidence among Japan's big manufacturers had hit the lowest in nearly three years and was seen worsening in the coming quarter, piling pressure on the government and the central bank to roll out fresh stimulus.
Economists slashed their growth estimate at the start of this year, with lingering concerns that the economy may have suffered a second straight quarter of contraction - the definition of a technical recession.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in March and permits for future home construction hit a one-year low, suggesting some cooling in the housing market in line with signs of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter.
Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department continued the recent run of weak data that has cast a pall on the economy's prospects. Economists say the fragile economy, combined with tepid inflation vindicated the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to raising interest rates.
""It's not just American consumers stepping back a bit this year, homebuilders also lost steam,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""This means the two key drivers of the expansion have lost their pep, which explains why the Fed will probably lift rates, at most, a couple of times in 2016."" 
Groundbreaking decreased 8.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.09 million units, the lowest level since October, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts slipping to a 1.17 million-unit pace last month.
Last month's drop in starts pointed to a moderation in housing market activity and mirrors other reports on business spending, industrial production, trade, inventory investment and retail sales that have suggested economic growth stalled in the first quarter.
The economy has been slammed by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have weighed on exports. Lower oil prices are also a drag as they have undercut profits of energy firms, prompting them to sharply curtail spending on capital projects.
First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are currently as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was down slightly, underperforming a broadly higher stock market that was buoyed by rising oil prices. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) were down 0.95 percent andLennar Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.84 percent.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government debt were weak.
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS
The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on April 26-27. Market-based measures of expectations for Fed policy have priced out an interest rate hike in the first half of the year, according to CME Group's FedWatch. 
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year.
Despite the slump in groundbreaking activity last month, housing market fundamentals remain strong against the backdrop of a buoyant labor market, which is increasing employment opportunities for young adults, and in turn boosting household formation.
Single-family starts, the largest segment of the market, tumbled 9.2 percent to a 764,000-unit pace in March, the lowest since October, after touching a more than eight-year high in February. They fell in all four regions last month, sliding 4.9 percent in the South, where most home building takes place. 
Groundbreaking on multi-family housing projects declined 7.9 percent to a 325,000-unit pace. Starts for buildings with five units and more fell to their lowest level in a year.
""There is still a lot of supply being built, but industry reports finding rental vacancy rates coming off the lows and rent gains slowing appear to be leading builders to pull back,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. Â 
Building permits dropped 7.7 percent to a 1.09 million-unit
rate last month, the lowest level since March last year. 

Permits for the construction of single-family homes decreased 1.2 percent in March after scaling a more than eight-year high in February. Multi-family building permits plunged 18.6 percent, with approvals for buildings with five units or more falling to their lowest level since August 2013.

BERLIN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - The mood among German analysts and investors rose for the second consecutive month in April, a survey by think tank ZEW showed on Tuesday, as positive signs from China helped allay concerns that weakness there would hurt the export-reliant German economy.
Mannheim-based ZEW said its monthly economic sentiment index rose to 11.2 points in April from 4.3 the previous month, beating a Reuters consensus forecast of 8.0.
""Surprisingly positive economic news from China may have brightened the mood among financial market experts,"" said ZEW economist Sascha Steffen, adding, however, that weaker growth in China and other emerging markets remained a drag on German exports.
China said earlier this month that its economy was showing positive signs despite persistent downward pressures.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, its weakest since the financial crisis in 2007-2008.
""If one of the biggest (economies) wobbles then the ripples are felt most strongly,"" Reinhold Festge, head of the German engineering association VDMA, told Reuters in an interview.
""We can get by if China has only 6-7 percent growth,"" he added.
Steffen added: ""In addition, concern about Great Britain's possible exit from the EU seems to be having a negative effect.""
A separate gauge of current conditions fell to 47.7 points from 50.7 in March.
STABILIZED MOOD
""The mood among companies has at least stabilized,"" said HSBC Trinkhaus economist Thomas Amend, adding this indicated that the economic low point may already have been reached.
""The international environment is stabilizing although the global economy is not showing any great momentum.""
Germany's leading economic institutes last week lowered their economic growth forecast for this year to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent, citing waning demand from abroad for German goods and services.
As the global economy loses momentum, Germany's traditional role as an export powerhouse has declined, with domestic demand taking over as the main growth driver.
The institutes said this trend would continue, predicting a further growth slowdown to 1.5 percent in 2017. The government is expected to update its economic forecasts for this year on April 20.
The German economy grew by 1.7 percent in 2015, the strongest rate in four years. The expansion was driven by robust private consumption and higher state spending, while record-high employment increased tax receipts and ultra-loose monetary policy sent Berlin's borrowing costs to all-time lows.

Expectations for the euro zone also improved, with that index rising to 21.5 points from 10.6 in the previous month. The ZEW index was based on a survey of 225 analysts and investors conducted April 4-18.

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion of the Australian economy by noting that GDP had grown by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter. Growth in household consumption and dwelling investment had been strong in the quarter, while net exports had been little changed and business investment had subtracted from growth. Including upward revisions for the September quarter meant that GDP had grown by 3.0 per cent over 2015, which was stronger than forecast in February. Members noted that this outcome was broadly consistent with the improvement in the labour market observed over 2015. More recent data had suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow at a moderate pace in early 2016 and that activity had continued to rebalance towards the non-mining sectors of the economy.
Members noted that growth in household consumption had picked up in the second half of 2015, supported by low interest rates and strong employment growth and despite further subdued growth in household income. The household saving ratio had been on a gradual downward trend over the previous few years. While retail sales growth had recorded little change in February, liaison had reported that trading conditions remained generally favourable and surveys of households' perceptions of their own finances remained above average.
Dwelling investment, particularly in the high-density sector, had risen strongly in the December quarter. Although residential dwelling approvals had declined over the past year or so, a sizeable pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support dwelling investment in the period ahead. Conditions in the established housing market had moderated over the past six months, with aggregate measures of year-ended housing price growth continuing to ease. Members noted that the easing in growth in apartment prices was consistent with the recent strong increase in supply and that there continued to be significant differences in demand conditions across the country; conditions had been relatively strong in the detached housing markets of Sydney and Melbourne and relatively weak in Perth. Housing credit growth had moderated a little over recent months to be close to 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, after rising through to mid 2015.
The decline in business investment in the December quarter had been broadly in line with expectations. Mining investment had fallen to around 4 per cent of nominal GDP from a peak of 8 per cent in 2012. Members noted that the recent rebound in commodity prices, even if sustained, was unlikely to lead to any material change in mining investment over the next couple of years. The December quarter national accounts also indicated that non-mining business investment had been little changed for several years. Nevertheless, surveys of business conditions had remained above average in recent months, consistent with the slight increase in non-mining profits (as a share of GDP) recorded in the national accounts, and business credit had continued to show strength, growing at over 8 per cent in six-month annualised terms in March. Members noted that employment growth in non-mining sectors of the economy had been relatively strong and that there was evidence that non-mining business investment had increased over the previous financial year in New South Wales and Victoria. Non-mining investment had fallen sharply in Western Australia, which suggested that the decline in commodity prices and mining investment had been adversely affecting non-mining business conditions and investment in that state.
Both export and import volumes had increased modestly in the December quarter. Over the year, resource exports had been increasing as projects were completed and production capacity increased. Much of this growth had been driven by liquefied natural gas projects and members noted that this was likely to remain the case over the next couple of years. Growth in net service exports, which was consistent with the pronounced increase in short-term visitor arrivals, had contributed around Â½ percentage point to growth over 2015. Members observed that this component of GDP was one of the most sensitive to changes in the exchange rate and discussed the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy more broadly.
Following stronger-than-expected outcomes in the latter part of 2015, the level of employment had been little changed over the three months to February. In the month of February, the participation rate had declined a little and the unemployment rate had fallen back to 5.8 per cent. Members observed that month-to-month volatility in the labour force data was not unusual and that, overall, the labour market was noticeably stronger than a year earlier: employment growth had remained a little above average, the unemployment rate had been on a downward trend since around mid 2015 and the participation rate had been on an upward trend. Leading indicators of employment growth had been mixed of late; job advertisements had levelled out in recent months after a period of relatively consistent increases, while job vacancies reported by businesses had continued to increase.
Labour cost pressures had remained subdued across a range of measures. The most recent data on enterprise agreements and the national accounts measure of average earnings per hour had confirmed the low growth of wages that was already apparent in the wage price index. Nominal unit labour costs had been unchanged for over four years, as growth in employee earnings had broadly matched growth in labour productivity. Members noted that subdued labour cost growth had led to low household income growth, but had also enabled businesses to increase employment by more than might have been the case otherwise.
International Economic Conditions
Indicators of global economic activity had eased a little over recent months, but were still consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining at a slightly below-average pace in the March quarter. Survey indicators had suggested that activity in the service sectors in a range of economies had moderated since late 2015 and that conditions in the manufacturing sector globally had remained subdued in early 2016. Global industrial production and trade volumes had been little changed over the past year. Members observed that these measures had been particularly weak for the Asian region. Meanwhile, growth in several advanced economies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over that period.
In China, the pace of overall growth in the first two months of the year appeared to have been broadly unchanged from the end of 2015, although the data were affected by the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday period. While growth in industrial production had been relatively stable, there had been a large decline in the production of crude steel and steel products. Nonetheless, imports of iron ore (including from Australia) had remained at a high level, consistent with the lower level of Chinese iron ore production following declines over 2015. The GDP growth target for 2016 had been lowered at the recent meeting of the National People's Congress to 6.5â7 per cent from âaround 7 per centâ in 2015. There had been acknowledgement that achieving this target would require some additional support from fiscal and financial policy. Members noted that the pick-up in growth in total social financing in China since the first half of 2015 was consistent with the authorities' willingness to support growth in economic activity.
Expectations of more policy stimulus in China in the near term appeared to have contributed to increases in iron ore and steel prices, both of which have risen substantially from their lows around the turn of the year. Members noted that this would imply a modest near-term rise in Australia's terms of trade, should current levels of commodity prices be sustained. However, at the same time, Chinese steel production had declined further and the global supply of iron ore was expected to increase as new mines ramped up production during 2016.
Although inflation in most advanced economies had increased since reaching a low point in 2015, inflation rates had remained below central bank targets. In Japan, despite relatively tight labour market conditions, wage growth was expected to decline a little in the year ahead based on the outcome of recent wage negotiations between unions and large employers. Ongoing weakness in output growth and lower oil prices had led the Bank of Japan to revise down its forecast for headline inflation in 2016 and push out the point at which inflation is expected to reach the target. Although the euro area economy appeared to have experienced further modest growth in the March quarter and the labour market had continued to improve, inflation remained little changed over recent months at rates below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target. ECB staff had downgraded their forecasts for GDP growth and inflation, noting weakening global growth (particularly among emerging market economies) and the appreciation of the euro, and did not expect inflation to return to the target until after 2018.In contrast, measures of year-ended headline and core inflation in the United States had picked up in recent months.
GDP growth in the United States had continued to be driven by consumption, supported by strong employment growth, lower fuel prices and increasing household wealth. Notwithstanding these developments, the US Federal Reserve left its forecasts for inflation and GDP little changed, citing concerns about global economic and financial market developments over recent months.
Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by observing that sentiment in global markets had improved over the past month. This had been reflected in a rise in equity prices and a narrowing of spreads between yields on riskier debt and US sovereign debt.
In terms of monetary policy, the ECB had eased policy further at its March meeting. In addition to making small reductions in its policy rates, the size of the ECB's monthly asset purchases had been increased and eligibility had been widened to include investment-grade corporate bonds. Targeted long-term refinancing operations had also been re-introduced and refined: banks would be able to borrow from the ECB for four years at an interest rate around zero at the time of the loan being extended, which would become negative if certain benchmarks for lending to the private sector were met. Members noted that these operations were expected to result in a significant increase in the size of the ECB's balance sheet over the next year or so, depending on the take-up of the operations by banks.
The US Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at its March meeting and revised down the projected path of policy tightening in 2016. Market-implied expectations were for an even slower pace of tightening, with the next policy rate increase not expected until early 2017.
The US dollar depreciated on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, particularly following the downward revision of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy rate expectations. Members noted that the US dollar was now lower than at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate last December.
In trade-weighted terms, the renminbi had depreciated a little further over the past month to be 6 per cent below its peak in August 2015. Capital outflows from China had been smaller in February than in recent months, reflecting, in part, a tightening of some capital controls and reduced expectations of exchange rate depreciation. Consistent with the smaller capital outflows, Chinese foreign currency reserves declined by a smaller amount than in recent months. Most other Asian and emerging market currencies had appreciated markedly against the US dollar over the past month.
The Australian dollar had appreciated by almost 7 per cent against the US dollar over the past month. It had appreciated by 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting stronger domestic economic data, the rise in commodity prices and the fact that the renminbi (which has the highest weight in the trade-weighted basket) had depreciated by only slightly less against the Australian dollar than had the US dollar. At the time of the meeting, the Australian dollar was around its highest level since mid 2015.
Yields on US and German sovereign bonds were little changed over the past month, while yields on Japanese government bonds fell further, with almost two-thirds of these now trading at yields below zero. Australian government bond yields moved broadly in line with yields on US sovereign bonds. Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt and corporate bonds narrowed, particularly for commodity-producing countries and corporations.
Global share prices rose significantly over the past month. The share prices of US banks had retraced around half of their sharp falls earlier in the year. European bank share prices rose following the ECB's policy announcement, as some of the measures were assessed as beneficial to bank profitability. Australian equity prices rose by less than the increases observed in other developed markets, in part because there was a smaller rebound in bank share prices given concerns about loan provisioning.
Domestically, bond issuance by Australian banks had been very solid over the past year, with the March quarter the strongest in six years. Members noted that modest rises in some small business lending rates had been announced by the major banks since the previous meeting. Lending rates to this category of borrowers remained very low. Lending rates for large businesses had been little changed.
Members noted that no change in the cash rate was expected at the current meeting.
Financial Stability
Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.
While markets had experienced further bouts of volatility, notably in the early part of the year, underlying risk factors had tended to evolve more gradually. In China, the slowing pace of economic growth, the large run-up in debt and deteriorating loan quality had prompted concerns over downside risks to its financial system. Similar concerns applied to some other emerging market economies, especially those most exposed to the large declines in global commodity prices and where corporate sector leverage had increased the most. Risks also remained elevated in some advanced economies, particularly Japan and Europe, where prospects for the banking sectors had been marked down from already weak starting points. However, these external developments had not significantly affected Australia's financial system. Members observed that Australian banks' direct exposures to China and other emerging markets were small. They also discussed the larger exposures of Australian banks to the housing and dairy sectors in New Zealand.
Domestic financial risks had shifted over the past six months from housing lending towards residential development and some other commercial property markets. Members noted that the actions of regulators since late 2014 had helped induce a tightening of banks' housing lending standards. In particular, the share of high loan-to-valuation lending had taken a noticeable step down and tighter serviceability metrics had reduced maximum loan sizes. Housing market conditions had also moderated. These developments had generally enhanced resilience in the household sector, but could cause issues for developers of some apartment projects if demand for their product were to slow significantly.
Some other commercial property markets had also been adjusting with a lag to a slowing in demand. Office vacancy rates in the resource-intensive states remained very high as further new supply continued to come on line. Commercial property yields more broadly were being compressed across a range of market segments. In the rest of the business sector, the balance sheets of some resource-related companies had come under strain following the large falls in global commodity prices over recent years. In contrast, the non-resources business sector generally showed little sign of financial difficulties.
Members observed that Australian-based banks had also taken steps to increase their resilience to domestic risks. As well as changing their housing lending standards, they had tightened the availability of finance to some parts of the property sector and increased capital levels substantially. Profitability had remained high. Banks' non-performing loans remained low overall; while they had picked up for resources-related lending, banks' exposures to this sector and mining services firms were small, although some foreign banks operating in Australia had much higher exposure shares. Members nonetheless observed that as banks competed for lending in a narrower range of markets, it would be important that serviceability and other lending standards remained appropriate.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that there had been some easing in the growth of global economic activity, particularly in emerging markets, although growth in several advanced economies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over the past year. In aggregate, the outlook was for growth in Australia's major trading partners to remain a little below average, as previously forecast. Globally, inflation had remained low and very easy monetary policies were continuing to provide support to global demand.
Oil and iron ore prices had risen noticeably since earlier in the year. The rise in commodity prices had been accompanied by an appreciation of the Australian dollar, which also partly reflected the expectation that US monetary policy would be more accommodative over the coming year than had been anticipated earlier. Members noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate progress in activity rebalancing towards the non-mining sectors of the economy.
Domestically, the latest national accounts data suggested that the economy grew at a moderate pace in the December quarter and more recent data were consistent with this having continued in early 2016. Over 2015, GDP growth was higher than earlier forecast, which went some way towards reconciling the strength in a range of labour market indicators over that period. Although employment had been little changed over recent months, some slowing was to be expected following the strong gains recorded in the December quarter and the unemployment rate was lower than it was around the middle of 2015. On all measures, wage growth remained at quite low levels and domestic cost pressures, more generally, remained subdued. Combined with the appreciation of the exchange rate and the low level of inflation globally, this suggested that inflation in Australia was likely to remain low over the next year or two.
Given these conditions, members assessed that it was appropriate for monetary policy to be very accommodative. Low interest rates had played an important role in promoting the gradual increase in consumption growth and activity in the housing market. Conditions in the established housing market appeared to have moderated over the past year, in part reflecting the effect of supervisory measures designed to emphasise prudent lending standards and contain risks in the housing market. Housing credit growth had moderated a little over recent months and there had been a change in the composition of lending between investors and owner-occupiers.
Members judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore decided that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate. New information would allow the Board to reassess the outlook for inflation and decide whether the improvement in labour market conditions evident last year was continuing. Continued low inflation would provide scope to ease monetary policy further, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent."

985,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2016 04:03AM ET</span>","China's first-quarter GDP grows 1.1 percent, slowest quarterly pace since 2010","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy expanded a seasonally-adjusted 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016 from the fourth quarter of last year, National Bureau of Statistics data showed, the lowest quarterly expansion on record since 2010. 
The slower-than-expected quarterly growth rate comes amid other signs the Chinese economy is stabilizing in the first quarter, including positive surprises from trade, inflation, output and credit.
Analysts had expected quarterly growth of 1.5 percent for the first quarter, but the statistics bureau did not release quarterly figures when it issued annual figures on Friday.
""The 1.1 percent growth rate clearly illustrates that China's economy still faces downward pressures,"" Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), wrote in a research note on Monday.
""If we calculate the seasonally adjusted GDP growth based on the qoq numbers, we find that there is a big gap (0.4 percent point) between headline GDP growth (non-seasonally adjusted) and the seasonally adjusted GDP growth. As economists, we always prefer the seasonally adjusted qoq numbers, which better tell the underlying growth momentum,"" he added. 
China's economy grew 6.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter in 2016, and 6.9 percent for the whole of 2015. That is the slowest rate since 2009, but the pace applies to a much larger economy - around $10 trillion in 2015. 
Over the weekend, the statistics bureau also revised 2015 quarterly growth figures for three quarters. 
In the first quarter of 2015, quarterly growth was revised upwards to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent. In the second quarter, it was revised downwards to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent, while in the fourth quarter, quarterly growth was revised downwards to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent. 
The 2015 third quarter quarterly economic growth figure remained unchanged. 
The statistics bureau also revised quarterly growth figures for 2014 in two quarters. For the first quarter, the quarterly figure was revised upwards to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent, and in the third quarter, the figure was revised upwards to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent. 
The 2014 quarterly economic data for the second and fourth quarters remained unchanged. 

Some China watchers, nevertheless, suspect that real growth levels could be much lower than what the official data suggest.

The southern city of Shenzhen continued to be the top performer, with home prices surging 61.6 percent from a year ago, followed by Shanghai with a 25 percent gain.
Prices in the two cities were up 3.7 percent and 3.6 percent respectively from a month earlier.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 4.9 percent last month from a year ago, picking up from February's 3.6 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) on Monday.
March prices were up 1.1 percent compared to a month ago.
China's housing market bottomed out in the second half of 2015 on a series of government support measures, but a strong rebound in prices in the biggest cities has sparked concerns that some markets may be overheating, driving Shanghai and Shenzhen's authorities to tighten downpayment requirements for second homes and raising the eligibility bar for non-residents.
While home sales in the two cities plunged as much as 52 percent after the tightening, prices eased only by single digit, according to data from China Real Estate Index System (CREIS).
April's official data, which will reflect the impact of the tightening measures, is due to be released in mid-May.
Area of property sold in the first quarter grew 33.1 percent to a near three-year high, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday.
While property in China's top-tier cities is booming, prices in smaller centers, where most of China's urban population lives, are still sinking and complicating government efforts to spread wealth more evenly and arrest slowing economic growth.
""(Monthly) price rises among cities still showed big differences. Cities with big rises were concentrated in the first-tier and, in part, the hot tier-two cities. Their growth is much faster than other cities, with the rest of the second-tier and third-tier cities relatively stable,"" Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the NBS, said in a statement accompanying the data.

The NBS data showed 40 of 70 major cities tracked by the NBS saw year-on-year price gains, up from 32 in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production fell more than expected in March as manufacturing output dropped by the most in a year and mining maintained its downward trend, the latest indication that economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter.
A rebound in growth is, however, anticipated despite other data on Friday showing a further erosion in consumer sentiment in early April.
Economists say a confluence of temporary factors, including an ongoing problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations, has contributed to lowering growth in the first quarter. The government last year took steps to refine the seasonal adjustment for some components of GDP, which economists said left residual seasonality in the data.
""The first quarter was clearly a dud, but there are reasons to be optimistic. There are still measurement issues, with the residual seasonality in GDP, and history shows that reverses in the second quarter,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moodyâs Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
Industrial output declined 0.6 percent last month after dropping 0.6 percent drop in February, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Industrial production has fallen in six of the last seven months. Economists had forecast industrial output falling only 0.1 percent last month. Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2 percentin the first quarter after decreasing at a 3.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Industrial capacity use in March fell to its lowest level since August 2010.
The report joined data on retail sales, business spending, trade and wholesale inventories in suggesting that economic growth slowed to crawl at the turn of the year.
Growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 89.7 early this month from a reading of 91.0 in March amid concerns that slowing economic growth would hamper job creation.
Sentiment has declined for four straight months. Households' long-term inflation expectations fell back to their all-time low, which could buy a cautious Federal Reserve more time to keep interest rates at current low levels.
""Persistently low price expectations increase the risks of monetary policy remaining highly accommodative for longer than currently expected,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were little changed.
WORST LIKELY OVER
The industrial sector has been undermined by a slowingglobal economy and robust dollar, which have eroded demandfor U.S. manufactured goods.
It is also being weighed down by lower oil prices that have undercut capital investment in the energy sector, as well efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang. But there are signs the worst of the industrial sector downturn is over, with recent manufacturing surveys turning higher.
A third report on Friday from the New York Federal Reserve showed factory activity in New York state accelerated in April to its highest level in more than a year as new orders and shipments increased.
""It is likely the inventory correction and stronger dollar continued to weigh on the output data for the first quarter, and we remain hopeful that the worst of the drags from these factors have passed and that activity will pick up shortly,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Last month, manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent, the biggest decline since February 2015, after slipping 0.1 percent in February. Manufacturing was dragged down by motor vehicle and parts production, which plunged 1.6 percent after rising 0.8 percent the prior month.
For the first quarter, manufacturing output rose at a 0.6 percent rate.
Mining production tumbled 2.9 percent as oil and gas well drilling plummeted 8.5 percent after diving 15.8 percent in February. Last month's drop in mining output was the largest since September 2008, when output was curtailed because of hurricanes. Mining production has declined in each of the last seven months.

A plunge in oil prices since June 2014 has hurt the profits of oil-field companies like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), leading to deep cuts in their capital spending budgets. Unseasonably warm weather in March hurt utilities output, which fell 1.2 percent after declining 3.6 percent in February. Weak utilities production suggests weak demand for heating, which likely hurt consumer spending.

Area of property sold in the first quarter grew 33.1 percent, compared to 28.2 percent in the first two months of 2016, the highest since May 2013, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday.
The growth in real estate investment, a major driver of the economy which affects more than 40 other sectors from cement to furniture, was up from an increase of 3 percent in the January to February period. 
""In our view the uptick in construction is premature and we are skeptical whether it can be sustained. While inventories of unsold housing have eased somewhat they are still too high and need to come down more,"" said Louis Kuijs, economist at Oxford Economics based in Hong Kong. 
But in the smaller cities, with less well-disciplined developers and weaker demand, inventories of unsold housing have not fallen enough. 
China's largest commercial developer Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties (HK:3699) said last month it would scale back investment and construction in third and fourth-tier cities because of oversupply.
Adding to the inventory problem in the lower-tier cities, sales in two major big cities were also seen plunging in the last two weeks after authorities made it tougher to buy homes in the bigger cities to prevent a property bubble, weighing on the national property sales pick-up.
The total floor area sold in Shenzhen fell a weekly 28 percent in the week beginning March 28, the first day after the new rules took effect on March 25. The floor area sold fell another 25 percent in the following week, data from China Real Estate Index System (CREIS) showed.
Shanghai sales fell 52 percent and 7.5 percent respectively in the same two consecutive weeks. 
April's official data, which reflects the impact of the tightening measures, will be released in mid-May. 
Last month new property development starts were up 19.2 percent despite efforts by developers to sell off bloated inventories of unsold homes, and inventory floor area was 13.1 percent higher than a year earlier.

""The current housing construction pick-up supported overall GDP growth in Q1 and should do so in Q2. However, we think it is likely that the property construction cycle will ease again and that the government will need to continue to rely on other drivers, including infrastructure investment, to meet its ambitious growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016,"" said Kuijs.

In recent years markets have contended with a series of revolutions in borrowing, market structure and federal regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis. 
These developments have fueled concerns that liquidity is drying up across fixed-income markets, Powell said in testimony before a United States Senate panel adding ""although many recent studies have found it difficult to identify such a broad reduction."" 
""It may be that liquidity has deteriorated only in certain market segments,"" he said in remarks before the economic policy subcommittee of the Senate's banking committee.
""It may also be that, even if liquidity is adequate in normal conditions, it has become more fragile, or prone to disappearing under stress,"" he said.
Powell cautioned mutual funds and other investors in the corporate bond market about recent record levels of borrowing. With dealer balance sheets shrinking, he said, buyers now bear greater liquidity risk. 
There are signs that liquidity is improving in corporate debt, such as declines in estimated bid-ask spreads, but ""there is some evidence that liquidity has deteriorated for the lowest-rated bonds,"" he also said. 
In the Treasuries market, changes in technology have allowed trading to move ""at extreme speed,"" and may have ""led to greater liquidity risk, or sudden declines in liquidity."" At the same time, changes in the market structure have led to smaller average trades, making it hard to see ""the effect of trading on prices"" and measure liquidity.
The post-crisis regulations have affected liquidity, leading both to increases and decreases, Powell said.

""Some reduction in market liquidity is a cost worth paying in helping to make the overall financial system significantly safer,"" he said.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2016 11:51AM ET</span>",Tame U.S. inflation supports Fed's cautious rate policy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices barely rose in March and underlying inflation slowed, suggesting little urgency for a cautious Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near term.
The benign inflation backdrop is prevailing despite tightening labor market conditions, underscored by other data on Thursday showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits back at a 42-1/2-year low last week.
""A rate hike is unquestionably off the table for April, with a June rate increase increasingly unlikely barring a surge in domestic activity and perceived calm on the international front,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index gained 0.1 percent last month as a rebound in gasoline prices was partially offset by a drop in the cost of food. 
Medical care and housing costs also retreated in March after strong increases in the prior two months. 
The CPI fell 0.2 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, the CPI increased 0.9 percent after advancing 1.0 percent in February.
Economists had forecast the CPI gaining 0.2 percent last month and rising 1.1 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, inched up 0.1 percent after two strong monthly readings. March's increase in the core CPI was the smallest since August and followed a 0.3 percent rise in February. 
In the 12 months through March, the core CPI rose 2.2 percent after gaining 2.3 percent in February. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is running below the core CPI. Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently expressed doubts about the sustainability of broad gains in prices and said she believed that ""transitory"" factors were behind the run-up in prices.
The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on April 26-27. Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations have priced out a rate hike at this month's meeting and have almost eliminated the chances of a move in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch. It currently gives a 41 percent probability of a rate increase in November and a 55 percent chance in December.
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year. 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. U.S. stocks were little changed.
TIGHT JOBS MARKET
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended April 9. That matched the level for early March, which was the lowest since November 1973. 
Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 58 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
Labor market strength comes despite recent reports on trade, wholesale inventories, retail sales and business spending suggesting economic growth almost halted in the first quarter after posting a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Growth estimates for the January-March quarter are as low as a 0.2 percent pace. 
""Low labor market separations and steady payroll gains should produce healthy household income growth over the next few months, indicating the likelihood of a rebound in consumption and overall GDP growth following the apparent softness in the first quarter,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.2 percent after plunging 13.0 percent in February. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, with the cost of food consumed at home posting its largest decline since April 2009.
The core CPI was restrained by housing and medical costs, as well as apparel. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increased 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in February. 
Medical care costs slowed their rapid ascent, gaining only 0.1 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in February. Apparel prices fell 1.1 percent in March, reversing the prior month's 1.6 percent advance. 
Despite the moderation in the core CPI last month, economists believe that a fading dollar rally, stabilizing oil prices and tightening labor market have laid the foundation for a pick-up in inflation this year.

""The fundamentals point to higher inflation in the near term,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended April 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That matched the level for early March, which was the lowest since November 1973.
Claims for the week ending April 2 were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 270,000 in the latest week. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 58 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
But with inflation tame and wages rising moderately as the firming labor market attracts both previously discouraged and new job seekers, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates again before the second half of the year.
The Fed increased its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and no states had been estimated.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,500 to 265,000 last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 18,000 to 2.17 million in the week ended April 2, the lowest level since mid-October.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 3,000 to 270,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 57 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended April 2 fell to 2.171 million from 2.189 million in the preceding week. The previous weekâs figured was revised down from 2.191 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to drop to 2.183 million.
The four-week moving average was 265,000, a decline of 1,500 from the previous week's revised figure of 266,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

1024,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2016 07:00AM ET</span>",Bank of England makes no changes to rates in unanimous decision,"Investing.com - Minutes from the Bank of Englandâs policy meeting showed that all nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5% and noted the difficulty involved in interpreting macroeconomic and financial market indicators over the next few months given the upcoming vote on Britain's membership in the European Union.
The BOE said it was holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.50%, in a widely expected move. The rate has been held at that level since March 2009.
The central bank also said it was to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at Â£375 billion.
All nine MPC members also unanimously agreed to make no changes to the central bank's Â£375 billion asset-purchase program.
According to the minutes, the MPC noted that the current shortfall in inflation (at 0.5% compared to the 2% target) is âdue predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to fade over the next yearâ and noted that core inflation also remain subdued.
The BoE further noted that there was mixed news on near-term prospects for global growth, but that domestic growth has been steady and it expected inflation to rise over the next year, thanks to the pickup in the price of oil and the recent depreciation seen in the pound.
The bank also said that it expected âmore likely than notâ to raise rates over the forecast period, but noted that the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming June 23 referendum on the U.K.âs membership in the European Union meant that âmacroeconomic and financial market indicators harder to interpret over the next few months, and the Committee is likely to react more cautiously to data news over this period than would normally be the caseâ.
""All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles,"" the minutes showed.
The MPC concluded that the aforementioned statement was based on expectations and should not be considered a ""promise"" as all future decisions would be data-dependent.
The pound had seen weakness in the lead up to the report based on media sources suggesting that two MPC members, Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe, could vote to cut interest rates. After the release, GBP/USD was trading at 1.4147 from around 1.4142 ahead of the announcement, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7957 from 0.7958 earlier.

But the IPA Bellwether survey published on Thursday showed that companies raised their marketing budgets marginally in the first quarter, with 23.3 percent of respondents forecasting a higher spend over the next 12 months.
During the first three months of the year when the 300 British marketing professionals were questioned, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron agreed a new deal with EU leaders and set June 23 as the date for a vote on European Union membership. 
The report's author said uncertainty about the referendum, plus concerns about a weaker rate of global growth, dented executives' views of prospects for their sectors.
The number of executives who were pessimistic in the first quarter compared to three months ago exceeded those who were optimistic by 6.5 percent, a reversal of the 7 percent lead held by the optimists in the previous period. 
The IPA Bellwether also forecast that advertising spending would grow 3.3 percent in 2016, a downgrade to a forecast of 3.9 percent growth made in the fourth quarter.
Paul Bainsfair, Director General of the IPA advertising, marketing and communications body, said the next quarterly survey would probably present a clearer picture.
""Following the referendum in June, the summer Bellwether should hopefully provide better clarity on where we are headed,"" he said in a statement.
""On balance, some growth seems the most likely outcome especially with the European football championships and Olympics set to provide a shot in the arm to budgets in the immediate months ahead.""
A separate report by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) published on Thursday said spending on digital advertising grew 16.4 percent in Britain in 2015, up 16.4 percent from 2014, representing the fastest growth rate for seven years. 
The IAB said smartphones were the driving force behind the pick-up in growth, with spending on mobile rising 60 percent to 2.63 billion pounds ($3.7 billion), accounting for 30.5 percent of all digital advertising.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in March as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and other items, further evidence that economic growth stumbled in the first quarter. 
Other data on Wednesday showed a surprise drop in producer prices last month as rising energy prices were offset by a decline in the cost of services. The two reports suggested the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates until later this year. 
""The data solidifies the well-entrenched narrative of a very weak first quarter for the U.S. economy. For the Federal Reserve ... it argues for continued caution,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales declined 0.3 percent last month, confounding economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain. They were unchanged in February.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services ticked up 0.1 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
March's weak numbers implied that consumer spending lost steam after robust gains in 2015, and put consumption on a slow path heading into the second quarter. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
""Consumer activity, which has been the primary driver of economic activity, in the wake of the sluggishness in the industrial sector, has lost momentum,"" said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York. ""The weak numbers for March will probably set a lower jumping-off point for personal spending in the second quarter.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on strong trade data from China. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks were trading higher. Prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries fell slightly.
TAME INFLATION
The retail sales report added to recent data on trade and business spending in suggesting the economy hit a soft patch in the first three months of the year. That was reinforced by a second report from the Commerce Department showing a dip in business inventories in February.
GDP growth estimates for the first quarter are currently as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy expanded at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index slipped 0.1 percent last month after dropping 0.2 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, the PPI dipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in February.
Economists had forecast the PPI advancing 0.2 percent last month and gaining 0.3 percent from a year ago. 
Soft producer prices point to overall inflation remaining below the Fed's 2 percent target for a while. Tame inflation is a key factor in the U.S. central bank's policy of gradually raising interest rates even as the labor market tightens. 
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers signaled last month that there would be two more rate hikes this year.
The Fed's policy-setting committee will meet next on April 26-27. Market-based measures of Fed policy expectations have priced out a rate hike at that meeting and have almost eliminated the chances of a move in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch. It currently gives a 44 percent probability of a rate increase in November and a 57 percent chance in December.
Retail sales remain soft despite a strengthening labor market, which is starting to boost wages. Part of the weakness could be due to a stock market sell-off that hurt consumer sentiment early this year. The value of sales is also being restrained by low prices, as retailers offer huge discounts to clear unwanted merchandise clogging up warehouses.
""Consumers have been spooked by the recent turmoil in the stock market and decided that it is probably better to put some money aside and slow down their spending,"" said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Auto sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, the largest decrease in just over a year. Households are buying fewer automobiles after record purchases last year.
Receipts at service stations recorded their biggest gain in nine months as gasoline prices turned higher. Sales at clothing stores and online retailers fell. 

Americans also spent less at restaurants and bars, but increased purchases of sporting goods as well as electronics and appliances. Sales of building materials and garden equipment jumped.

The Washington-based industry group's mortgage market index rose to 520.2 in the week ended April 8, up 10 percent from the prior week. The latest reading that was adjusted for seasonally factors was the strongest since the week of Feb. 21.
The weekly seasonally-adjusted gauge on mortgage requests to buy homes rose 8 percent to 241.9, which was the highest since October 2015 and the second highest since May 2010, MBA said.
The seasonally-adjusted barometer on applications to refinance increased 11.3 percent last week to 2,122.0, the highest in seven weeks.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, slipped 0.1 percent in February, which was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories in January were revised down to show a 0.1 percent drop instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.3 percent in February after increasing 0.2 percent in January. Auto inventories rose 1.3 percent in February after increasing 0.8 percent in January.
Inventories subtracted about two-tenths of a percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth.
Economic growth estimates for the first quarter are currently as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy expanded at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
Businesses accumulated record inventories in the first half of 2015, which outpaced demand. Despite their concerted efforts to reduce unsold goods through deep discounts, inventories still remain too high and pose a downside risk to GDP growth in the first half of 2016.
Business sales fell 0.4 percent in February after decreasing 0.8 percent in January. At February's sales pace, it would take 1.41 months for businesses to clear shelves. That matched February's inventory-to-sales ratio, which was the highest since May 2009.

The high ratio suggests businesses could continue working through the inventory overhang through the first half of the year, hurting manufacturing and curbing GDP growth.

The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, in line with market expectations.
Furthermore, the Canadian monetary authority lifted its forecast for GDP growth in 2016 to 1.7%, compared to an earlier estimate of 1.4%.
However, it did cut its forecast for growth in 2017 to 2.3% compared to the previous estimation of 2.4%.
The BoC noted that the combined effect of global and domestic developments would normally have resulted in a downgrade to the outlook, but explained that the fiscal measures announced in the March Canadian budget will have a ânotably positive impact on GDPâ.
""Overall, the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher, in part due to regional shifts in activity associated with the structural adjustment underway in Canadaâs economy,"" the BoC said in the release.
""The Bankâs Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 0.5%,"" it concluded.
BoC Governor Stephen Poloz was to comment on the decision at a press conference later in the day.

The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year.

Wholesale food prices fell 0.9 percent last month. Prices for services fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since October, after being unchanged in February.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that retail sales decreased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, surprising the forecast for a rise of 0.1%. Retail sales for February had dropped 0.1%.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in March, compared to forecasts for an advance of 0.4%. Core sales in February declined 0.1%.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports in March returned to growth for the first time in nine months, adding to further signs of stabilisation in the world's second-largest economy that cheered regional investors.
March exports rose a blistering 11.5 percent from a year earlier, the first increase since June and the largest percentage rise since February 2015.
Fears of a hard landing in China even as policymakers press on with tough reforms to rebalance the economy have rattled financial markets, with investors eagerly hunting for tentative signs the economic slump may be bottoming. 
Economists, however, warned that Wednesday's data was not evidence of stronger global demand as it was heavily skewed by base effects and seasonal distortions from the Lunar New Year. 
And despite signs of green shoots for China, first quarter GDP data on Friday is expected to show the economy growing at its slowest pace since the financial crisis. Combined with tepid inflation, that is likely to keep Chinese monetary policy loose for some time yet.
Investors celebrated, nevertheless, with key Chinese stock indexes hitting three-month highs and the yuan firming, while regional stock markets and the Australian dollar , which often trades as a proxy to Chinese growth, also firmed. 
""China's foreign trade sector will likely improve from last year due to low comparables, but the improvement will not be dramatic, as the trends in external markets are not great,"" said Wang Tie Shi, economist with Industrial Securities.
The upside surprise comes after other March economic indicators hinted of slight improvements in the broader economy, although other surveys have shown intensifying downward pressure on wages and employment. 
Imports continued to fall but less than expected, declining by 7.6 percent in dollar denominated terms and volumes of most major commodities, notably copper and iron ore, rose strongly.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $29.86 billion for the month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, versus a forecast of $30.85 billion. 
""I think we should focus on the better-than-expected imports growth rate, which means domestic demand is also recovering, driven by infrastructure investment and also the real estate sector recovery,"" said Ma Xiaoping, analyst at HSBC.
MOMENTOUS SHIFT
China's slowdown might not be quite as severe as first feared but its ""momentous"" shift from investment-led growth is still having a chilling effect on trade globally, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.
The IMF estimates every 1 percentage point investment-driven drop in China's GDP, cut growth for the entire Group of 20 nations by 0.25 percentage points.
""Even countries that have few direct trade linkages with China are being affected through the Chinese slowdown's impact on prices of commodities and manufactured goods, and on global confidence and risk sentiment,"" the Fund said.
Regardless, overseas investors also appeared inspired by the trade data. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added 1.7 percent and Japanese shares (N225) gained 2.8 percent. 
Tony Nash, managing partner at advisory firm Complete Intelligence, which focuses on global trade flows, sees China's exports and imports stabilising over the next six months. 
""As we close out Q2 and enter Q3, we'll see more stable trade data before starting to see sustainable, small rises in both sides,"" Nash said, adding data should be much less volatile in the second half as currencies and commodities stabilise.
NOT OUT OF WOODS YET
Economists polled by Reuters had expected March exports to rise 2.5 percent, after tumbling 25.4 percent in February - the worst showing since May 2009, and expected imports to fall 10.2 percent, based on weakness in global demand.
""Data across other Asian economies suggest that the headwinds in the trade sector remain,"" Zhou Hao, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, said in a research note. 
Still, markets were relieved to see a surge in China's demand for commodities, with copper arrivals hitting a record in March and pushing up first quarter imports by 30 percent from a year earlier. Exports to key markets such as the United States and Europe also posted double digit month-on-month gains. 
China's rising exports are also due in some part to a successful move up the value chain by mid-tier manufacturers. 
""China's export sector is not losing competitiveness. In fact, China is increasing its share of other countries' imports, even though the global volume of trade has been sadly stagnant in recent years,"" HSBC wrote in a research note.
Even as Chinese factories have learned to build more expensive car components and wind turbines, they have been shedding capacity in lower-end sectors like textiles and outsourcing such production to neighboring countries. 
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China's economic indicators showed signs of improvement in the first quarter but a sluggish world economy and volatile markets were undermining gains.

The government is aiming for economic growth of 6.5 to 7 percent this year, following 6.9 percent growth last year - the weakest pace in a quarter of a century.

The survey of 1,200 people by the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) showed its index of consumer sentiment dropped 4 percent in April, from March.
That left the index 1.1 percent down on April last year at 95.1, meaning pessimists outnumbered optimists.
The Liberal National government of Malcolm Turnbull releases the 2016/17 budget on May 3 and has promised to ""live within its means"" to tackle years of deficits.
The consumer gloom was a marked contrast to a survey of Australian businesses out on Tuesday that showed they were enjoying the best conditions in eight years, with sales, profits and employment all rising.
Analysts tend to put more store on surveys of actual business conditions rather than consumer sentiment which tend to swings around a lot and often say little about actual spending habits.
It was notable that the April survey actually showed respondents were more confident about buying major household items even while fretting about their finances.
The index of family finances compared to a year ago fell 3.9 percent in the month, while the outlook for the 12 months ahead dropped 6.6 percent.

Expectations for the economic outlook over the next 12 months sank 5.5 percent, while the outlook for the next five years slipped 6.0 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices rose in March for the first time in nine months as the cost of petroleum products increased, but the lingering effects of a strong dollar suggested inflation will continue to increase gradually.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday import prices gained 0.2 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.4 percent drop in February. It was the first time since June that import prices rose and the largest increase since May.
The increase, however, was less than economists' expectations for a 1.0 percent gain. Import prices were previously reported to have declined 0.3 percent in February. 
Prices of imported products were down 6.2 percent in the 12 months through March, the smallest gain since December 2014, suggesting import deflation was ebbing. 
Weak import prices have contributed to holding inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by data.
Benign inflation has been a key factor in the U.S. central bank's policy of gradually raising interest rates even as the labor market tightens. 
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade and policymakers recently forecast only two more rate hikes this year.
Inflation, both on the consumer and producer levels, has been dampened by cheap oil and a robust dollar. The greenback gained about 20 percent against the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015.
Oil prices, however, are showing signs of stabilizing. 
Last month, imported petroleum prices rose 6.5 percent, the first increase since June, after tumbling 6.2 percent in February. Import prices excluding petroleum slipped 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in February. 
Non-petroleum import prices have not increased since March 2014, underscoring the impact of the dollar's strength. But the dollar has depreciated 2.6 percent on a trade-weighted basis so far this year. 
Imported food prices fell 0.6 percent last month, while prices for industrial supplies and materials excluding petroleum were unchanged. 
Prices for imported capital goods dipped 0.1 percent and the cost of imported automobiles edged up 0.1 percent. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding autos fell 0.3 percent.
The report also showed export prices were unchanged in March after declining 0.5 percent in February. Export prices were down 6.1 percent from a year ago.

Export prices for industrial supplies and materials rose 0.7 percent. Prices for food exports fell 2.5 percent.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said on Tuesday its small business optimism index dipped 0.3 point to a reading of 92.6 last month, the lowest since February 2014.
It has declined from a reading of 100 in December 2014 and has pushed further off its 42-year average of 98.
""A 'chartist' looking at the data historically might conclude that the index has clearly hit a top and is flashing a recession signal. The April survey will decide whether or not the alarm should be rung,"" the NFIB said in statement.
The soft reading fits in with recent economic data on consumer and business spending as well as wholesale inventory investment that have suggested economic growth slowed sharply from the fourth quarter's 1.4 percent annualized rate.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first
quarter are currently well below a 1 percent rate.
Four components of the NFIB index rose last month, with the remaining six declining.
While small business owners were fairly upbeat about business conditions in the next six months and their attitudes toward capital spending improved a bit, they was some softening in their views of the labor market.
Still, labor market indicators remained strong, with a hefty increase in the share of owners planing to raise compensation. At the same time, small business owners are more inclined to cut prices than raise them to boost sluggish sales and weak profits.

""Inflationary pressures remain dormant on Main Street. A recovery in spending is the only way to create inflation,"" the NFIB said.

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) monthly survey of more than 400 firms showed its index of business conditions rose four points to +12 last month - its highest since early 2008. Its business confidence index climbed three points to +6.
The capacity utilization rate, a measure of the underlying health of the economy, climbed to 82.1 percent from 81.5 percent, to be comfortably above long-run averages.
All three components of business conditions - trade, profit and employment - improved. The employment measure jumped to +5 from +1.
""The very strong outcome in this month's NAB Business Survey provides strong evidence that the non-mining recovery has not been derailed by the financial market volatility and escalation in global economic concerns earlier in the year,"" said NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster.
""While the service sector is still a major driver of the recovery, this survey suggests that the improvements may be becoming more broad-based across the economy â particularly in construction and manufacturing.""
The report underpins NAB's relatively upbeat outlook for the economy and its expectations for monetary policy to remain on hold for an extended period.

At its policy review a week ago, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its cash rate steady at a record low 2.0 percent for a 10th straight policy meeting, citing evidence of continued growth at home.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2016 07:10PM ET</span>",UK consumers slow their spending in March: surveys,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers reined in their spending last month, according to two surveys published on Tuesday which added to signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.
The British Retail Consortium said retail sales failed to grow for the first time in nearly a year in March as the Easter holiday hit food sales because many supermarkets were closed on Easter Sunday.
The BRC's figures are not seasonally adjusted.
Food sales over the last three months fell by 0.7 percent, their biggest decline since June of last year.
But at the same time the holiday provided a boost to sales of furniture. Shoppers typically splash out on big-ticket items in the days after Easter.
BRC chief executive officer Helen Dickinson said the numbers were ""relatively disappointing,"" .
They also suggested that consumers were spending more money online rather than at shops and on leisure and entertainment which do not feature in the retail sales numbers, she said.
On a like-for-like basis, stripping out changes in the amount of retail space open to shoppers over the past 12 months, sales fell by 0.7 percent in March, their worst performance since August of last year.
British households have been the main engine of the country's economic recovery which began in 2013, helped by near-zero inflation, falling unemployment and gradually rising pay.
However, consumer confidence has weakened recently, possibly reflecting concerns about the global economy and Britain's referendum on its membership of the European Union which is due to take place on June 23.
Separate figures from credit and debit card firm Barclaycard published on Tuesday showed spending grew at its weakest pace in two years in March and the number of people feeling confident about the economy was its lowest since Barclaycard started collecting data in the third quarter of 2014.

""The continuing impact of global economic headwinds and an uncertain outlook really caught up with consumer spending in March,"" Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said.

Producer prices fell 4.3% year-on-year in March., less than the 4.6% decline expected. The Producer Price index gained 0.5% month-on-month in March, its first rise since January 2014 and compared with a decline of 0.3% in February.
""Looking ahead, we expect consumer price inflation to remain near current levels for the rest of this year,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""Admittedly, the fall in oil prices during the second half of 2015 will boost energy inflation later in the year and looser monetary and fiscal policy should also support broader price pressures. That said, the recent rise in pig numbers suggests that pork price inflation should begin to ease before long, which will help keep a lid on inflation. The upshot is that we donât expect inflation to become a constraint on policy in the near future.""
China's statistics bureau recalibrated the CPI index components in January in a once every-five-years review and the weighting of food in the index declined. Under the old weightings, the CPI gain in February and March may have topped 2.5%.
The government set the CPI growth target at about 2.3% for 2016, which serves as the ceiling of Premier Li Keqiang's reasonable range of economic growth.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2016 10:04PM ET</span>","China March consumer inflation stable, but producer prices fall again","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's consumer price inflation rose less than expected in March, flattening out after a four-month strengthening trend, but wholesale prices remained stubbornly in deflation.
Consumer prices in March rose 2.3 percent, below a median forecast of 2.5 percent in a Reuters poll but equal to February's increase of 2.3 percent. Although the prior month's figure represented the fastest rise in more than a year, the increase was driven largely by sharp gains in food prices following an unexpectedly harsh winter.
Economists have been watching closely to see how inflation evolves in China this year following a prolonged easing campaign by the central bank beginning in late 2014, which has boosted credit, but has yet to result in substantial price increases.
Producer prices fell 4.3 percent in March, extending their decline to a full four years, but at a slower rate than forecasts of a 4.6 percent decline. Falling commodity prices and overcapacity in key industrial sectors have helped mire producer prices in a lengthy slump, although declines have eased in recent months.
A key factor supporting consumer prices, which have trended sideways around 1.5 percent year-on-year since late 2014, has been the relative strength of the labour market.
However, recent data paints a mixed picture on conditions for China's workers. While the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for March showed job losses slowing, a separate private survey from Caixin showed deteriorating labour market conditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors.

China grew at its slowest pace in more than two decades in 2015, as the economy struggled with an extended correction in the real estate market, weak global demand and high corporate debt levels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy lost steam in the first three months of the year, according to a major survey of businesses that showed domestic demand slipped for both services and manufacturing companies.
The British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) Quarterly Economic Survey follows a string of lackluster data since the start of the year, with industrial output declining sharply and consumer confidence fading from highs seen last year.
Most of the BCC's key gauges either stagnated or fell. While they still pointed to modest economic growth, the business group warned of potential downside risks.
Domestic sales growth for manufacturers receded to the lowest level since the end of 2012, and for services this was the weakest since mid-2013.
And while manufacturing exports picked up slightly, the BCC's gauge of services exports slipped to its lowest since the end of 2011.
""From sales and orders to confidence and investment intentions, many of the business indicators we track are at a low ebb,"" the BCC's acting director general, Adam Marshall, said.
The BCC referred to ""mounting global and domestic uncertainties"" as reasons for the weaker outlook. It did not specifically mention Britain's June 23 referendum on membership of the European Union.
Last month the BCC's previous director general resigned after he breached the group's neutral stance on the referendum and spoke in favor of a British exit from the EU.
The BCC survey of more than 8,500 companies, the largest of its kind, painted a mixed picture of Britain's job market.
Pay pressures, a key determinant of policy for the Bank of England, eased overall.
Services companies that comprise the bulk of Britain's private sector economy reported the greatest staff recruitment difficulties for 18 years.
And while services companies took on staff during the first quarter at the slowest pace in two years, the proportion of them looking to expand their workforce in the coming three months improved.
Companies rolled back their plans to increase spending on training and machinery, suggesting policymakers may be frustrated in their hopes for a recovery led more strongly by business investment.
A separate survey from credit card company Visa Europe suggested consumer demand, a pillar of Britain's economic upturn since 2013, held up well during the first quarter.
Its inflation-adjusted gauge of consumer spending, based on card transactions data, rose 2.3 percent year-on-year in March, up slightly from 2.2 percent in February.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>","U.S. wholesale inventories fall sharply, point to weaker growth","WASHINGTON, April 8 (Reuters) - - U.S. wholesale inventories fell at their fastest pace in nearly three years in February, pointing to a sharper slowdown in first-quarter economic growth than previously thought.
Wholesale inventories dropped 0.5 percent in February, the Commerce Department said on Friday, the sharpest decline since May 2013. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a 0.1 percent decline.
The government also revised its reading for January to show a 0.2 percent decline in inventories rather than a 0.2 percent rise.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - dropped 0.4 percent in February.
Weak economic growth in the first quarter of recent years has led many analysts to wonder if the government is having trouble making seasonal adjustments to its data. Weak inventories in the first three months of the year could lead to catch-up growth in the economy in the second quarter as companies restock their shelves.
Economists generally expect the economy grew at less than a 1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down from a 1.4 percent rate in the last three months of 2015.
At February's sales pace, it would take 1.36 months to clear shelves compared with 1.37 months in January.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2016 10:53AM ET</span>",U.S. job market firming despite anemic economic growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting the labor market continued to strengthen despite tepid economic growth. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended April 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
""The persistently low level of claims should provide some reassurance that the economy is growing, even if that growth appears more sluggish that most would have hoped a few months ago,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Economists had forecast claims slipping to 270,000 in the latest week. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 57 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
The labor market buoyancy is at odds with slowing economic growth. Recent data on consumer spending, business investment and international trade suggest growth slowed to below a 1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter after expanding at an anemic 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
With the strengthening labor market drawing in discouraged and new job seekers, which is likely to keep wage growth moderate, it is unlikely the Federal Reserve will shift from its policy of gradually raising interest rates.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies after the claims data. U.S. stocks were trading lower, tracking falling oil prices, while U.S. Treasury debt prices rose.
MORE JOB SEEKERS
Government data last week showed about 2.4 million people entered or re-entered the job market between September and March, the second-largest increase in the labor force over a six-month period on record. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has argued that hidden labor market slack was restraining wage growth.
Fed officials last month downgraded their economic growth expectations and forecast only two more rate rises this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 policy meeting published on Wednesday suggested the central bank was unlikely to hike rates before June.
Last week, the four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 266,750.
""The labor market is on a solid footing. Layoffs are low, hiring is good, and workers who do lose their jobs are finding new ones quickly,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. 
Employers added 215,000 jobs in March, on top of the 245,000 positions created in February, the government reported last week. An increase in the labor force lifted the unemployment rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 5 percent.
A report on Tuesday showed hiring by U.S. employers surged in February to the highest level since November 2006. Nearly three million people voluntarily quit their jobs in February.

""The fears of world economic growth (slowing) are not causing a concern for business owners here in the U.S. with all the help wanted signs up in the windows,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

The committee held steady the policy fed funds rate at 0.25% to 0.50% on a 9-1 vote with George dissenting from the decision preferring instead the committee raise the target range for the rate to 0.50% to 0.75%.
""Most participants,"" which includes all 17 board members and regional Fed presidents, agreed with the voting majority that it was appropriate to keep the fed funds rate where it has been since December when the FOMC raised rates for the first time since 2006.

In a report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said their mortgage market index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.7% in the week ending April 1 to 472.8. That follows a fall of 1.0% to 460.5 in the preceding week.
Refinance volume jumped 7% week to week. ""This was the first increase in refinance activity after six weeks of declines,"" said MBA economist Joel Kan.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances declined to 3.86% from 3.94% in the preceding week.
""Rates fell last week as a more cautious message from Fed Chair Janet Yellen about the economic outlook and continuing concerns about weaker growth abroad kept demand for U.S. Treasurys high,"" Kan added.
The survey covers over 75% of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>",German industry output raises growth hopes for first quarter,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German economic growth looked set to accelerate in the first quarter of 2016 after official figures released on Wednesday showed industrial output fell less than expected in February.
Following the sector's jump in January, the surprisingly small dip gave analysts some relief after data on Tuesday showed industrial orders unexpectedly dropped in February due to weaker foreign demand, particularly from euro zone countries.
The global economic slowdown has also been causing concern for Germany's traditionally export-reliant economy.
Industrial output edged down 0.5 percent in February on the month after a revised 2.3 percent increase in January, data from the Economy Ministry showed. This was well above the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll for a 1.8 percent decline.
""Looking at January and February together, the picture is looking bright. Industrial production is pointing upward,"" Dekabank economist Andreas Scheuerle said, adding the data pointed to growth picking up to an estimated GDP rate of around 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
""But nobody should take this as a sure-fire success for the rest of the year. The problems on global sales markets are not solved yet,"" he added.
Capital Economics analyst Jonathan Loynes said February's figure provided a very solid platform for the first quarter. Even if production was to fall around 1 percent in March, this would still leave a solid gain for the whole quarter, he noted.
""That, in turn, could potentially lift the quarterly rate of German GDP growth from Q4's 0.3 percent to around 0.7 percent in Q1,"" Loynes added.
A breakdown of the February data showed construction firms posting strong gains while the energy sector and factories producing consumer and capital goods reported weaker output.
""Overall, the industrial sector got off to a relatively good start in 2016 although seasonal factors led to shifts in production and the construction sector benefited from the mild winter,"" the Economy Ministry noted.
The manufacturing and construction sectors are expected to post solid gains in the first quarter, the ministry added.
The booming construction sector is currently one of the main growth drivers in Germany. In the last three months of 2015, construction investment and state spending were the two biggest growth contributors while net foreign trade was a drag.
In the whole of 2015, strong private consumption and higher state spending drove an economic expansion of 1.7 percent. But analysts doubt that growth this year will surpass that pace.

The country's leading economic institutes will update their joint growth forecast for 2016 on April 14 and the government is expected to publish its own updated forecast on April 20.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>",China March services activity picks up but jobs fall: Caixin PMI,"SHANGHAI, April 6 (Reuters) - - Activity in China's service sector strengthened in March, but employment fell for the first time in over 2.5 years, a private survey showed, sending mixed signals on the health of a sector which Beijing is counting on to offset prolonged weakness in manufacturing.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for March rose to 52.2 from February's 51.2, as new business continued to expand modestly.
The employment sub-component, however, slipped to 48.9 from 51.3, pointing to the first contraction in staffing levels since August 2013.
A number of firms said they were not replacing staff who left voluntarily, while some others said they were downsizing due to muted growth in new business, the survey said.
Readings above 50 indicate an expansion on a monthly basis, while readings below indicate contraction.
""Overall, the services sector developed well, but the economy is riding choppy waves, indicating the lack of a solid foundation for a recovery,"" He Fan, chief economist at Caixin, said in a note.
""The government needs to push forward with 'supply-side reform' to encourage the development of emerging industries.""
Recently announced government plans to cut excess capacity in struggling industrial sectors such as coal and steel are likely to result in nearly two million layoffs, according to statements by policymakers.
Beijing hopes many of those workers can be retrained or shunted into other sectors such as services, farming or forestry, keeping the threat of mass unemployment in check.
But the Caixin surveys suggest the downdraft from manufacturing is still intense.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI showed a return to growth in March, with the headline figure rising to 51.3 in March from 49.4 in February, helped by an unexpected improvement in the manufacturing sector.
But the composite employment figure dipped to 47.6, the lowest reading since January 2009 and the 10th straight month of contraction.
Some economists have cautioned that China's lengthy industrial slowdown would eventually begin to impact the service sector, too, as pinched manufacturing firms and workers begin to cut back on spending.
Both China's official and private Caixin factory readings showed manufacturers continued to shed jobs last month, but differed on whether the pace of layoffs was moderating.

The official survey suggested the job losses may be slowing, with the reading at the highest since June, but the Caixin survey showed manufacturers shedding staff for the 29th straight month and at almost the same pace as in February.

The British Retail Consortium said shop prices eased by 1.7 percent year-on-year in March, the smallest fall since August 2015, slowing from a 2.0 percent drop in February.
The decline in non-food prices slowed in March, easing an annual 2.6 percent last month from a 3.0 percent decrease in February. Food prices declined 0.4 percent year-on-year for the second straight month.
The fall in overall shop prices was ""a result of continuing intense competition and retailers ongoing investment in price,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.
""Despite consumer confidence remaining at zero, a relatively benign economic environment and a fiercely competitive market will see retailers continue to respond to their customers with prices and promotions to maintain market share as the Spring season kicks off.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in February as a rebound in exports was offset by an increase in imports, the latest indication that economic growth weakened further in the first quarter.
But the growth picture should brighten in the months ahead, with other data on Tuesday showing that activity in the vast services sector picked up in March as new orders rose strongly, and sustained strength in the labor market.
""There are some green shoots appearing this spring in the economic data which makes us more confident that 2016 is going to be a good year after a step-down in expectations and hopes at the start of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at 
MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit increased 2.6 percent to $47.1 billion in February, worse than economists' forecasts for a reading of $46.2 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the shortfall rose to $63.3 billion, the largest since March last year, from $61.8 billion in January.
That prompted economists to cut their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 0.4 percent annualized rate.
They see trade subtracting at least seven-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter, up from 0.14 point in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the final three months of 2015. Â Â Â Â Though the trade report joined data on consumer and business spending in casting a dark shadow over the economy, the clouds could lift in the coming months.
STRONG SERVICES ACTIVITY
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its services industry activity index increased 1.1 points to 54.5 in March. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Services industries reported an increase in new orders. A measure of orders for services exports jumped five points to 58.5, a positive sign for overall U.S. exports.
A third report from the Labor Department showed hiring by U.S. employers increased 297,000 to 5.4 million in February, the highest level since November 2006. Underscoring the strength and confidence in the labor market, 2.95 million people voluntarily quit their jobs in February, lifting the quit rate to 2.1 percent. 
The Federal Reserve looks at the quit rate as a measure of confidence in the jobs market and it is hoped that increased labor market churn will drive up wages.
""For the most part, today's reports point to a domestic economy that is in good shape.Â First-quarter growth looks like it may be a little less solid than hoped for, but the underlying data indicate all is still well,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell. U.S. government debt prices rose.
In February, exports of goods rose 1.6 percent, increasing for the first time since September. Overall exports of goods and services advanced 1.0 percent.
Exports have been undercut by a buoyant dollar, which has made U.S.-manufactured goods expensive relative to those of the country's main trading partners. Slowing growth in Europe and China has also eroded demand for U.S. goods. 
But with the dollar rally fading, February's nascent increase in exports could be sustained. A survey last week showed a gauge of new export orders received by factories rose in March to its highest level since December 2014.
The dollar is down 1.3 percent on a trade-weighted basis so far this year after gaining about 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015.
""The recent dollar depreciation should lead to some strengthening in exports. But at this point, it is not clear if the solid gain in exports in February represents a change in the underlying trend or simply reflects noise in the series,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
In February, exports of food, automobiles and parts, as well as consumer goods increased. But exports of industrial supplies and materials were the lowest in nearly six years. Capital goods exports hit their lowest level since November 2011. Petroleum exports were the lowest since September 2010.
Imports of goods and services rose 1.3 percent in February, suggesting strong domestic demand. However, lower oil prices and increased domestic energy production are keeping the import bill in check. 
Food imports hit a record high in February. But imports of industrial supplies and materials were the lowest in nearly seven years. Petroleum imports touched their lowest level since September 2002. Oil prices averaged $27.48 per barrel in February, the cheapest since December 2003.

The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 2.8 percent to $28.1 billion in February.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS Services Purchasing Managers Index rose to 53.7 last month from a reading of 52.7 in February that was close to a three-year low. Analysts had expected the index to increase to 53.7 in March.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Despite the slight advance from February levels, March rounded off the weakest quarter of output growth in the British services sector since the first quarter of 2013.
The data also revealed the slowest increase in new business since January 2013.
Meanwhile, charges levied by service providers rose at the fastest pace in over two years.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson pointed out that the upturn in the pace of the surface sector growth was insufficient to prevent PMI surveys from collectively indicating a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter and forecast GDP growth of 0.4%, compared to the 0.6% expansion in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, Williamson said that business confidence remained weak due to concerns about the global economy and nerves on edge due to the upcoming referendum on the U.K.âs membership in the European Union or further government spending cuts announced in the budget.
He also noted that it was unlikely that Marchâs upturn in the pace of growth represented the start of a longer-term upswing and forecast that growth is likely to weaken further in the second quarter.
âWith the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off,â Williamson added.

LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth edged up last month from February's 13-month low as demand weakened, particularly for services, despite deep price cuts, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The Purchasing Managers Index will make disappointing reading for European Central Bank policymakers, coming just weeks after they eased policy on a wide front in their latest attempt to spur growth and inflation.
But Markit's final composite PMI for the bloc, seen as a good guide to growth, suggested the stimulus had not yet had much effect. At 53.1, the index barely improved on February's 53.0. That was above the 50-mark that divides growth from contraction but down from an earlier flash estimate of 53.7.
""The euro zone economy failed to show any significant gain in momentum in March. With the PMI barely rising from February's 13-month low, the region looks to have grown by just 0.3 percent again in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
A Reuters poll in March predicted the economy expanded 0.4 percent last quarter.
More worryingly for policymakers, companies cut prices again last month. The output price index nudged up to 48.6 from February's 12-month low of 48.5.
The ECB would like inflation just below 2 percent, but flash data showed last week it was -0.1 percent in March. Meanwhile, producer prices fell more than expected in February and the pace of their monthly decline increased, excluding volatile energy prices.
Price cutting failed to stem a slide in the PMI for the bloc's dominant service industries. The index fell to a 14-month low of 53.1 from 53.3, a decline from the flash 54.0 estimate.
New business growth also decelerated, and the sub-index fell to a 14-month low of 52.7 from February's 53.4. 
""Sluggish growth is the result of lackluster demand, accompanied by falling prices as firms compete at the expense of profit margins. Not surprisingly, hiring is coming under increased pressure as firms struggle to contain costs,"" Williamson said.
Unemployment in the euro zone was 10.3 percent in February, just down from an upward revised 10.4 percent in January, official data showed on Monday.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2016 01:04AM ET</span>","Australia central bank holds rates, eyes local dollar","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held interest rates steady for a 10th straight policy meeting on Tuesday, citing evidence of continued growth at home despite an unhelpful rise in the local dollar.
Bucking the worldwide charge toward negative rates, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept its cash rate at 2 percent in a widely expected decision.
Again the door was left open to an easing should developments in inflation, unemployment or the global economy warrant it, but there was little sign a move might be imminent.
""The Board judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy,"" RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said in a brief statement.
""Continued low inflation would provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.""
In a Reuters poll of 41 analysts, all had expected no change in the cash rate this week.
The one major change to the statement was to note that the Aussie dollar had risen recently, in part due to policy easing by other central banks.
""Under present circumstances, an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment under way in the economy,"" said Stevens.
Some investors had wagered he would offer a more full-throated protest at the rise in the currency, which climbed 7 percent against a broadly weaker U.S. dollar in March.
The resulting unwinding of short positions saw the Aussie pop up to $0.7615 <AUD=D4>, from $0.7583 just ahead of the RBA decision.
Stevens's reticence might reflect a judgment that Australian yields were always going to be attractive when so much of the world was going sub-zero. Australian 10-year debt pays 2.45 percent while Japan offers a return of minus 8 basis points.
Much the same is happening in neighbor New Zealand.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand shocked many by cutting rates early in March, complaining that its currency was unjustifiably high. Yet after an initial slide, the kiwi soon rallied and ended the month higher than where it began.
Still, investors suspect a further rise in the Aussie, say above 80 U.S. cents, could force a rethink on rates. Inflation figures for the first quarter are due on April 27 and a low result would provide a perfect domestic excuse to cut.
Interbank futures <0#YIB:> imply around a 32 percent probability of an easing in May, rising to 66 percent by August.
""It's critical that trade-exposed sectors like tourism and higher education contribute to growth over the year ahead but the rise in the Aussie is a threat to this,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital.

""The best way for the RBA to check the threat is to ramp up its jawboning to get the Aussie down again and to ultimately cut interest rates.""

1152,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2016 12:36AM ET</span>","RBA hold steady at 2.0% as expected, awaits new labor data","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate at a record low 2.0% as expected on Tuesday, but noted that new information should allow a better assessment of the labor market.
For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
Recent information suggests that the global economy is continuing to grow, though at a slightly lower pace than earlier expected. While several advanced economies have recorded improved growth over the past year, conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate has continued to moderate.
Commodity prices have generally increased a little recently, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
Sentiment in financial markets has improved recently after a period of heightened volatility. However, uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy settings among the major jurisdictions continues.
Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy is continuing to rebalance following the mining investment boom. Consistent with developments in the labour market, overall GDP growth picked up over 2015, despite the contraction in mining investment. The pace of lending to businesses has also picked up.
Inflation is quite low. Recent information has confirmed that growth in labour costs remains quite subdued. Given this, and with inflation also restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation in Australia is likely to remain low over the next year or two.
Given these conditions, it is appropriate for monetary policy to be accommodative. Low interest rates are supporting demand, while supervisory measures are working to emphasise prudent lending standards and so to contain risks in the housing market. Credit growth to households continues at a moderate pace, albeit with a changed composition between investors and owner-occupiers. The pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney and has remained mostly subdued in other cities.
The Australian dollar has appreciated somewhat recently. In part, this reflects some increase in commodity prices, but monetary developments elsewhere in the world have also played a role. Under present circumstances, an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment under way in the economy.
At today's meeting, the Board judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore decided that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate.
Over the period ahead, new information should allow the Board to assess the outlook for inflation and whether the improvement in labour market conditions evident last year is continuing. Continued low inflation would provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2016 08:10PM ET</span>",Japan February real wages rise 0.4 percent year-on-year,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wages rose in February from a year earlier on an inflation-adjusted basis for the first time in four months, data showed on Tuesday, in a positive sign that consumer spending may pick up.
Wage rises are crucial to the government's efforts to stoke demand and defeat deflation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly urged companies to lift worker compensation, particularly base pay, so that households can increase spending.
Real wages, adjusted for inflation, in February rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the first rise since October, data from the labour ministry showed.
Nominal cash earnings in February rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier, also the first gain in four months. Regular pay, which determines base salaries, rose an annual 0.6 percent, the data showed.
Overtime pay rose an annual 0.4 percent, the data showed.
Special payments rose 25.7 percent in February from a year earlier. This was the biggest gain since May 2011, reflecting an increase in payments for commuting costs that companies subsidize, a labour ministry official said.
Compared to cash earnings and base pay, special payments are generally very small, so even a slight change in the yen amount can lead to big percentage changes, the official also said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell in February and business spending on capital goods was much weaker than initially thought, the latest indications that economic growth slowed further in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Monday new orders for manufactured goods declined 1.7 percent as demand fell broadly, reversing January's downwardly revised 1.2 percent increase. Orders have declined in 14 of the last 19 months. They were previously reported to have increased 1.6 percent in January.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft fell by a steeper 2.5 percent in February instead of the 1.8 percent drop reported last month. These so-called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans. 
""This morning's report suggests a more sluggish manufacturing sector in the early part of the quarter,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
The report added to weak consumer spending and trade data in suggesting economic growth moderated further at the turn of the year after slowing to a 1.4 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter. Estimates for first-quarter gross domestic product growth are currently below a 1 percent rate.
U.S. government bond prices were little changed after the data, while the dollar fell to a two-week low against the yen. U.S. stocks were trading marginally lower. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been pressured by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undermined exports of factory goods, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang. 
The sector has also been slammed by investment cuts by energy firms as they adjust to reduced profits from cheaper oil.
MANUFACTURING STABILIZING
But the worst of the factory slump appears to be over, with a survey last week showing manufacturing activity expanded in March for the first time in six months. 
After gaining about 20 percent versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015, the greenback is flat on a trade-weighted basis so far this year. In addition, the slide in oil prices has slowed.
""We remain hopeful for some upcoming improvement in the data as many of these headwinds have either passed or faded,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""We have also been encouraged somewhat by some other more timely manufacturing indicators that have turned more mixed lately following a period of more widespread and severe weakness.""
In February, factory orders fell broadly, with orders for transportation equipment tumbling 6.2 percent. Orders for machinery dropped 3.4 percent and bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components decreased 3.6 percent.
The Commerce Department also said shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, fell 1.7 percent in February rather than the 1.1 percent reported last month.
Inventories of factory goods dropped for an eighth straight month, suggesting factories were making progress in reducing the inventory glut. While that could support future manufacturing production, it suggests inventories remained a drag on economic growth in the first quarter.

The inventories-to-shipments ratio was 1.37 in February, unchanged from the prior month. Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.3 percent in February, while shipments of manufactured goods, which have declined in 10 of the last 11 months, fell 0.7 percent.

In a report, the U.S. Census Bureau said factory orders declined by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% last month, in line with the consensus forecast. Factory orders rose 1.2% in January, revised from the initial read of a 1.6% increase.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2016 05:20AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer prices fall by more than expected in February ,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices fell by more than expected in February and the pace of their monthly decline increased, excluding volatile energy prices, data from the European Union's statistics office Eurostat showed on Monday.
Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro currency dropped by 0.7 percent month-on-month for a 4.2 percent year-on-year decline. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected a 0.5 percent month-on-month drop.
Excluding the 2.1 percent fall in energy, producer prices were down 0.2 percent in February, compared to 0.1 percent in January.
This was mainly because of falling prices for non-durable consumer goods and a decline in price increases for durable consumer goods, the only sector still to show price increases.
Energy prices, which had still fallen by 3.7 percent month-on-month in January were down -2.1 percent in February
While the data is two months old, it shows the struggle the European Central Bank is facing in bring consumer price inflation back to its target of below but close to 2 percent over a two-year horizon.
The bank has been printing money to buy euro zone government bonds over the last 12 months to inject more cash into the economy and accelerate price growth.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned European leaders last month that monetary policy alone would not be enough to jump-start the economy and that governments needed to do their job by pushing through structural reforms.

(Reuters) - U.S. small business borrowing rose 17 percent in February, data released on Monday showed, making up for ground lost over the past several months that had raised prospects of weak economic growth ahead.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index jumped to 138 in February from January's downward-revised 117.7, the lowest level in nearly two years. The PayNet index typically corresponds to U.S. gross domestic product growth one or two quarters ahead.
Borrowing and investment have ""come back to life,"" said Bill Phelan, president of PayNet, adding that he expects lending growth to ""plod along"" rather than boom in coming months.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because little firms tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Loans more than 30 days past due fell in February to 1.47 percent, separate data from PayNet showed. The decline suggests improving financial health even as companies borrow more.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased solidly in March, underscoring the economy's resilience, but an influx of Americans into the labor market could temper nascent wage growth and keep the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 215,000 last month and the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent from an eight-year low of 4.9 percent, the Labor Department said on Friday. The jobless rate edged up as more people continued to enter or re-enter the labor market, a sign of confidence in the jobs market.
Average hourly earnings gained seven cents after slipping in February. The labor market has largely shrugged off slowing global economic growth, a robust U.S. dollar that has hurt manufacturing exports, and the negative impact of cheap oil prices on the energy sector.
Economists see limited impact on monetary policy in the near-term from the strong jobs report, as the growing number of labor market entrants supported Fed Chair Janet Yellen's view that there was still hidden slack in the jobs market.
""The rise in participation is creating breathing room, allowing the Fed to react very slowly to a strong labor market,"" said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
The Fed also appears to be more focused on international developments. Yellen said this week that slowing world growth and lower oil prices posed a downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook, adding that she considered it appropriate for policymakers to ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.""
Fed officials last month downgraded their economic growth expectations and forecast only two more rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Financial markets see a 30 percent chance of a hike at the Fed's June policy meeting, a 50 percent chance of such a move in September and a 64 percent probability at the December meeting, according to CME FedWatch.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing 205,000 in March and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.9 percent. The economy created 1,000 fewer jobs in January and February than previously reported.
U.S. Treasury prices fell after the data, while the dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading higher.
The jobs report came on the heels of recent data showing sluggish consumer spending and weak business investment on capital in the first two months of the year, as well as deterioration in the international trade balance.
Those reports prompted economists to slash their first-quarter GDP growth estimates to as low as a 0.9 percent annualized pace from as high as a 2.0 percent rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Other data on Friday showed manufacturing activity expanded in March for the first time in six months as new orders surged, suggesting the worst of the factory rout was over. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose 2.3 points to a reading of 51.8 in March.
WAGES BOUNCE BACK
Though employment gains have slowed after averaging 282,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter, there is little labor market strain from the global slowdown, which helped to ignite a massive stock market sell-off at the start of the year.
Wages increased last month, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3 percent. That lifted the year-on-year earnings gain to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in February, a welcome development after the recent wobble in consumer sentiment.
Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. Though the Fed's preferred inflation measure is currently at 1.7 percent, Yellen has expressed skepticism over the sustainability of gains, citing transitory factors.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose a tenth of a percentage point to 63 percent in March, the highest level since March 2014.
It has increased 0.6 percentage point since dipping to 62.4 percent in September. About 2.4 million people entered or re-entered the job market since September, the second-largest increase in the labor force over a six-month period on record.
""This sharp rise in the labor force can only mean formerly frustrated people are coming back to the labor market as their jobs prospects have improved,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
But a broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment rose to 9.8 percent last month from a more than 7-1/2-year low of 9.7 percent.
Employment gains in March were broad-based. Manufacturing, however, lost 29,000 jobs, the largest number since December 2009, despite signs of stabilization in the factory sector.
Mining purged 12,000 more jobs last month. Mining payrolls have declined by 185,000 jobs since peaking in September 2014, with three-fourths of the losses in support activities.
Oilfield services providers Schlumberger (N:SLB) and  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) have announced thousands of job cuts as they try to cope with reduced profits from a prolonged slump in oil prices.

Construction payrolls rose 37,000, increasing for a ninth straight month. Retail employment surged 47,700 after rising strongly in January and February despite weak sales. Government payrolls increased 20,000 last month.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Central European manufacturing continued to grow in March as a jump in Polish factory activity managed to offset slower growth from Germany, the region's main trade partner.
The former communist countries of the European Union's eastern wing rely on demand and investment from richer western Europe, which over the past two decades has lifted their living standards.
But as the euro zone growth remains weak, central European countries have begun diversifying their exports and taking measures to boost domestic consumption, to keep their economies on a growth path.
""The big picture ... is that the PMIs suggest that manufacturing activity in central Europe remains strong,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Manufacturing in Poland, the region's largest economy, expanded at the fastest rate in eight months in March, driven by quicker growth in new orders, output, exports and employment, Markit said on Friday.
Poland's manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index rose to 53.8 last month from 52.8 in February, Markit said on Friday. The figure exceeded all 15 forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters.
In the Czech Republic, the manufacturing PMI eased to 54.3 in March from 55.5 in February, still above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
Also in Hungary, where the PMI index is calculated under a different methodology, the index fell to 51.7 in March from a revised 54.6 in February, suggesting a possible slowdown in German industry.
Demand from the euro zone accounts for about 60 percent of Czech, Hungarian and Polish exports, and a German PMI showed on Friday that its manufacturers ended their weakest quarter in more than a year in March, a sign Europe's biggest economy may be feeling the pinch from a global slowdown.
""The fact that the Polish PMI rose further supports our view that it will be one of the best performing economies in the region this year,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Poland's $480 billion economy expanded by 3.9 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, and economists expect it to grow 3.6 percent in 2016, helped by its new government's increase in public spending.

Poland's ruling party on Friday began a new child benefit program valued at about 1 percent of GDP this year, which will be financed by one of European Union's highest bank asset taxes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone factories rounded off the first quarter in slightly better shape than initially thought but growth in activity remained weak despite the deepest price-cutting since late 2009, a survey showed on Friday.
The surveys suggest manufacturing is still dragging on the wider economy, and growth remained weak in Germany while activity contracted in France. But Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and in particular Ireland saw robust expansions.
Last month, the European Central Bank unleashed a bold easing package in its latest attempt to spur growth and drive up inflation - which at -0.1 percent in March was nowhere near its 2 percent target goal - but it doesn't seem to be working yet.
""The data suggest manufacturing grew by only around 0.2 percent in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit
""Policymakers will also be worried by the further intensification of deflationary pressures in manufacturing supply chains. Discounting was widespread as firms competed on price amid weak demand.""
Despite the price-cutting and ECB stimulus, Markit's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone only rose to 51.6 from February's year-low of 51.2.
That was slightly better than an earlier flash estimate of 51.4 and above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
A sub-index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday and is seen as a good guide to growth, climbed to 53.1 from 52.3, which was also a one-year low. The flash reading was 52.7.
The output price index came in below the flash reading of 47.4 at 47.1 and was well down on February's 47.6. The latest result was the lowest since December 2009.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2016 04:51AM ET</span>",China official factory activity unexpectedly expands but job losses mount,"By Nathaniel Taplin and Pete Sweeney
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in March for the first time in nine months, an official survey showed on Friday, adding to hopes that downward pressure on the world's second-largest economy is easing.
But while output rose and new orders from home and abroad returned to growth, factories still shed jobs at a significant rate, highlighting the risks for leaders in Beijing as they try to cut industrial overcapacity without sparking massive layoffs.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.2 in March, up from February's 49 but still only marginally above the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction. The findings handily beat expectations for a further contraction. 
Economists said a more than one-year blitz of stimulus measures may finally be showing some dividends, particularly steps to revive the ailing property market, with now surging home sales boosting demand for materials from cement to steel.
A government spending spree on infrastructure, while slower to get going, now seems to be having a similar effect.
However, China watchers said more support will still be needed from Beijing and the central bank in the form of higher spending and interest rate cuts as the economy is likely to remain weak.
Indeed, a similar private survey by Caixin and Markit, which focuses on smaller firms, showed manufacturing activity shrank again in March, though at the slowest pace in 13 months. 
""The output and new order categories rose above the neutral 50-point level, indicating that the stimulus policies the government has implemented have begun to take hold,"" noted Caixin chief economist He Fan.
""However, considering current conditions remain uncertain, the government needs to continue with moderate stimulus measures to reinforce market confidence."" 
The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) found that output, total new orders and output prices all returned to growth for the first time in well over half a year.
""It does seem to indicate manufacturing is warming up a bit, new orders were...a very strong figure,"" said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. 
""We think there are basically two factors driving the recovery: the first is a possible acceleration in infrastructure spending; the second is a broader pickup in external demand.""
Yeung said China's economy could grow 6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, cooling from 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter but better than many had expected just a month or two ago. First-quarter data is due on April 15.
JOB LOSSES IN FOCUS
Both the official and private factory readings showed manufacturers continued to shed jobs last month, but disagreed on whether on whether layoffs were moderating.
The official survey suggested the rate of job losses may be slowly easing, with the reading at the highest since June, but the Caixin survey showed manufacturers shedding staff for the 29th straight month and at almost the same pace as in February.
Data from the recent China Beige Book quarterly survey showed firms cutting back sharply on hiring and wage hikes, risking a blow to domestic consumption that could hamper any further recovery.
Sources have told Reuters that China is expecting to lay off 5-6 million state workers over the next two to three years as it tries to cut bloated industrial capacity and pollution, though officials say many of those can be retrained for jobs being created in the services sector.
TOUGH TRANSITION FROM ""OLD ECONOMY"" DRIVERS
Hopes that the long-suffering manufacturing sector may be bottoming out were fuelled by recent data which showed industrial profits rose 4.8 percent in the first two months of 2016 from a year earlier, ending seven months of decline.
China's real estate investment rose 3 percent in the first two months of 2016 in year-on-year terms, quickening from an increase of just 1 percent in all of 2015, though a huge overhang of unsold homes could keep further market gains in check.
Global energy and commodity prices also have staged a limited recovery in recent weeks, which may have bolstered flagging profits at oil and mining firms and reduced strains on their balance sheets.
In addition to the boost from a pick-up in construction activity at home, cash-starved Chinese mills have also been exporting large amounts of steel, which has sparked accusations of dumping from some of its top trading partners.
Finally, some analysts say business confidence may have improved as fears of a sharp depreciation in the value of the yuan currency have eased.
Adding to the cautiously optimistic mood, growth in China's services sector expanded strongly.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in March from the previous month's 52.7.
That is good news for China's leaders as they try to overhaul the economy into one less dependent on exports and rust-belt industries and more driven by domestic consumption.
With manufacturing in a prolonged slump, services have been a crucial source of growth and jobs for China over the past year.
Rating agency S&P cut its outlook for China's sovereign credit rating on Thursday to negative, saying the government's reform agenda is likely to proceed more slowly than expected.
But signs of improvement in the economy, however modest, could give Beijing more breathing room to keep those reforms on track.

1190,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2016 04:31AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI rebounds from a 34-month low in March,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the U.K. rebounded in March from a 34-month low hit in the prior month, but came in under forecasts, industry data showed on Friday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.0 last month from a reading of 50.8 in February. Analysts had expected the index to advance slightly more to 51.2 in February.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
In the report, Markit noted that the first quarter of 2016 registered one its weakest performances in the past three years.
Output growth was unchanged from Februaryâs seven-month low.
Manufacturing job losses declined for a third straight month.
Commenting on the report, Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said, âThe UK manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums during the opening quarter of the year.â
âAlthough March saw modest improvements in the trends for production and new orders, industry is still hovering close to the stagnation mark and will struggle to make a meaningful contribution to the next set of GDP growth figures,â he added.

GBP/USD was trading at 1.4355 from around 1.4356 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was also unchanged at 0.7937.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were broadly lower. Londonâs FTSE 100 lost 1.00%, the EURO STOXX 50 gave up 1.59%, France's CAC 40 slumped 1.56%, while Germany's DAX traded down 1.38%."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Activity in China's vast factory sector grew for the first time in nine months in March to bring a hint of Spring to the global economy, though a renewed chill in Japanese industry led to a muted response in financial markets.
Surveys due later on Friday are also expected to show a continued expansion in activity in Europe, while the United States should enjoy a return to growth after five months of contraction and another strong jobs report. 
Headlining in Asia was a rise in the official version of the Chinese Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 50.2, beating forecasts and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
The private Caixin/Markit PMI found output, total new orders and output prices all returned to growth, while a survey of the service sector surprised with its strength. 
""It does seem to indicate that the manufacturing sector is warming up a bit,"" said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. ""New orders were up 2.8 points, which is a very strong figure.""
""We think there are basically two factors driving the recovery: the first is a possible acceleration in infrastructure spending. The second is a broader pickup in external demand.""
That should be of some comfort to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen who this week cited the global risks emanating from China as one reason to be cautious on raising U.S. rates.
Yet, China watchers still suspect more support will be needed from Beijing, especially if it wants to avoid a politically unsettling rise in unemployment. 
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's underlined the need for faster reform when it changed China's credit outlook to negative on Thursday.
JAPAN GOES BACKWARDS
The economic pulse across the rest of Asia was more erratic. South Korea's PMI bounced to within a whisker of 50 in March while stronger shipments of smartphones and steel saw exports decline at the slowest pace in four months.
Indonesia put an end to 17 straight months of contraction as its PMI popped up to 50.6, with output, new orders and employment all improving.
Japan, however, was busy going backwards as the Markit/Nikkei PMI of 49.1 was the lowest since February 2013.
That echoed a gloomy survey of manufacturers from the Bank of Japan which found sentiment at its darkest in nearly three years, a result that lopped 3 percent off the Nikkei (N225).
All of which heightened pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the central bank to do more to shore up the stuttering economy.
""This data confirmed the very cautious stance of Japanese firms reflecting the market volatility since January. There's no signs of corporate sentiment bottoming in coming months,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities.
""There's more than a 50 percent chance the BOJ will consider easing policy further this month."" 
Analysts are hoping for better news from Europe and the U.S. later in the session. The euro zone version of the PMI is expected to hold at 51.4 for March, with growth seen spreading from Germany to Italy to Spain. 
The influential U.S. reading from the Institute of Supply Management was forecast to rebound to 50.7 and back above 50 for the first time since August. 

The always-pivotal nonfarm payrolls report is also expected to show a healthy increase of 205,000 in March and perhaps a much-needed pick up in wage earnings.

The Markit/Nikkei Final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, unchanged from a preliminary reading and below the final 50.1 in February.
The reading fell below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since April last year, and contracted at the fastest pace since February 2013.
The sub-index for new export orders sank to 46.1, above the flash reading of 45.9 but still well below the 49.0 recorded in February. New export orders contracted at the fastest since January 2013.
Factory output contracted, albeit mildly, for the first time since April 2015, after growth slowed sharply in February.
That has increased the chances that the economy is in a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product.

Japan's government is considering extra fiscal stimulus to pull the economy out of its funk, and there is a growing chance it will delay a sales tax hike scheduled for next year to ease the burden on domestic demand.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Japan's big manufacturers deteriorated to the lowest in nearly three years and is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, a closely watched central bank survey showed on Friday, heightening pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan to do more to shore up the ailing economy.
Big firms also plan to cut capital expenditure plans in the current fiscal year, underscoring the challenges the BOJ faces in aggressively printing money to nudge risk-shy companies into boosting spending.
To keep the economy afloat, Abe may have to delay yet again a sales tax hike scheduled for next year.
The weak reading will also keep the BOJ under pressure to loosen monetary policy further when it reviews its quarterly forecasts later this month, some analysts say.
""This data confirmed the very cautious stance of Japanese firms reflecting the market volatility since January. There's no signs of corporate sentiment bottoming in coming months,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities.
""There's more than a 50 percent chance the BOJ will consider easing policy further this month.""
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 6 in March, half the level seen three months ago and worse than a median market forecast of plus 8, the survey showed.
It was the lowest reading since June 2013, as exporters felt the pinch from sluggish emerging market demand and yen rises that erode their competitive advantage overseas.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment dropped to plus 22 from plus 25 three months ago, deteriorating for the first time in six quarters, as spending by overseas visitors moderated.
Sentiment soured for manufacturers and non-manufacturers big and small for the first time since June 2014, when Japan was reeling from the blow of a sales tax hike in April of that year.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect sentiment to worsen in the coming three months, underscoring companies' concern over the murky global economic outlook.
""The slowdown in emerging economies, particularly that of China, has affected business sentiment. The impact was big for big manufacturers with direct exposure to global economic conditions,"" a BOJ official told reporters in a briefing.
The yen's rise is also expected to hurt profits.
Big manufacturers based their business plans on the assumption the dollar would average 117.46 yen in the current fiscal year, higher than recent levels around 112 yen, suggesting that corporate profits could be revised down ahead.
In a sign uncertainty over the global outlook is hurting companies' spending plans, big firms plan to cut capital expenditure by 0.9 percent for the current fiscal year from year-before levels.
Japan's economy shrank in October-December due to weak exports and consumption. Many analysts now expect it to have contracted again in January-March, which would put the country back into recession, commonly defined as two straight quarters of negative growth.
The gloomy survey will add pressure on the BOJ to do more to prop up growth, though many central bankers are reluctant to ease again soon with financial institutions still struggling to digest the impact of January's controversial decision to adopt negative interest rates.
The tankan showed financial institutions' sentiment deteriorating sharply in March, most likely due to the pain they are feeling from negative rates and dwindling profit margins. 

The government, for its part, is already considering compiling a fresh fiscal stimulus package and delaying next year's sales tax hike to prevent external factors from disrupting a fragile economic recovery.

Earlier, the March CFLP manufacturing gauge in China rose into expansion territory on Friday, surprising on the upside and setting the stage for a more closely-watched measure. The February figures were affected by a week-long holiday in the month to mark the Chinese New Year.
The semi-official CFLP manufacturing PMI for March came in at 50.2, compared to 49.3 seen and a final 49 in February, representing the first gain above 50 in eight months and its strongest since 50.3 in November 2014. March is typically a period of strong business activity in China because construction resumes. The CFLP non-manufacturing index came in at 53.8, compared to 52.7 for the final in February.
""Today's better-than-expected PMI readings are consistent with our long-held view that policy easing will result in a cyclical upturn in Chinaâs economy this year,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""The main components of both manufacturing PMIs all rose last month, with the biggest increases in the new orders components. This appears to reflect an improvement in both domestic and external demand, with the export orders sub-indices also rising though by a smaller margin.""

The Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) on South Korea's manufacturing sector inched up to 49.5 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis from a six-month low of 48.7 in February, data from Markit Economic showed.
A reading below 50 indicates activity during the surveyed month contracted from the previous month, while levels above 50 point to expansion.
Reflecting still sluggish global demand, a sub-index on new export orders received by South Korean manufacturers ticked down to 49.3 in March from 49.6 in February in a second month of contraction.
But total new orders - covering both domestic and export demand - showed some signs of stabilising and were unchanged after shrinking for two months. 
Another sub-index showed input prices at South Korean manufacturers increased in March for the first time in 19 months to 51.0 from 46.3 in February, indicating inflationary pressures intensified.
Most market players expect the Bank of Korea to cut interest rates again to give the economy a push, but recent remarks by policymakers and economic indicators have been increasing the chances that the bank may sit pat at its next policy meeting on April 19.
South Korea's central bank chief Lee Ju-yeol reiterated on Wednesday that its current monetary policy is supportive of growth but propped the door open to possible easing in future by adding the economy is recovering at a slower pace than earlier thought.

Analysts had initially said the central bank could cut at any time should the economy require more stimulus, but stronger-than-expected February industrial output data on Thursday may give the BOK more reason to pause, they said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's annual inflation was lower in March than expected as low oil prices continued to keep down costs, data on Friday showed, while a sustained rise in services suggested consumption is steadily mending.
The consumer price index gained 1.0 percent in March from a year earlier, Statistics Korea data showed, below a 1.3 percent rise in February. This was faster than a 0.8 percent rise in January this year.
The result lagged a median forecast of 1.3 percent in a Reuters poll, but analysts said falling inflation was likely to be shrugged off by the Bank of Korea when it next reviews policy on April 19.
""In annual terms, oil kept falling so this was expected. In the first half of this year, the central bank is likely to focus more on economic growth and exchange rates compared to inflation,"" said Chae Hyun-kee, an economist at KTB Securities in Seoul.
""Oil prices will continue affecting inflation through the second quarter.""
Month-on-month, the index in March fell 0.3 percent from February, compared with the forecast for no change in the Reuters poll.
Because of the fall in oil prices, inflation for industrial products declined 0.9 percent, the only fall among the sub-indices. In a sign that consumption may be steadily recovering, service prices rose 2.3 percent in March from a year ago, nearly steady from a 2.4 percent gain in February.
Headline inflation has been ticking up shakily from the beginning of the year after it was stuck below one percent through nearly all of last year due to low commodity prices.
It still remains below the central bank's three-year inflation target of 2 percent, giving the bank some room to ease if needed.
Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said earlier this week that although inflation was expected to remain low for a while, it was likely to start picking up in the second half of the year as the effects of low oil prices subsided.

Annual core inflation, which strips out the volatile prices of agricultural and oil products, was 1.7 percent in March from a year ago, compared to 1.8 percent in February.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's next government seems certain to be hamstrung by tough spending restrictions after the country missed its 2015 public deficit target by almost a full percentage point, far more than expected.
Months of fruitless coalition talks following inconclusive national elections in December have left it in political limbo, and on Thursday public finances also took a turn for the worse.
The deficit reached 5.16 percent of economic output, the acting treasury ministry said, well beyond the 4.2 percent target agreed with the European Commission and the 4.8 percent Brussels had forecast. 
Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said in a statement the data confirmed the EU executive's concerns about Spain's finances, which it would assess fully in May. 
Spain's acting government is hoping to persuade Brussels it can get close to the 2016 deficit target of 2.8 percent via stricter controls on regional finances and by leveraging a strong economic recovery.
Acting Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters in Paris that 2016's budget, passed last year by the center-right People's Party (PP), would not otherwise need amending. 
But to hit the target, the next administration will have to find savings of around 25 billion euros this year, according to Reuters calculations, possibly in the form of unpopular tax hikes or social spending cuts.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note it expected Spain's 2016 deficit to reach 3.8 percent, again one point wider than targeted.
""Whoever leads the next government will have to deal with the inescapable reality of further fiscal consolidation,"" added Antonio Barroso, economist at Teneo Intelligence. 
""The Commission will probably be much more aggressive once a new administration is in place.""
The unpromising state of coalition negotiations suggests that seems unlikely before a second national election takes place, probably in June.

The 2015 miss also makes it harder for Spain to get leeway on the tough 2016 goal -- a stance advocated by parties currently in talks over forming a government including the Socialists, leftist Podemos (""We Can"") and centrist Ciudadanos (""Citizens"").
Caretaker Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy signaled in February he was also open to asking Europe for flexibility on the deficit target, and de Guindos did not rule out such a move on Thursday, saying the deficit miss opened up a period of discussion with the Commission. 
""It's bad news,"" said Daniel Fuentes, economist at think tank AFI. ""They'll get to Brussels... facing questions on whether they're making enough of an effort."" 
The miss is a blow for the acting PP government, perceived as the party with the firmest grasp on the economy, which assured voters in the run-up to the election Spain would come close to hitting the target.
Government finances were pushed over the limit by over-spending by regional governments, especially the eastern regions of Catalonia and Valencia, and one-off costs such as a national health bill to treat hepatitis C patients, Acting Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro told a news conference.
Spain has whittled down the deficit since a financial crisis, after the PP wielded deep spending cuts. But the PP also brought in tax cuts before the election, and the government failed to keep within yearly limits established by Brussels throughout its term. 

Including international financial aid from a 2012 banking bailout, the 2015 deficit came to 5.24 percent, confirming data from the National Statistics Institute.

The increase in the business barometer was led by a very sharp rise in production, which followed an even steeper decline in the previous month.
The biggest surprise came from the employment component which rose above the 50 mark in March and to the highest level since April 2015.
Both new orders and order backlogs also posted significant increases, with backlogs just short of moving into expansion for what would have been the first time since January 2015.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's current account deficit has surged to a record high, underscoring a weak spot in an economy that is coming under sharper focus before a vote on whether to remain in the European Union.
While official data also showed the economy grew slightly faster than previously thought, campaigners on both sides of the EU debate seized on the much bigger than expected gap in the balance of payments to push their views.
Finance minister George Osborne said the widening of the deficit to a record 7.0 percent of gross domestic product - up from 4.3 percent of GDP in the third quarter - underscored the importance of Britain voting to remain in the EU on June 23.
""Today's figures expose the real danger of economic uncertainty and shows that now is precisely not the time to put our economic security at risk by leaving the EU,"" Osborne said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said a vote to leave the bloc would test the ""kindness of strangers"" who cover Britain's balance of payments shortfall. Sterling has weakened sharply this year on concerns about the referendum.
But campaigners for Brexit, as leaving the EU is called, said Thursday's data showed Britain would flourish on its own because it would no longer have to fund the EU's budget and the scale of its trade gap - a big part of the current account deficit - meant other EU countries would be keen to do a deal to keep their exports flowing.
""These figures blow a hole in the remain campaign's key tactic: to do down Britain and wrongly suggest that we can't get a free trade deal after we say no to Brussels,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave campaign group, said.
Most economists say Britain's economy would suffer at least a short-term hit to growth if voters decided to leave the EU, and that uncertainty over the referendum will affect the confidence of consumers and businesses before June.
A survey published on Thursday showed a measure of consumer confidence remained stuck at its lowest level in more than a year, hurt by worries about the EU referendum and the euro zone's persistent economic problems.
For 2015 as a whole, the current account deficit hit a record 5.2 percent of GDP.
The Office for National Statistics' figures showed a fall in income from British direct investments abroad in the fourth quarter while more money flowed out to foreign investors in Britain, a reflection of Britain's stronger economic growth.
Britain's economy grew by a quarterly 0.6 percent in the October-December period, higher than a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, helped by the huge services sector. Growth in 2015 as a whole was revised up slightly to 2.3 percent, faster than most of the world's other rich countries.
Consumer demand remains the main driver of growth and spending by households kept up its pace in the fourth quarter.
BoE data showed growth in consumer lending over the 12 months to February was its strongest since 2005.

However, real household disposable income fell 0.6 percent as rises in incomes failed to keep up with a pickup in prices and the ratio of savings fell to a record low, the ONS said.

The output of service-producing industries rose 0.4%, a fourth consecutive monthly gain.

Market research firm GfK said its overall consumer sentiment indicator stood at zero in March, unchanged from February and its joint lowest level since December 2014.
Britain's consumers have been the driver of the country's economic recovery over the past three years.
""Despite good economic headlines about low inflation, interest rates and prices in the shops, concerns about Brexit and the ongoing euro zone crisis appear to be hitting home,"" Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
Optimism among consumers about the economy over the next 12 months was 18 points lower than in March 2015 at -12.
Britain's finance minister George Osborne has warned repeatedly that the country faces a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from the world economy.
Economists say the government's decision to hold the EU referendum is another, home-grown, risk which is likely to hurt confidence in the run-up to the vote on June 23. If voters decide to leave the bloc, Britain will probably suffer a hit to growth, at least in the short term, most economists say.
The GfK survey showed consumers were less willing to spend on big-ticket items than in February.

GfK carried out the survey of 2,002 people between March 1 and March 16 on behalf of the European Commission.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output in February fell the most since 2011 when a devastating earthquake ruptured the supply chain, stoking fears of another recession and renewing pressure on policymakers to take evasive action.
The data followed passage of the fiscal 2016 budget on Tuesday, paving the way for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce a new fiscal stimulus or drop the planned 2017 hike in sales tax after first quarter economic growth data due on May 18 is published.
The announcement may also be made around when Abe hosts a summit of the Group of Seven richest nations from May 26 to May 27.
Analysts expect GDP to resume moderate growth in January to March although some fear a second straight quarter of contraction - the definition of a technical recession - because of weak exports and tepid consumption.
""It's fully possible Japan may suffer a second straight quarter of contraction,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
With inflation stalling, consumer spending weakening and China's slowdown threatening to undermine the export-reliant economy, the Bank of Japan is also under pressure to act again after it unexpectedly adopted negative rates less than two months ago.
As speculation lingers that Abe may call a snap election for parliament's lower house to coincide with a July poll for the upper chamber, analysts bet Abe will adopt fresh stimulus targeting consumers and again delay raising the sales tax.
But some are sceptical about sustainability of such stimulus. ""It may support the economy near-term but they won't be a fundamental solution. Structural reform such as immigration policy to secure the labour force is needed to fix Japan's rock-bottom growth potential,"" said BNP Paribas' Shiraishi.
Trade ministry data showed industrial output fell 6.2 percent month-on-month in February, largely in line with economists' median estimate. It followed a 3.7 percent rise in the prior month, which was the first gain in three months.
It was the biggest drop since March 2011, when the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan's northeastern coastal areas.
The decline was exaggerated by one-off factors caused by the Lunar New Year holidays in China and Asia generally - Japan's key export markets - and Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) halting of factory production for a week following an explosion at a steel plant.
Excluding such factors, analysts see factory output remaining flat as a trend due to weakness in external and domestic demand, dragged by sluggish sales of smartphones and tame capital expenditure at home, in China and in Asia generally.
""Industrial output probably declined in the first quarter. I expect the economy to have barely grown even with the extra Leap Year day pushing up consumption in February,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's consumer spending in February rose for the first time in six months, official data showed on Tuesday, but the rise was partly because of the extra Leap Year day and did little to reduce pressure on the government to inject more economic stimulus.
The propensity to consume - a measure of households' willingness to spend rather than save - rose 3.9 points in February, the biggest gain in nine months.
Spending also rose because consumers bought mobile phone plans before government regulations stopped carriers from subsidising the entire cost of handsets, economists said.
""This is not the kind of spending you see when wages are improving,"" said Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities.
""I am worried consumption could pull back in March because the data in February were driven by temporary factors.""
Cigarette sales also rose before a price hike in April.
Labour demand remained at the highest in two decades but the jobless rate rose slightly in February, in a tentative sign of a pause in recent improvements in the labour market.
Worries about risks posed by weak emerging market economies are likely to fuel speculation that Japan's government will launch a new round of stimulus spending and delay a sales tax increase scheduled for next year.
""I expect consumer spending to rise further, but the gains will be very moderate given low demand for durable goods,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""It would still make sense for the government to consider some form of stimulus, because it may want to act in response to concerns that the global economy is slowing.""
Household spending rose 1.2 percent in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday.
That compared with the median forecast for a 1.5 percent annual decline.
Domestic consumption has mostly struggled since the government raised the sales tax in 2014.
A second sales tax hike is due in 2017, which is part of a two-step plan to raise more money for healthcare spending. Advisers close to the prime minister are calling for next year's tax hike to be shelved.

The unemployment rate rose in February to 3.3 percent, from 3.2 percent in the previous month, and the jobs-applicants ratio held steady at a 24-year high of 1.28 in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February and inflation retreated, suggesting the Federal Reserve could remain cautious about raising interest rates this year even as the labor market rapidly tightens. 
Monday's report from the Commerce Department also showed consumer spending in January was not as strong as previously reported. That, together with other data showing a widening in the goods trade deficit in February, indicated economic growth remained sluggish in the first quarter.
""It speaks to the weakening in domestic economic momentum at the start of this year, further reinforcing the Fed's cautious monetary policy bias,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent as households cut back on goods purchases after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent in January.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending for January was revised down to show it unchanged rather than the 0.4 percent rise that was previously reported.
Given labor market strength and cheap gasoline, economists speculated that consumption had been hampered by a massive stock market sell-off at the start of the year which eroded consumer confidence.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the advance goods trade deficit widened to $62.9 billion in February from $62.2 billion, rising for a fourth straight month as an increase in exports was offset by a gain in imports. 
The government will publish February's trade data, which includes services, on April 5. 
In the wake of the consumer spending and trade data, economists slashed their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 0.9 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose marginally. U.S. stocks were little changed.
INFLATION EASES
Inflation moderated last month, with a price index for consumer spending dipping 0.1 percent after nudging up 0.1 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 1.0 percent after rising 1.2 percent in January.
Excluding food and energy, prices gained 0.1 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.7 percent after a similar increase in January.
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. The slowdown in the monthly core PCE reading came after Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently expressed skepticism over the sustainability of the gains in core inflation measures. 
Yellen told reporters this month ""there may be some transitory factors"" behind the run-up in prices. Still, the annual core PCE rate held above the level that central bank policymakers expected it to be by the end of this year.
""While the data from January and February may overstate any underlying firming, we do think that the trend in core inflation is picking up,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The still-soft inflation suggests the U.S. central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates this year. New Fed projections published this month showed policymakers expect two quarter-point rate hikes by year-end, half the number seen in December.
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Consumer spending last month was held back by a 0.7 percent drop in purchases of goods. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent.
Personal income rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in January. The slowdown in income growth is likely temporary amid anecdotal evidence that the tightening jobs market, marked by an unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent and growing skills shortages, is driving up wages. 
Households boosted savings to a more than three-year high last month. Higher savings and a firming housing market, which is bolstering household net worth, should support consumer spending this year.
In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said contracts to buy previously owned homes increased 3.5 percent in February to a seven-month high.

""As long as income growth remains steady, expect consumers to loosen their purse strings in the coming months,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.

Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in January and February combined rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, totaling 780.7 billion yuan ($119.8 billion) in the two-month period, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Sunday.
That compared with an annual fall of 4.7 percent in December 2015, which was the seventh straight month of decline.
""The recovery in property investment has helped industrial profits return to positive growth,"" Zhang Wenlang, an analyst at CITIC Securities, wrote in a note on Monday.
""Looking forward, industrial profits are likely to grow this year thanks to improved household consumption, a recovery in property investment and a halt in the slump in commodity prices.""
China's real estate investment rose 3 percent in the first two months of 2016 in year-on-year terms, quickening from an increase of 1 percent in the full year of 2015.
The positive trend was also driven by quicker product sales of industrial firms and a slower decline in industrial producer prices, NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.
The oil processing, electrical machinery and food sectors contributed significantly to the growth in profits, He added, saying the sectors benefited from lower oil prices.
Growth in the food industry was driven by strong demand as well as a decline in prices for some raw materials, the statement added.
The NBS combines profits for the first two months of each year to smooth out seasonal distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, when most companies are closed for the long celebrations.
China's producer prices fell for the 48th month in a row in February though their pace of decline eased, highlighting the persistent pressure on manufacturers.
China's Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that the country has enough policy tools to keep the economy stable despite ""deep rooted"" structural problems and downward pressure.

Chinese leaders have set an economic growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for this year, introducing a range rather than a more precise target as it seeks greater flexibility in juggling growth, job creation and restructuring of a host of ""zombie companies"" in bloated industries.

The quarterly survey of over 2,200 firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) also showed less hiring by companies, marking the second consecutive quarter of downward pressure on employment as executives scale back borrowing and spending.
Only 33 percent of firms reported capital expenditure growth in the first quarter, the lowest in the survey's five-year history.
The share of firms reporting capex growth has fallen by over 40 percent since the second quarter of 2014.
However, profits in the first quarter improved from the previous quarter's lows as revenue growth steadied, the survey showed.
""It's unclear whether the economy as a whole weakened again in the first quarter. But policy challenges appear to have grown, and Beijing therefore may perceive the economy as weaker,"" survey report authors Leland Miller and Shehzad Qazi wrote.
Economists have questioned China's official statistics for years and turn to private surveys such as the CBB and measures such as concrete, steel or electricity production to better gauge changes in the world's second-largest economy.
Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli told a high-level economic forum last week that recent data through early March showed that the economy is improving.
The latest reported data showed factory output in January and February grew at its weakest pace since 2008, while exports and imports continued to shrink, although fixed-asset investment growth beat expectations due to quickening property investment.
The survey showed just 23 percent of firms expanded their workforces in the first quarter, falling to half of what CCB reported in its inaugural report back in 2012.
""Less borrowing and spending was necessary after the 2009-10 excesses. Less hiring is a much more pointed problem,"" it said.
The survey's findings of growing strains on corporate China echo those of a Reuters analysis last week, which showed Chinese companies are facing their tightest liquidity crunch in a decade as customers take longer to pay their bills, forcing some into more costly and less secure borrowing to stay afloat.
Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that China's employment was stable in the first two months of 2016, with a survey-based jobless rate at about 5.1 percent, though the real jobless rate is widely believed to be much higher.
The government has set a growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for 2016, after the economy expanded 6.9 percent in 2015 - the slowest pace in 25 years.
Beijing has pledged to make monetary policy more flexible this year even as it leans more on increased fiscal spending and tax cuts to support economic growth and cushion the pain from structural reforms.

Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in January and February combined rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, totaling 780.7 billion yuan ($119.8 billion) in the two-month period, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Sunday.
That compared with an annual fall of 4.7 percent in December 2015, which was the seventh straight month of decline.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2016 11:30AM ET</span>","Consumers prop up U.S. economy, but profits under pressure","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as previously estimated, with fairly strong consumer spending offsetting the drag from efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its third GDP estimate.
Relatively strong consumer spending underscores the economy's underlying strength and should further allay fears of a recession, which triggered a massive stock market sell-off early this year. That, together with a tightening labor market and rising inflation likely keeps the Federal Reserve on a path to gradually raise interest rates this year.
""The consumer is back in the driver's seat. There is no sign of recession in these data so this will put a smile on Fed officials' faces and argues for their policy of gradual interest rate normalization to continue,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
GDP growth was initially estimated to have risen at only a 0.7 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent for all of 2015. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.4 percent pace and not the 2.0 percent rate reported last month. More consumption of services than previously estimated accounted for the revision. 
Spending is being supported by rising wages as the jobs markets tightens, as well as firming house prices. Gasoline prices around $2 per gallon are also helping to underpin household discretionary spending.
The dollar was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies. The U.S. stock and Treasury debt markets were closed for Good Friday. 
PROFITS SINK 
Fourth-quarter inventory investment was revised lower. Still, inventories remain high relative to domestic demand.
Businesses accumulated $78.3 billion worth of inventory rather than the $81.7 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.14 percentage point. First-quarter GDP growth estimates are around a 1.5percent rate. But with the inventory pile still large and shipments of capital goods ordered by businesses weak in January and February, the risks to growth are tilted to the downside. 
There was some bad news in the GDP report, with corporate profits falling for a second straight quarter as a strong dollar and cheap oil undercut the earnings of multinational and energy companies.
Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments declined at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2014, after falling at a 1.7 percent pace in the third quarter. 
For all of 2015 profits dropped 5.1 percent, the largest decline since 2008, after slipping 0.6 percent in 2014.
Profits from current production fell $159.6 billion after decreasing $33.0 billion in the third quarter. Part of the drop was due to a $20.8 billion transfer payment related to the  BP  (L:BP) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which was the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill. 
But even accounting for the oil spill settlement, which translated to an $83.2 billion rate of decline in profits, earnings were still weak. Profits from the rest of the world fell $6.5 billion after decreasing $23.1 billion in the third quarter. 
Manufacturing profits tumbled $139.2 billion during the last quarter after falling by only $4.1 billion in the July-September period. Profits in the petroleum and coal products sector plunged $124.3 billion after rising $7.0 billion in the third quarter. 
""This poor performance reflects energy firms struggling with lower oil prices and manufacturing firms hit by the strong dollar,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But it also likely reflects the beginnings of a profit margin squeeze driven by tighter labor markets, rising wages, and weak productivity growth.""
The dollar gained 10.5 percent last year versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, putting a squeeze on the profits of multinationals such as Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL). 

A more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices from highs above $100 a barrel in June 2014 has also weighed on the profits of oilfield service firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence probably deteriorated to the lowest in nearly three years and it is expected to worsen in the coming quarter due to exporters concern over a strong yen and worries over the global economy, a Reuters poll showed.
Big firms are likely slash their capital spending plan for the new fiscal year beginning in April, according to the survey.
Firms tend to be cautious in their spending plans at this time of year, but concern over the outlook for profits makes it unlikely that they will become more ambitious in their capital expenditure budgets later in the year, analysts said.
Date due for release next week includes industrial production, which likely declined for the first time in two months in February due to weak demand in Japan and overseas.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey was expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment slipped by 4 points to plus 8 points from plus 12 points three months ago, the poll of 23 economists showed.
It would be the lowest reading since the June 2013 survey when big manufacturers' mood stood at plus 4 points.
""Worsening sentiment among big manufacturers likely became apparent due to the economic slowdown overseas and the yen's sharp appreciation,"" Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute said in the survey.
""Domestic consumer spending in the doldrums is depressing the mood among non-manufacturers, but strong demand from foreign visitors and the benefits of the BOJ's negative interest rate on the real estate industry will probably moderate that pressure to some degree.""
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers was expected to slip to plus 24 from plus 25 three months ago, worsening for the first time since the September 2014 survey.
The poll also showed the sentiment of both manufacturers' and non-manufacturers will worsen in the coming three months due to uncertainty over the market outlook and the state of emerging economies, as well as sluggish wage recovery.
Big firms were forecast to slash their capital spending plan by 0.7 percent for the coming fiscal year, according to the poll.
The BOJ will released the tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. on April 1 (2350 GMT March 31).
Earlier this week, the Reuters Tankan monthly survey, which shows a close correlation with the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey, showed Japanese manufacturers' confidence waned in March and was unlikely to change much over the next three months.
The poll also found industrial production, which will be released on Wednesday, likely fell 6.0 percent in February from the previous month after it increased 3.7 percent in January.
Retail sales were seen rising 1.7 percent in February from a year earlier after a revised 0.2 percent slip in January.
Household spending was likely down 1.5 percent in February, falling for a sixth straight month.
The jobs-applicants ratio probably improved further at 1.29 in February, its highest since December 1991, and the jobless rate was probably steady at 3.2 percent last month, the poll showed.
The internal affairs ministry will release household spending and jobs related data at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday and the trade ministry will announce retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on the same day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell in February as the sector continued to struggle with the lingering effects of a robust dollar and lower oil prices.
While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, revisions to the prior weeks' figures showed the labor market was much stronger than previously thought.
The resilience of the labor market has helped calm fears the economy was heading into a recession, and the combination of tightening labor market conditions and firming inflation likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to steadily raise interest rates this year. 
""The economy continues to hold its own despite a slowdown in many other countries around the world. The Fed can continue with its policy of gradual rate hikes,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, declined 2.8 percent last month after increasing 4.2 percent in January. Durable goods orders have decreased in three of the last four months. 
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 1.8 percent after advancing by a downwardly revised 3.1 percent in January. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 3.4 percent in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders falling 2.9 percent last month and orders for core capital goods slipping 0.1 percent.
U.S. stocks fell on the data and weaker oil prices. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said another U.S. interest rate ""may not be far off."" Prices for U.S. Treasuries were mixed.
The U.S. central bank increased its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
SOLID LABOR MARKET
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended March 19. 
The government also revised data going back to 2011, which showed claims generally trending lower than previously reported. Claims for the week ended March 5 were the lowest since November 1973. The low level of claims has economists anticipating another month of strong job gains in March after nonfarm payrolls increased by 242,000 in February.
""The U.S. jobs market remains solid. With a tighter jobs market, more people are looking for work and employers are raising wages, both good news for consumer spending and the overall economy in 2016,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh.
Strong domestic demand is helping to offset some of the drag on manufacturing from weak global consumption. Despite February's drop in durable goods orders, there are signs the downward spiral in manufacturing is drawing to an end.
Several reports in recent days have shown a pick-up in regional factory activity in March, leading to optimism that a broader manufacturing survey will show the sector expanded this month for the first time since September.
""We are putting a low weight on this (durable goods orders)report in judging the short-term state of manufacturing activity,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hammered by the buoyant dollar, weak global demand and capital spending cuts by oilfield service firms like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL). 
Efforts by businesses to sell unwanted inventory have also meant fewer orders placed, adding to pressure on factories. But the dollar's gains versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners (DXY) have slowed since the start of the year and the oil price slide has become less pronounced.
The drop in durable goods orders last month was broad-based. 
Shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report â fell 1.1 percent last month after sliding 1.3 percent in January. 
The February shipments drop led economists to cut their first-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 1.4 percent annualized rate.
The economy grew at a 1.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter, according to data released last month. The Commerce Department is due on Friday to release its final fourth-quarter GDP estimate. 

""GDP growth will not be getting much help from business spending in the near future,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The drop in durable goods orders last month was led by a 27.1 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders, which contributed to a 6.2 percent drop in bookings for transportation equipment.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received orders for only two aircraft last month, down from 68 planes in January.
Orders for primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and electronic products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components also fell.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 1.2 percent. 
Shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report â fell 1.1 percent last month after sliding 1.3 percent in January. 
The drop in shipments in February could prompt economists to trim first-quarter GDP growth estimates, which are currently around a 2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in January. Durable goods inventories fell 0.3 percent and have been down in seven of the last eight months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales rebounded modestly in February as a surge in the West offset sharp declines in other regions, pointing to a gradually improving housing sector amid a dearth of properties available on the market.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday home sales rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512,000 units. January's sales pace was revised up to 502,000 units from the previously reported 494,000 units.
""The housing market is improving, though in fits and starts and not uniformly across the nation,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
New single-family home sales were driven by a 38.5 percent jump in the West last month, which reversed January's 32.7 percent dive. Sales plunged 24.2 percent in the Northeast and tumbled 17.9 percent in the Midwest. They fell 4.1 percent in the populous South.
Excluding the West, home sales were down 8.1 percent. New home sales account for about 9.2 percent of the housing market.
The report came on the heels of data on Monday showing a 7.1 percent drop in sales of previously owned homes in February, which was blamed on tight inventories, bad weather and difficulties adjusting the data during the month with a leap day.
The S&P homebuilding index was down 0.88 percent, in line with a broadly weaker U.S. stock market.
Shares in D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder, fell 1.4 percent and rival  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.8 percent.
DECENT SPRING SELLING SEASON
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a dip in home buying activity last week, with its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index falling 1.0 percent from a week earlier. The index, however, increased 25 percent from a year ago.
While economists and realtors expect a fairly busy spring selling season, they caution that the persistent shortage of homes on the market, which is limiting options for buyers and pushing up prices, was a challenge.
""Existing and new home prices are rising quickly and that's really taking a bite out of housing affordability. New and existing home inventories are very lean, that can hurt sales,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
""Spring sales should be decent, but won't be as good as they could have been if there was more inventory on the market and affordability was a little bit stronger.""
There were 1.88 million existing homes available for sale in February, up 3.3 percent from January, but 1.1 percent lower than a year ago. House prices have been rising by more than 5 percent, outpacing wage growth.
While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.7 percent in February to the highest level since October 2009, it remained less than half of what it was at the height of the housing bubble.
At February's sales pace it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from January.
With the strengthening labor market boosting household formation and mortgage rates still low by historical standards, housing fundamentals remain solid. The sector should continue to contribute to economic growth this year.

""We expect the housing market to continue to be a moderate but unremarkable contributor to growth for the remainder of 2016,"" said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, and economic analyst at FTN Financial in New York.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2016 08:44PM ET</span>","Japan manufacturers' mood weighed by yen gains, emerging market slowdown: Reuters Tankan","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers eased in March and is seen unlikely to change much over the next three months, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, in a sign that yen gains and slowing growth in China and emerging markets are hurting exporters. 
Service-sector sentiment bounced from the prior month's drop, but it is seen down again in June, underscoring the fragility in private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy.
The monthly poll, which closely tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, suggests the BOJ poll may show worsening of the big manufacturers' sentiment index, as the economy faces the risk of another recession.
The poll of 513 big and mid-sized Japanese companies between March 3-17, of which 259 responded, came a week after the BOJ downgraded its economic view because of sluggish exports and factory output. The central bank stood pat at last week's policy review, after adopting a negative interest rate policy in January.
""Weak external demand is the major culprit for deterioration in manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""The BOJ tankan will probably show worsening of sentiment at manufacturers and non-manufacturers. We expect the BOJ will ease again in July when it is likely to cut economic and price outlooks. A surprise action cannot be ruled out in April though.""
The upcoming BOJ tankan on April 1 is among key indicators the central bank scrutinises when making monetary policy. Expectations linger that it could ease again in coming months to hit its ambitious 2 percent price target.
""Some of our clients are taking a wait-and-see stance due to yen's rise, stock falls and negative interest rates. While the government's preferential measures for investment end in March, construction is lagging due to labour shortages,"" a machinery producer said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
Many manufacturers complained about the slowdown in China and emerging markets, and rises in the yen, which hit a 17-month high below 111 versus the dollar this month.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 6 in March from 7 in February, weighed by chemicals, metal products and precision machinery. It is seen at 7 in June.
Compared with three months ago, the manufacturers' index worsened by three points, suggesting the BOJ's tankan may show a deterioration in the big manufacturers' sentiment.

The service-sector index rose to 24 from 21 in February, led by retailers and information/communications. The index is seen worsening again in the next three months.

The ONS noted that the contributions to change in the CPI rate from the detailed categories were relatively small compared with most months, while the largest downward contribution came from the transport sector, from price changes for items such as road passenger transport, second-hand cars and bicycles.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation edged up 0.2% in February, below forecasts for an advance of 0.4% and following a decline of 0.8% in the prior month.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone businesses end first quarter on a higher note: PMIs,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON(Reuters) - Euro zone business activity ended the first quarter on a higher note, surveys showed on Tuesday, suggesting extra stimulus from the European Central
Bank may already be having a positive effect.
The ECB chopped interest rates again and bolstered its asset purchase program earlier this month as part of an ongoing battle to drive up growth and inflation in the 19-nation bloc.
""There are some signs that perhaps the stimulus is being perceived by companies as a springboard for better growth coming up in the rest of the year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) <EUPMCF=ECI>, regarded as a good growth indicator, jumped to 53.7 this month from February's 53.0, which was the lowest reading since the start of 2015.
The latest result was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which had a median prediction of 53.0. Any reading above 50 denotes growth.
Williamson said the PMI pointed to first quarter GDP growth of 0.3 percent, slightly weaker than a Reuters poll prediction earlier this month of 0.4 percent. [ECILT/EU]
However, as they have for all but two months in the last four years, firms cut prices to stimulate trade and the output price index only nudged up to 48.6 from 48.5.
Euro zone inflation was -0.2 percent in February, nowhere near the ECB's close-to-2-percent target.
The PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry also came in above expectations for no change from February's 13-month low of 53.3. It jumped to 54.0, matching the most optimistic forecast in a Reuters poll.
But some of the activity was driven by the running down of old orders. A backlogs of work index slipped below 50 for the first time since May, dipping to 49.8 from last month's break-even point.

Manufacturers also had a better than expected month. Their PMI rose to 51.4 from February's one-year low of 51.2, just pipping the 51.3 median forecast. An output index, which feeds into the composite PMI, climbed to 52.7 from 52.3.
Suggesting April may see little improvement, factories barely increased headcount this month. The employment sub-index fell to 50.5 from 51.0, its lowest reading since late-2014.
""There is an underbelly of weakness still prevalent in the economy but hopefully the ECB's extra stimulus should mean that things turn around pretty quickly,"" Williamson said."

In a report, market research group Markit said that its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose from 53.0 in February to 53.7 in March, above forecasts for 53.0.
The flash services purchasing managersâ index improved to 54.0 this month from 53.3 in February, beating expectations for a reading of 53.3.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managersâ index inched up to a seasonally adjusted 51.4 this month from a final reading of 51.2 in February. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 51.3 in March.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The upturn in March was led by services, where business activity growth revived from Februaryâs 13-month nadir to reach a three-month high, aided by a marginal uplift in new business growth.
Manufacturing once again lagged behind services, but also saw growth of output and new orders accelerate slightly, improving on the 12-and ten-month respective lows seen in February.
Prices meanwhile continued to fall. Average input costs dropped slightly for a third successive month, helping drive down average prices charged by firms for their goods and services at the second-fastest rate seen for just over a year.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, âThe euro zone saw renewed signs of life at the start of spring. The March PMI showed a welcome end to the worrying slowdown trend seen in the first two months of the year, putting the region on course for a 0.3% expansion of GDP in the first quarter.â
âPlenty of worrying signs persist, however, to take the shine off the rise in the headline PMI. Deflationary pressures also remain stubbornly widespread as a lack of demand led to further discounting in March,â he added.
EUR/USD was at 1.1200 from around 1.1195 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.7848 from 0.7850 earlier.

The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis from a final 50.1 in February.
It fell below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since April last year.
The sub-index for new export orders fell to a preliminary 45.9 from 49.0 in February, which would indicate the sharpest contraction since January 2013 if confirmed by the final report.
Japan's exports fell for a fifth straight month in February, separate data from the finance ministry showed last week.
Some economists say Japan's exports could remain weak for some time as a slowdown in China and other emerging markets weighs on demand for Japanese machinery and electronics.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, shrank in the final quarter of 2015 as slow wage growth and sluggish global demand hurt consumption and exports.
While many analysts expect growth to have rebounded modestly in the current quarter, concern about global demand has led some to predict another contraction that will push Japan back into recession - defined as two straight quarters of economic contraction.

The Bank of Japan stunned global markets in January by adding negative interest rates to its massive asset-buying program as it struggles to reflate the long-moribund economy.

The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales dropped 7.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.08 million units, the lowest level since November.
Sales have been volatile and prone to big swings up and down in recent months following the introduction in October of new mortgage regulations, which are intended to help homebuyers understand their loan options and shop around for loans best suited to their financial circumstances.
February's decline weighed on investor sentiment, with the S&P 500 stock index falling after the data was released. 
Sales fell across the country, including a 17.1 percent plunge in the U.S. Northeast.
Economists had forecast home resales decreasing 2.8 percent to a pace of 5.32 million units last month. Sales were up 2.2 percent from a year ago.
The median price for a previously owned home increased 4.4 percent from a year ago to $210,800. 
The housing report runs counter to data showing strong job growth and a stabilization of factory output, which had taken a hit from weaker demand overseas and a strong U.S. dollar.
Housing continues to be supported by a tightening labor market, which is starting to push up wage growth, boosting household formation. But a relative dearth of properties available for sale remains a challenge.
""Finding the right property at an affordable price is burdening many potential buyers,"" said NAR economist Lawrence Yun.
In February, the number of unsold homes on the market rose 3.3 percent from January to 1.88 million units, but was down 1.1 percent from a year ago. 

At February's sales pace, it would take 4.4 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.0 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2016 02:15AM ET</span>","China home prices rise most in nearly 2 years, big cities fuel bubble worries","By Xiaoyi Shao and Clare Jim
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices rose at their fastest clip in almost two years in February thanks to red-hot demand in big cities, but risks of overheating in some places combined with weak growth in smaller cities threaten to put more stress on an already slowing economy. 
Average new home prices in 70 major cities climbed 3.6 percent in February from a year ago, quickening from January's 2.5 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) on Friday.
That was the quickest year-on-year increase since June 2014, and encouragingly, 32 of 70 major cities tracked by the NBS saw annual price gains, up from 25 in January. 
Ordinarily, that should be welcome news for policymakers who have rolled out a raft of stimulus measures to support an economy growing at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. 
But the divergence in home prices - surging values in bigger cities and depressed markets in smaller cities plagued by a supply glut - makes Beijing's job harder as it looks to reanimate growth without inflating asset bubbles.
""The governmentâs all-out encouragement of housing sales seems to be working, but at the cost of surging prices in big cities,"" said Rosealea Yao, an economist at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.
""These surges in big cities are not sustainable and would increase uncertainties and instability in the overall housing market.""
The data showed tier 1 cities, including Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing, remained the top performers, with prices surging 56.9 percent, 20.6 percent and 12.9 percent respectively.
SMALLER CITIES, BIGGER HEADACHES
""Prices in first-tier cities are very expensive now, itâs hard for new families to afford a home,"" said Tan Huajie, vice president China's biggest property firm Vanke (HK:2202).
The trouble is that speculators and ordinary investors, who have been shaken by the summer crash in mainland stock markets, are increasingly ploughing their money into the housing market - most of it going to the frothy sector in big centers. 
A slowing economy has also meant most jobs are in the biggest cities, drawing more people into these places and feeding the insatiable demand for homes. 
A breakdown of NBS data showed that a slew of government measures and increased lending has failed to arrest persistent softness in property markets in smaller cities where a glut of unsold houses have weighed on prices. 
Most third-tier cities still saw on-year prices drops in February, though the declines eased from the previous month.
POLICY CHALLENGE
With the broader economy decelerating amid weak exports, factory overcapacity, slowing investment and high debt levels, authorities are hoping the property market will help stabilize growth.
But signs that some places may be overheating even as prices remain depressed in smaller cities complicate matters for policymakers.
While fears of a hardlanding for China's economy have abated in recent weeks, Beijing cannot afford a housing market crash in the big cities given the real estate industry and related investment activities account for 15 percent of gross domestic product.
Underscoring the importance of the sector to the $10 trillion economy, Friday's home data helped fuel strong gains in steel and iron ore futures in Shanghai. [IRONORE/]
Senior Chinese officials raised alarm over the country's overheated housing market during an annual parliament meeting this week.
In an effort to deter speculation, some officials have suggested the release of more public land for sale in areas with the hottest price rises, while others have vowed to crack down on players illegally lending home-buyers to make downpayments.
China's housing Minister Chen Zhenggao acknowledged on Tuesday that price divergence in China's big and small cities poses a challenge for housing market policy controls.
""Now one important task for us is to stabilize home prices in tier 1 cities and some tier 2 cities,"" said Chen.

1351,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 09:14PM ET</span>",Bank of Japan minutes show sharp debate on negative rates,"Investing.com - The Bank of Japan board had a sharp debate on whether to follow some European central banks and add negative interest rates to its aggressive monetary easing program, leading to a tight 5 to 4 vote on adopting the new policy, the minutes of the bank's Jan. 28-29 meeting released Friday showed.
""Many members expressed the view that introduction of QQE (quantitative and qualitative easing) with a Negative Interest Rate was desirable to preempt manifestation of the risk that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected and to maintain momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2%,"" they said.
""On the other hand, some other members expressed the view that, although risks emanating from developments in global financial markets were tilted to the downside, Japan's economic activity and prices had not deteriorated to the extent where additional easing measures were necessary.""
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who chaired the board meeting, asked its staff to show possible policy options, the minutes said, adding those included an expansion of QQE that consisted of an acceleration in the paces of increase in the monetary base and in asset purchases; and introduction of QQE with a Negative Interest Rate.
At the January meeting, unstable global financial markets and depressed crude oil prices led the board to delay the estimated timing of achieving 2% inflation by six months for the third time in the past 10 months and adopt a potentially contradictory negative interest rate policy.
Four of the nine BOJ board members voted against the idea of charging 0.1% interest on a small portion of excess reserves parked by lenders at the central bank, questioning the stimulative effect of the new policy and warning against its side effects.
Board member Sayuri Shirai told the meeting that ""introducing a negative interest rate immediately after the introduction of supplementary measures for QQE (in December) might be misunderstood as reaching a limit to the bank's asset purchases.""
Takehiro Sato thought ""a negative interest rate should be introduced when the bank slows down the pace of increase in the monetary base"" while Takahide Kiuchi pointed that ""introduction of a negative interest rate, which would adversely affect smooth conduct of the bank's JGB purchases, would only be an appropriate policy measure in a crisis situation.""

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 12:17PM ET</span>","Bank of England keeps rates steady, says sterling hit by EU vote","LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England policymakers said sterling had been dealt a big hit by uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum on EU membership and that growth could slow, after voting unanimously to keep rates steady.
The central bank said the upcoming vote on June 23 could delay some spending decisions, though it said recent indicators suggested growth would keep the same momentum this quarter as it had at the end of last year.
The BoE reiterated that interest rates were more likely to rise than not over the next three years and that when they did the rise would be gradual, given likely headwinds.
After a rapid recovery in recent years, British growth slowed in the second half of last year and recent surveys show it had a rocky start to 2016, when the country will hold a referendum on its membership of the European Union.
""There appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum,"" policymakers said. ""That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling. It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term.""
BoE Governor Mark Carney, in a recent appearance before lawmakers, pointed to some benefits of Britain's EU membership, but said the BoE would not comment on the long-term implications of an exit.
Britain's economy has slowed, along with the rest of the world, and some policymakers worry they may struggle to fend off the latest global downturn after pumping trillions into the global financial system in recent years and given that interest rates in major economies are already so low.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said the United States continued to face risks from an uncertain global economy and appeared to sharply scale back its plans for interest rate rises this year.
The BoE said short-term market interest rates had fallen due to market worries about the world economy, and the perception that the lower bound for central banks' interest rates could be lower than previously thought.
These looser financial conditions globally could provide the UK economy with some support.
It was the second month in a row policymakers voted unanimously to keep rates at a record low 0.5 percent after Ian McCafferty, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, last month abandoned his rate hike vote citing a weaker outlook for wages.
The government on Wednesday sharply cut its growth forecasts for this year and next as it delivered its annual budget, after the central bank also revised down its growth estimates in the February inflation report.
The BoE expects the economy to grow 2.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year, more optimistic than the government's forecasts for 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent growth in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Financial markets had fully priced out the possibility of an interest rate hike this year prior to the BoE meeting and some are even betting the first move will be a cut.
Inflation and wage growth have been sluggish for months, but have recently showed signs of a pick-up. Annual inflation edged up to a one-month high in January and wages grew by more than expected that month.
But this rise could struggle to gain momentum against the weaker economic backdrop, with the government on Wednesday also cutting its inflation forecasts for 2015 and 2016.
The BoE said the near-term outlook for inflation had changed little since the February inflation report, but added that it remained watchful for signs that low inflation might be weighing on wages.
The BoE has said it has more ammunition to help the economy if it is needed, but Carney has ruled out following in the footsteps of his European and Japanese counterparts with negative interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose from a five-month low last week, but remained below a level associated with a strengthening labor market as the economy regains momentum after a slow fourth quarter.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region expanded in March for the first time in seven months, the latest sign of stability in the distressed manufacturing sector. 
In addition, job openings hit a six-month high in January and a gauge of future economic activity increased in February after two straight months of declines.
The data should further allay fears of a looming recession and could keep the Federal Reserve on course to gradually raise interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank held borrowing costs steady on Wednesday.
""The labor market is tight as a drum. If we continue to receive strong reports like this, then the Fed is going to have to put a June rate hike on the table,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended March 12, the Labor Department said. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 54 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 750 to 268,000 last week.
The claims data covered the survey period for March nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 5,250 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting further payrolls gains. The labor market added 242,000 jobs in February. 
The labor market's resilience was underscored by a second report from the Labor Department showing job openings increased by 260,000 to a six-month high of 5.5 million in January. While hiring fell in January, that was likely because employers are having trouble finding qualified workers for open positions.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters on Wednesday that ""the labor market continues to strengthen"" and that economic growth appeared to have picked up from the fourth quarter's ""modest"" pace. The economy grew at a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2015 and first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are around a 2 percent rate.
New projections from Fed officials showed they expected two quarter-point rate increases by the end of this year, half the number seen in December. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Thursday, while U.S. stocks were mixed. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
MANUFACTURING ON THE MEND
In a third report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region jumped to 12.4 this month, the first positive reading in seven months, from a reading of -2.8 in February. 
The survey's gauge of new orders surged 21 points to 15.7, with almost 37 percent of firms reporting an increase in new orders this month. The shipments index jumped 20 points to 22.1 and unfilled orders and delivery times also improved.
In addition, factories continued to report declining inventories, which bodes well for future production. But factory employment in the region remained weak.
The Philadelphia Fed survey added to a similar survey from the New York Fed and Wednesday's manufacturing production report for February in suggesting the slump in factory activity had probably run its course. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been slammed by dollar strength, lower oil prices and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.
""The improvement supports our view that we are moving past the weakest period for the manufacturing sector. It is likely that we are now past the biggest drags from the stronger dollar and inventory correction,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell 3.6 percent to $125.3 billion in the fourth quarter. 
The improvement, however, is unlikely to be sustained as the strong dollar continues to undercut exports of goods.
For 2015, the current account deficit totaled $484.1 billion, the largest since 2008. The fourth-quarter current account deficit represented 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.9 percent in the July-September quarter. 

""The outsized surge in the dollar and weakness in emerging market economies has prompted a pull-back in exports that has more than offset improvement in the petroleum balance,"" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank left interest rates unchanged at record lows, cut its economic outlook and forecast a deeper bout of deflation as cheaper oil and slowing global growth weigh on the economy. 
The Swiss National Bank now expects consumer prices to rise 0.1 percent in 2017, just within its target of above zero but less than 2 percent a year.
""The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly in recent months and the situation on international financial markets remains volatile,"" the SNB said in a statement.
""Around the world, manufacturing and trade remained sluggish, contributing to a further sharp fall in oil prices.""
In Thursday's quarterly policy assessment, the SNB kept its target range for three-month Libor in negative territory, between -1.25 and -0.25 percent, as economists polled by Reuters unanimously predicted.
It also maintained a charge on cash deposits of 0.75 percent and repeated its pledge to intervene in the currency market if necessary to weaken the ""significantly over-valued"" Swiss franc.
A muted response from the franc to the European Central Bank's decision to cut rates and expand asset purchases last week had lessened the SNB's need to act on rates.
""As long as the ECB doesn't cut interest rates further, I don't think the SNB will cut rates,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron. 
Currency markets shrugged off the rate decision. 
FURTHER MEASURES
A rate cut further into negative territory would have drawn more criticism from banks, insurers and pension funds, which have had to pay the deposit charge on some of their cash holdings.
The SNB is using negative rates, coupled with an unspecified amount of foreign currency purchases, to weaken the franc and protect exports to the euro zone, Switzerland's biggest trading partner.
The two-pillar approach has helped to weaken the franc against the euro (EURCHF=EBS) in recent months and take some of the shine off its safe-haven status. The franc trades at around 1.09 per euro just over a year after the SNB abruptly abandoned a floor of 1.20. 
Speaking to Swiss television, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan left the door open for further policy action if needed.
""We do not rule out further measures,"" Jordan told SRF. ""But for the moment, after a comprehensive analysis, we concluded that the current monetary policy is the right one and we want to keep to this monetary policy for the moment.""
The SNB trimmed its outlook for Swiss gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year to between 1 percent and 1.5 percent from around 1.5 percent in its December forecast. Its outlook for inflation this year is now -0.8 percent, down from -0.5 percent previously. 
The SNB had previously forecast 2017 inflation of 0.3 percent. For 2018, it expects inflation of 0.9 percent.

""The SNB was a bit too optimistic in December regarding inflation and GDP,"" said Botteron. ""But I don't think it's a signal for future monetary policy. The (growth revisions) will not have any impact on monetary policy.""

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit falling to $118.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2015, it totaled $484.1 billion, the largest since 2008.

The current account deficit has declined from a record high of 6.3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, as rising domestic oil production and lower international oil prices keep the import bill in check.
The dollar gained 20 percent versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015, undermining exports. Goods exports fell 3.4 percent to $366.7 billion in the fourth quarter.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 06:50AM ET</span>","Norway's central bank cuts key rate, as expected; sees further cut","By Camilla Knudsen
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's central bank cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.50 percent on Thursday, as expected, and said it may cut again in the autumn to fight an economic downturn prompted by a drop in oil prices.
Rates might be cut to zero to help sustain the economy, Norges Bank said, with negative rates considered only if the economy suffered a further shock.
A slump in crude oil prices has caused a slowdown in Norway's oil and gas industry, which generates a fifth of economic output. Fears are growing the downturn will spread to the rest of the economy.
Although oil prices (LCOc1) have rebounded around 45 percent from lows seen earlier in 2016, they are still down by about 65 percent from mid-2014. Energy companies operating off Norway are laying off tens of thousands of workers to preserve cash.
All 16 economists polled by Reuters had forecast the bank would cut its deposit rate from the current 0.75 percent.
""The current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the course of the year,"" Governor Oeystein Olsen said in a statement. He later told a news conference this was most likely in the autumn.
The bank also raised the possibility of negative rates, despite having previously cautioned that such a move might have limited effects.
That approach contrasts with the policies in neighboring Denmark and Sweden, which have both cut the cost of borrowing to negative levels.
""Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will ... not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative,"" Norges Bank said.
During his news conference, Olsen declined to say what kind of shock to the Norwegian economy might lead to negative rates.
""The central bank is open for cutting rates to zero, but they raised the thresholds for going into negative rates,"" Danske Bank chief economist Frank Jullum said.
""It is natural that they address the question of negative rates at a time where the central banks in other countries ... are cutting deeper into negative territory,"" said DNB Markets economist Kyrre Aamdal.
The Norwegian crown rose 1 percent against the euro and the dollar on Thursday before reversing its gains at 1017 GMT.
Norway's central bank has been trying to balance the requirements of an economy that has slowed as oil prices plunged with the need to cool down the property market. It has reduced its cost of borrowing from 1.5 percent in December 2014.

On a monthly basis inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro went up by 0.2 percent, Eurostat said, slightly above forecasts. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1 percent increase.
Core inflation, which in the European Central Bank's definition excludes the more volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food, was 0.8 percent year-on-year, confirming the previous Eurostat estimate, but more than expected by economists who forecast a 0.7 percent increase. 
It grew 0.3 percent month-on-month.
Excluding energy, tobacco, food and alcohol, an indicator to which economists pay close attention, euro zone inflation was 0.8 percent yearly and 0.4 percent monthly.
Energy prices were confirmed as the main drag on euro zone inflation. They dropped 8.1 percent in February year-on-year, slightly more than the -8.0 percent previously estimated by Eurostat. Energy prices fell 1.3 percent on a monthly basis.

Prices in the services sector went up 0.9 percent on an annual basis, the highest increase in the price components analyzed by Eurostat.

âAgainst this background, the negative interest rate and the SNBâs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market serve to ease pressure on the Swiss franc.â
The SNB cut its forecast for economic growth this year to between 1% and 1.5%, from approximately 1.5% previously.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan was to comment on the decision at a press conference later in the day.
EUR/CHF was trading at 1.0985 from around 1.0989 ahead of the decision, while USD/CHF was at 0.9742 from 0.9745 earlier.

As expected the Federal Open Market Committee left rates unchanged at the 0.25% to 0.50% range at the end of their two-day meeting, but made a few changes to the post-meeting statement and downgrades to their accompanying economic forecasts.
The FOMC removed any reference to the balance of risks in the statement, saying only ""global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.""
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday less tightening might be needed to achieve those conditions.
""Proceeding cautiously in removing policy accommodation at this time will allow us to verify that the labor market is continuing to strengthen, despite the risks from abroad,"" Yellen said in her press conference.
""Such caution is appropriate,"" Yellen continued, ""given the short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook.""
In the latest Summary of Economic Projections, Fed policymakers lowered their expectations for rate hikes this year bringing their forecast more in line with market expectations.
The median fed funds rate expected to be appropriate at the end of 2016 was lowered to 0.9% from 1.4%. This would imply a range of 0.75% to 1.00% at the endof the year, or two more hikes compared to four expected in the December forecast.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2016 04:34PM ET</span>","U.S. data points to firming economy, inflation ","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. inflation increased more than expected in February as rents and medical costs maintained their upward trend, which could keep the Federal Reserve on course to gradually raise interest rates this year.
Other data on Wednesday showed the housing market continuing to strengthen last month and manufacturing stabilizing. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but acknowledged that inflation ""picked up in recent months."" 
New projections from the U.S. central bank showed policymakers expected two quarter-point rate increases by year-end, half the number seen in December. The combination of stirring inflation, a steady housing sector and tightening labor market have raised the probability of a rate hike in June.
""It looks like the Fed remains really cautious, they are not prepared to move before June at the earliest. Today's numbers, especially the inflation report, is a warning that the days of no price pressures are behind us,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in January. 
That lifted the so-called core CPI 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February, the largest increase since May 2012, after it advanced 2.2 percent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI rising 0.2 percent last month and increasing 2.2 percent from a year ago. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and monitors a price measure that has also pushed higher in recent months. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters temporary factors were likely behind the recent run-up in prices, adding that policymakers expected a gradual rise in inflation. 
""I want to warn that there may be some transitory factors that are influencing that. So I'm wary and haven't yet concluded that we have seen any significant uptick that will be lasting in, for example, in core inflation,"" said Yellen.
The dollar fell to a one-month low against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt gained. U.S. stocks rose, with homebuilding shares such as D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) also getting a boost from the better housing data.
HOUSING, MANUFACTURING IMPROVING
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.18 million units last month, the highest level in five months.
Groundbreaking activity had been held back by adverse weather. While the rebound in housing starts offered a lift to first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates, that was offset by a drop in utilities output as temperatures warmed up in February.
First-quarter growth is forecast around a 2 percent annual rate, an acceleration from the 1.0 percent rate logged in the final three months of 2015.
In a third report, the Fed said industrial production declined 0.5 percent as mining and utilities tumbled. Industrial production rose 0.8 percent in January. But manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent last month after spiking 0.5 percent in January.
The rise in factory output added to manufacturing surveys in suggesting that the downturn in the sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, had probably run its course. Factories have been hit by dollar strength and lower oil prices.
""The overall outlook for the U.S. industrial sector is beginning to look a little better,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York.
The housing sector is being supported by a firming labor market, which is encouraging young adults to leave their parents' homes. But builders cannot keep up with the demand for housing because of a shortage of lots and skilled labor, which is driving rents higher in major metropolitan areas.
The second month of broad increases in the core CPI was driven by a 0.3 percent increase in rents, which followed a similar gain in January. 
Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent after advancing by the same margin in January. Prescription drug prices rose 0.9 percent, while the cost of hospital services increased 0.5 percent. Apparel prices rose by the most in seven years.
The second straight month of increase in apparel prices is rather surprising given that retailers have been giving big discounts to clear unwanted merchandise from their warehouses. 
Consumers also paid more for new motor vehicles and used cars and trucks. But a 13 percent drop in gasoline prices, which offset both the increase in core CPI and a 0.2 percent gain in food prices, lead to the overall CPI falling 0.2 percent in February after being unchanged in January. 

Last month's drop resulted in the CPI increasing 1.0 percent in the 12 months through February, slowing after a 1.4 percent rise in January.

Data released on Wednesday showed U.S. factory output rose 0.2 percent last month, which was a little stronger than the 0.1 percent gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
Overall industrial output fell 0.5 percent during the month, dragged lower by sagging oil production and a drop in utilities output.
Manufacturing makes up roughly a tenth of the U.S. economy and has cooled over the last year, hit by slower overseas demand and several months of dollar appreciation. A steep decline in oil prices also hit the U.S. energy sector, reducing demand in some factories.
But the dollar has weakened recently and the outlook for U.S. domestic demand has improved due to robust job growth. On Wednesday, the dollar was nearly 3 percent weaker against a basket of currencies (DXY) on a year-over-year basis.
In February, U.S. output of goods meant to last at least six months rose 0.4 percent, led by gains in output of primary metals and machinery.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast overall industrial production falling 0.3 percent last month.
The utilities index fell 4 percent after surging 4.2 percent a month earlier.
With output on the rise, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell to 76.7 last month from 77.1 in January.
The Fed views capacity use as a leading indicator in deciding how much further the economy can grow before sparking higher inflation.

Groundbreaking increased 5.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.18 million units, the highest level since September, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
January's starts were revised up to a 1.12 million-unit rate from the previously reported 1.099 million-unit pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.15 million-unit pace last month.
The rebound in groundbreaking activity could lift first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates, which were cut on Tuesday following February's weak retail sales report. The housing sector is being supported by a firming labor market, which is encouraging young adults to leave their parents' homes.
The increase in household formation has largely benefited the multi-family segment of the housing market as many young adults have student debts and little savings to purchase a home.
Labor and land shortages, however, remain a challenge for builders, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Last month, groundbreaking on single-family housing projects, the largest segment of the market, surged 7.2 percent to an 822,000-unit pace, the highest since November 2007. 
Single-family starts in the West rose to their highest level since September 2007. In the South, where most home building takes place, single-family starts were unchanged.
Single-family starts soared 18.6 percent in the Midwest.
Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects tumbled 12.5 percent in the Northeast, likely as ground remained too wet after a major snowstorm in January.
Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 0.8 percent to a 356,000-unit pace. 
Building permits fell 3.1 percent to a 1.17 million-unit rate last month. Permits for the construction of single-family homes rose 0.4 percent last month, while multi-family building permits dropped 8.4 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell less than expected in February, but a sharp downward revision to January's data could reignite concerns about the economy's growth prospects.
Tuesday's weak report from the Commerce Department bucked the trend of recent labor market data that had suggested the economy remained on solid ground despite some fears of a looming recession. 
The data could give the Federal Reserve more reason to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, when it is due to release its latest policy statement.
""The economy's engines are not going into reverse ... but at the moment, it is hard to see GDP with a 2 percent handle. Based on today's lackluster sales report, policymakers will be in no hurry to raise interest rates,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Retail sales dipped 0.1 percent last month as automobile purchases fell and cheaper gasoline undercut receipts at service stations. January's retail sales were revised down to show a 0.4 percent drop instead of the 0.2 percent gain previously reported. 
Underscoring the report's weakness, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent increase in January. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have risen 0.6 percent in January. Economists had forecast retail sales slipping 0.2 percent and core retail sales advancing 0.2 percent in February.
The retail sales report combined with sliding oil prices to push U.S. stocks lower. The S&P 500 retail index <.SPXRT>, however, was little changed. Prices for U.S. government debt were marginally higher, while the dollar (DXY) was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies.
Last month's weak core retail sales reading, together with January's modest gain, suggest that consumer spending will probably remain tepid in the first quarter after growing at a 2.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. 
Still, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, remains supported by a strengthening labor market and rising house prices. Economists cut their first-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 1.9 percent rate after the data.
The economy grew at a 1 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Economic growth prospects were further dented by another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories edging up 0.1 percent in January as sales continued to decline.
That pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio to its highest level since May 2009, suggesting inventories could remain a drag on growth in the near term.
""The buildup looks unintentional. We would not be surprised to see businesses try to rein in inventories in the coming months,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
FED ON HOLD
The reports came as Fed officials gathered for a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to stand pat as policymakers monitor developments on global financial markets, domestic inflation and the labor market.
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month on lower energy and food costs, after edging up 0.1 percent in January. 
In the 12 months through February, the PPI was unchanged after falling 0.2 percent in January. It was the first time since January 2015 that the year-on-year PPI did not decline.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.2 percent in January. The so-called core PPI was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through February, the largest gain since July 2015.
""These increases argue against the idea that deflation risks are spilling over into the U.S. economy,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Retail sales last month were weighed down by a 4.4 percent drop in the value of sales at service stations. Gasoline prices dropped 9 percent in February, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Auto dealerships, furniture retailers and electronics and appliance stores all had lower sales. But there were some pockets of strength, with sales rising at clothing stores and building materials and garden equipment merchants.

Receipts rose at restaurants and bars as well as at sporting goods and hobby stores, showing that consumers still have an appetite for discretionary spending.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices fall; unchanged from a year ago,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell in February on lower energy and food costs, but prices were unchanged from a year ago, suggesting the downward trend was near an end.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI was unchanged after falling 0.2 percent in January. 
It was the first time since January 2015 that the year-on-year PPI did not decline. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI dipping 0.2 percent last month and gaining 0.1 percent from a year ago.
With the dollar losing some momentum after gaining 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015, imported deflation is starting to wane. That could curb further declines in producer prices.
But oil prices, which tumbled by as much as 4 percent on Monday on concerns that a six-week market recovery has gone beyond fundamentals, remain a wild card. So far this year, the dollar has gained about 0.9 percent on a trade-weighted basis. 
Last month, energy prices fell 3.4 percent, with gasoline prices declining 15.1 percent - the biggest drop in a year.
Energy prices fell 5.0 percent in January.
Wholesale food prices decreased 0.3 percent, pulled down by a 19 percent tumble in the cost of fresh and dry vegetables - the largest fall since April 2011. 
Prices for services were unchanged in February after rising for three straight months. 
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.2 percent in January. The so-called core PPI was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through February. That was the largest gain since July 2015 and followed a 0.8 percent increase in January.

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index improved to 0.6 this month from a reading of -16.6 in February. Analysts had expected the index to rise to -10.0 in March.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
The new orders and shipments indexes rose well above zero for the first time in several months, pointing to an increase in both orders and shipments, while price indexes suggested a slight increase in input prices and a small decline in selling prices.
Meanwhile, labor market conditions were little changed, with employment and the average workweek holding fairly steady.
The six-month outlook improved, with the index for future new orders rising to its highest level in more than a year.
The Empire State index is of interest to traders primarily because it is seen as an early forecast of the national Institute for Supply management factory survey.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.1113 from around 1.1109 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.4167 from 1.4170 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 112.71 from 112.89 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 96.60, compared to 96.63 ahead of the report.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that retail sales decreased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, better than expectations for a decline of 0.2%. Retail sales for January were revised to a decline of 0.4% from a previously reported gain of 0.2%.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in February, compared to forecasts for a fall of 0.2%. Core sales in January decreased 0.4%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported gain of 0.1%.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

1416,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 08:33AM ET</span>","U.S. producer prices fall 0.2% in February, core PPI flat","Investing.com - Producer price inflation in the U.S. dropped in February, while core prices remained flat, official data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, in line with the forecast for a 0.2% decline and after a 0.1% increase in January.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) was flat, compared to expectations for an increase of 0.1% and following a drop of 0.2% in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, was also flat in February, below forecasts for a gain of 0.1% and following a rise of 0.4% a month earlier.
Core producer prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.2% last month, above expectations for 1.1% advance and after rising 0.6% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 06:58AM ET</span>","BOJ keeps policy steady, offers gloomier view on economy, inflation","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan said on Tuesday it would maintain its massive asset buying program at existing levels but offered a bleaker view of the economy, suggesting it may roll out more stimulus as it struggles to reach an elusive inflation target.
However, the central bank appeared to back-pedal on its recent radical shift to negative interest rates, highlighting the dilemma the BOJ faces as it struggles to respond to renewed signs of economic weakness with dwindling policy options.
Six weeks after it shocked global financial markets and alarmed the Japanese public by moving to negative rates, the BOJ dropped a reference in a statement after a policy meeting that it will cut negative rates even more deeply if needed.
The BOJ also widened exemptions to its new negative rate policy to include $90 billion in short-term funds dubbed money-reserve funds (MRFs) after the securities industry warned it could curb investment in the stock market.
""Overall, the impression we get from the BOJ's latest policy statement is that the central bank is already de-emphasizing negative interest rates as a policy tool, in response to its poor reception by markets and the public,"" HSBC said in a research note.
As widely expected, the BOJ said it would continue its purchases of government bonds and some riskier equity assets, reiterating its commitment to an 80-trillion-yen ($700 billion) base money target.
It also said it would stick to its new 0.1 percent negative interest rate that applies to some reserves parked by financial institutions at the central bank.
But it offered a gloomier view on the economy and exports in particular than it did in January, as volatile financial markets and sluggish emerging market demand threatened to derail a fragile recovery.
The BOJ also lowered its assessment of inflation expectations to say they were ""weakening recently,"" acknowledging that its massive stimulus was not boosting economic activity as much as it had hoped.
Still, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said external risks could be offset by solid domestic demand and the expected positive effects of negative rates.
""We're clearly seeing the effect of the (negative rate) policy on interest rates. The effect will spread to the economy and prices from now on,"" he told a news conference.
With the economy at risk of falling into recession once again, the BOJ is set to cut its growth and inflation forecasts at a quarterly review in April, sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking have told Reuters.
""The downgrade of the economic assessment is a prelude to further easing,"" said Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center, adding that he expects the BOJ to ease policy again in April.
MORE TO COME?
The BOJ unexpectedly cut a benchmark interest rate below zero in January, but the move has failed to boost stock prices or arrest an unwelcome rise in the yen, drawing criticism from lawmakers for confusing, rather than calming, markets.
Since then, the BOJ has been in damage control with Kuroda scrambling to find positives in the policy which is proving unpopular with both the public and banks.
In a nod to criticism over January's decision, the BOJ removed a line from its statement announcing its policy decision that it will cut interest rates further if necessary.
The central bank also decided to offer greater exemptions from negative rates for financial institutions that use its loan programs to boost lending. Money reserve funds, for example, are a low-risk product that brokerages offer investors to temporarily park their cash while they prepare for stock purchases.
Despite such concessions to banks, two of the nine BOJ board members dissented to maintaining the 0.1 percent negative rate on concern over its potential damage to the financial system.
Kuroda stressed that further rate cuts were not off the table, saying that central banks did not need to wait for the effects of previous stimulus policies to appear in the economy before acting again.
But the unpopularity of negative rates may mean the BOJ will opt to ramp up its asset purchases again, instead of cutting rates more deeply, when it next eases policy to achieve its ambitious 2 percent inflation target, some analysts say.

The BoJ however downgraded its estimates of inflation to a weaker outlook for price growth.
The BoJ has an annual target of Â¥80 trillion in asset purchased and a 0.1% negative interest rate on deposits.
""Although inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, they have recently weakened,"" the BoJ said. In January it said ""some indicators have recently shown relatively weak developments.""
""The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about zero percent for the time being,"" the BoJ repeated.
Two of the four members who voted against adopting the negative interest rate policy at the bank's last meeting in January continued opposing the new tool of monetary easing. They said the BoJ should apply positive 0.1% interest to current account balances excluding the amount outstanding of the required reserves held by financial institutions at the central bank.
Among technical measures for smoothly implementing easing, the board decided to review the scale of current deposits to which the negative 0.1% interest is applied every three months.

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Based on the data available and in line with earlier expectations, growth appeared to have been slightly below average in the December quarter and over 2015 as a whole. There had been further indications of a rebalancing of activity towards the non-mining sectors of the economy. More recent data had suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a moderate pace in early 2016.
As expected, mining investment had fallen further in the December quarter as more large projects reached completion. The latest ABS capital expenditure (capex) survey of firms' investment intentions had pointed to further large falls in mining investment in 2015/16 and again in 2016/17, in line with the forecasts presented in the February Statement on Monetary Policy. Members noted that non-mining investment appeared to have been little changed over 2015. Although the capex survey had pointed to declines in 2015/16 and 2016/17, roughly half of non-mining investment was not covered by the capex survey and in the past there had been differences between signals provided by the capex survey and what was measured in the national accounts data. At the same time, members noted that survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained at above-average levels and business credit growth had increased a little further over recent months.Members observed that there had been only modest growth in resource export volumes in the December quarter. They noted that more production capacity â particularly for liquefied natural gas, but also iron ore â was expected to come on line over 2016. Chinese iron ore imports had increased over the past year, although by less than earlier years, and Australia's share of that had remained at a high level. The volume of coal exports had fallen, partly because Chinese demand for coal had eased. Meanwhile, iron ore prices had increased over the past month, while coal prices had fallen slightly. Notwithstanding the recent increases in iron ore prices, bulk commodity prices were still about 20 per cent below levels of a year earlier. Oil prices had been volatile over recent months, rising somewhat since the previous meeting but still lower than late last year, which largely reflected the ongoing strength of supply.
Members noted that household demand had continued to be supported by low interest rates and above-average employment growth. Consumption growth was expected to have been close to its average over 2015 and in early 2016. Survey measures of households' perceptions of their own finances had remained at above-average levels into early 2016. Information from the Bank's retail liaison suggested that there had been an improvement in trading conditions around the ChristmasâNew Year period.
While growth in dwelling investment had been strong over 2015, there were indications that it would gradually moderate over the course of this year. The level of building approvals had declined over 2015, but remained high. Conditions in the established housing market had eased since late 2015. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne was lower than in September last year. Meanwhile, housing credit growth overall had remained around 7Â½ per cent, after having risen through to the middle of 2015. Members noted that growth in lending to investors in housing had slowed significantly over that period and, more recently, housing loan approvals overall had declined a little.
The unemployment rate rose to 6 per cent in January, from around 5Â¾ per cent in November and December, and employment had declined slightly. Nevertheless, conditions in the labour market had clearly improved since early 2015. Employment growth had been above average, the unemployment rate had declined by a little more than Â¼ percentage point and the participation rate had been on an upward trend. Members noted that there was some uncertainty around the future trajectory of the participation rate. This was partly because the degree to which people had been encouraged to enter the labour force over the course of the past year had been unexpected, and partly because it was difficult to assess the net effect on the participation rate of population ageing (which tends to reduce participation rates). The fact that each generation has tended to have a higher participation rate than the one preceding it also contributed to uncertainty around the trajectory of the participation rate. Meanwhile, leading indicators of employment had increased recently, consistent with employment growth in the months ahead.
Data from the wage price index had confirmed that wage growth was low across all industries over 2015. Although wage growth had continued to slow in a number of mining-exposed industries, it appeared to have stabilised in some industries where employment growth had been relatively strong over the course of the past year. Members observed that ongoing low wage growth was consistent with there being some spare capacity in the labour market, though they also noted that this was not unique to Australia, which suggested that a common global factor, such as the increasingly globalised nature of the labour force, could have been playing a role.
International Economic Conditions
Growth in Australia's major trading partners had eased in the December quarter, although it had been little changed over the past year at slightly below its decade average. Labour market conditions had improved in a number of economies, which was consistent with ongoing consumption growth, particularly in the United States and the euro area. Aggregate growth had also been supported by low oil prices. Although measures of core inflation had edged higher over the second half of 2015 in Japan and the euro area, they had shown some signs of declining in the early part of 2016. There had been a more noticeable increase in core inflation in the United States over this period. However, inflation remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policies had remained very expansionary.
Growth in the US economy had been close to trend over 2015, despite slowing late in the year. Employment had continued to grow more rapidly than the working-age population, and the unemployment rate was around its long-run average level. While nominal wage growth had remained relatively modest, growth in unit labour costs was above its long-run average. Measures of core inflation had picked up, but remained below the inflation objective of the Federal Reserve Board. The euro area economy had continued to expand at an above-trend rate over 2015, driven by domestic demand, although industrial activity had remained weak. There had been a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate, but there was considerable spare capacity and wage growth had drifted lower. Inflation had remained low relative to the European Central Bank's target.
GDP had contracted in Japan in the December quarter, driven by a decline in consumption. Despite recent weakness in economic activity, labour market conditions had remained tight and nominal wage growth had been positive. Core inflation had picked up to close to 1 per cent by the end of 2015, but had eased a little in early 2016. Headline inflation had been low, reflecting the effect of lower oil prices. In the rest of east Asia, GDP growth had been a bit below average, particularly for the economies with larger exposures to the slowing in China through their direct trade links. Recent exchange rate depreciations, low oil prices and monetary and fiscal stimulus measures had been providing some support for activity in the east Asian region.
Recent Chinese data had pointed to continued weakness in the industrial and real estate sectors, although members noted that the variable timing of the Chinese New Year holidays made it difficult to interpret data in the early part of the calendar year. Overall, housing prices had increased a little over the past year, but prices had still declined in the smaller cities. Total sales had declined since mid 2015 and the stock of unsold housing remained substantial. In February, the authorities took further steps to support the demand for housing, particularly in markets where housing prices had been weakest. The downward trend in both exports and imports had continued in January, while the trade surplus remained at a high level.
Members spent part of the meeting discussing some issues relevant to China's longer-run economic performance and the risks to growth. They observed that demographic changes and strong productivity growth had been key drivers of economic growth in China for some time, but these forces were now reversing and were likely to weigh on future growth as a result. In particular, China's growth had been supported by an increase in the size of the working-age population and the migration of many agricultural workers to urban areas, where they had been more productive. The working-age population had started to fall but the urban workforce was still growing because of continued urbanisation. China's urbanisation rate was still relatively low by international standards, which suggested that this process had further to run, with the pace of reform to the urban registration system (hukou) likely to have some effect on how rapidly the growth of the urban workforce would moderate. Structural reform was also important for the future trajectory of productivity growth, which had slowed over the past decade.
China's economic development had been characterised by very strong investment growth, which had been funded to a significant extent by high saving rates in the household sector. An element of the policy response to the global financial crisis had been to increase the credit available to the non-financial corporate and government sectors, which had led to sizeable increases in the debt held by these sectors. Slowing aggregate growth and excess capacity in some industries had raised the risk that some firms would find it more difficult to make repayments on their debt, which could, at some point, be associated with more widespread financial problems. Notwithstanding this, members noted that household debt-to-income ratios and the share of debt denominated in foreign currency were both low. The low level of foreign currency debt, in particular, differentiated China from other emerging economies that had previously experienced financial crises. While the overhang of residential housing inventory and excess capacity in the industrial sector would affect demand for Australia's resource exports and their prices, the scope for Chinese household incomes to rise over time created long-run potential for Australia to increase exports of rural produce and services, including tourism, to China.
Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with a review of movements in a range of markets following the Bank of Japan's unexpected lowering of the interest rate for some deposits held at the central bank in order to provide further stimulus. This decision led to significant movements in fixed income and foreign exchange markets in particular, and had also highlighted concerns over bank profits in an environment of low or negative interest rates. Members noted that implementation of the policy decision had been designed to minimise the adverse effect on the Japanese banking system; although the negative rate is effectively the marginal rate on excess funds and therefore had pushed other short-term rates lower, most central bank deposits continued to be remunerated with a positive rate.
Expectations of further increases in the US federal funds rate had been pushed out over the past month, with markets now pricing in only a 70 per cent chance of a further rate rise in 2016 and some market participants expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate this year. In contrast, expectations for additional monetary easing by the European Central Bank this year had increased over the past month, including at the next policy meeting later in the month.
Recent policy developments had contributed to further falls in sovereign bond yields. Members noted that the Japanese government bond yield curve was very flat, with the 10-year bond yield below zero. Almost two-thirds of Japanese government bonds and one-third of short-term bonds issued by euro area governments were currently trading at yields below zero. Australian government bond yields had moved broadly in line with US sovereign bonds.
The sharp declines in global share prices in early February, led by financial sector shares, had, more recently, been partly retraced by price rises. Australian equity prices declined by 2 per cent over February, with movements in prices closely linked to changes in commodity prices. Members noted the generally solid profit reports of Australian listed companies and discussed recent developments in relation to dividend policies.
Share prices of banks in the advanced economies, including Australia, had fallen significantly since early January. The declines had been largest in Europe and Japan. Globally, there had been concerns about the effect of the prevailing low or negative interest rates on interest margins and yields on banks' high-quality liquid asset holdings and, ultimately, on bank profits and business models. These concerns had been compounded in the euro area by specific issues in particular countries as well as uncertainty about the operation of the new European bank resolution regime.
In foreign exchange markets, volatility increased over the previous month alongside the changing current and prospective stance of monetary policy in the major economies. The US dollar had depreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, while the euro was little changed. Since the policy announcement by the Bank of Japan, the yen had appreciated by 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The Chinese authorities had emphasised their intention to preserve stability in the trade-weighted value of the renminbi, which had moved in only a narrow range over the past year. The People's Bank of China had continued to sell foreign currency reserves in January in response to net private capital outflow. The Australian dollar was little changed on a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar since the previous meeting.
Bond issuance by Australian banks had been solid in the first quarter to date, despite volatility in global financial markets in the period. Wholesale funding costs for Australian banks had continued to edge higher, but for long-term funding the cost of issuing new paper was still below the average cost of the existing stock on issue. The rise in short-term wholesale bank funding costs had been passed through to some business lending rates.
Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that there was no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the present meeting.Considerations for Monetary PolicyIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the recent data on the international and domestic economies had been largely consistent with the outlook presented at the previous meeting. Growth in Australia's major trading partners had remained a little below average in year-ended terms and commodity prices were still significantly lower than they had been a year earlier. Meanwhile, global financial markets had been volatile in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision to implement negative interest rates and generally there appeared to be more uncertainty about the direction and potency of monetary policy in the major jurisdictions. However, given the usual lags in the data, it was still too early to assess whether the bout of financial market volatility since the turn of the year foreshadowed or would lead to a weakening in global economic conditions. Globally, monetary policy remained very accommodative.
The available data suggested that the domestic economy had continued to grow at a slightly below-trend pace. There had also been further signs of a rebalancing of activity towards non-mining sectors of the economy, aided by the low level of interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past couple of years, which had responded to the evolving economic outlook. There was a small decline in employment in January and a modest rise in the unemployment rate, following a run of much better-than-expected outcomes in the December quarter. Leading indicators of employment had increased further and were consistent with employment growth in the months ahead. Wage growth had remained at quite low levels.
Conditions in the established housing market had eased somewhat since September 2015, in part reflecting the effect of supervisory measures implemented in that year. In addition, after rising for some time, the growth in aggregate housing credit had stabilised over the past six months or so, with a significant easing in growth in lending to investors.
Members judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy and that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at an accommodative setting. Over the period ahead, new information should allow the Board to assess whether the improvement in labour market conditions was continuing and whether the recent financial turbulence presaged weaker global and domestic demand. Members noted that continued low inflation would provide scope to ease monetary policy further, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.
The Decision

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2016 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. multifamily mortgages grew at fastest pace since 1993,"(Reuters) - The amount of outstanding U.S. mortgages for multifamily homes rose to $1.06 trillion in 2015, up 10.4 percent from a year earlier, which was its fastest annual pace since 1993, a U.S. industry group said on Monday.
The rise in multifamily loans helped propel the growth in commercial real estate mortgages by the largest amount since 2007, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
Last year's pickup in commercial lending coincided with the resilience in the single-family housing market in a steady U.S. economy.
Home resales jumped by a record of nearly 15 percent at an annual pace of 5.47 million units in 2015, while housing starts average over 1.11 million units last year, the highest since 2007.
The Washington-based group, however, cautioned the recent market turbulence, if it were to persist together with regulatory changes, would disrupt the robust trend.
""While 2015 marked many new records, recent market and regulatory changes have the potential to impact the availability of commercial and multifamily mortgage debt during 2016,â said Jamie Woodwell, MBAâs vice president of commercial real estate research, in a statement.
The amount of commercial mortgage debt outstanding at the end of 2015 was $184.5 billion or 7.0 percent above a year-ago at $2.83 trillion.
In the fourth quarter, it rose $59.7 billion or 2.2 percent from the prior quarter. Multifamily loans outstanding increased $35.4 billion or 3.4 percent during this period. 

Developers broke ground at a rate of 382,000 multifamily homes at the end of 2015, compared with 356,000 units a year earlier. Â

Industrial production in the 19-member single currency zone was 2.1 percent higher in January than in December, Eurostat said, and grew by 2.8 percent year-on-year.
The data were significantly higher than expectations and followed two months of declines. Economists polled by Reuters had forecasts a 1.7 percent month-on-month increase, and an output rise of only 1.4 percent on a yearly basis.
Eurostat also revised up the December figures, which now showed a monthly output fall of only 0.5 percent instead of the 1.0 percent decrease estimated earlier. Year-on-year, the figure was revised up sharply to a decline of 0.1 percent from a previous estimate of a 1.3 percent drop.
Output growth in January was driven mostly by capital goods, an indicator of future industrial investments, which saw a 3.9 percent monthly rise.
Production increased 2.4 percent for both energy and non-durable consumer goods. Output of durable consumer goods, such as fridges or cars, went up 1.3 percent.
All major economies of the euro zone expanded production in January, compared to the previous month, reversing a two-month negative trend in the euro zone.
In Germany, the bloc's largest economy, industrial output rose 2.9 percent in January on a monthly basis. In France production grew 1.4 percent, and in Italy output by 1.9 percent.
Buckling the trend, Spain, the fourth biggest economy of the euro zone, experienced a 0.2 percent industrial output decrease on a monthly basis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell in February for an eighth straight month, weighed down by declining costs for petroleum and a range of other goods, but the pace of decline is slowing as the dollar's rally fades and oil prices stabilize.
The Labor Department said on Friday import prices slipped 0.3 percent last month after a 1.0 percent decrease in January. Import prices have decreased in 18 of the last 20months, reflecting a robust dollar and plunging oil prices.
They were down 6.1 percent in the 12 months through February, the smallest year-on-year drop since December 2014. Weak import prices have contributed to holding inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
""We strongly feel that the peaks in both overall and core disinflation pressures are behind us,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The import deflation is likely close to an end as the dollar's appreciation loses some steam after the greenback gained about 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015.
So far this year, the dollar has strengthened about 0.9 percent on a trade-weighted basis. At the same time, oil prices have also shown tentative signs of stabilizing. Should these trends continue, import prices could start to rise soon and help to push up domestic inflation.
IMPROVING TREND
""Prospects of higher oil prices and slower dollar appreciation should help keep this improving trend intact,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Reports last month showed a broad pick-up in prices in January, raising optimism among economists that inflation will rise toward the Fed's target and allow the U.S. central bank to continue gradually raising interest rates this year.
The Fed increased its key overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Economists had forecast import prices slipping 0.6 percent last month.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, taking their cue from firming oil prices. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. The dollar was flat versus a basket of currencies. Last month, imported petroleum prices fell 4.0 percent after plummeting 14.3 percent in January. Import prices excluding petroleum dipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in January.
Imported food prices fell 2.0 percent last month, the largest drop since February 2012, while prices for industrial supplies and materials excluding petroleum slipped 0.3 percent.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2016 03:00AM ET</span>","Business mood sours, capex plans tank as Japan skirts recession","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment worsened sharply in the first quarter and next fiscal year's capital expenditure plans were the weakest since 2009, suggesting recent financial market turbulence and sluggish global demand were taking a toll on a fragile economic recovery.
Confidence soured for both manufacturers and service-sector firms for the first time since the second quarter of 2014, when private consumption took a hit from an increase in sales tax in April of that year.
The sentiment data keeps pressure on policymakers to deploy additional fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to reflate an economy that is skirting another recession.
The Bank of Japan meets for a rate review next week, while premier Shinzo Abe has signaled that delaying a scheduled second hike in the sales tax next year could be a real possibility.
An index measuring large manufacturers' sentiment swung to minus 7.9 in January-March from plus 3.8 in October-December, worsening for the first time in three quarters, according to a joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and a research arm of the Cabinet Office.
""Weak exports and the yen's appreciation appear to have affected manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank. ""Overall, the data suggests companies don't have a positive outlook for the global economy.""
The index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment three months ahead stood at minus 3.5, a sign the gloomy outlook may discourage companies from boosting wages or capital expenditure, given sluggish demand in China and other emerging Asian markets.
Underscoring weakness in domestic demand, non-manufacturers' sentiment also worsened for the first time in seven quarters to minus 0.7.
Companies expect capital expenditure to have risen 8.8 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March, but see it shrinking 6.6 percent in the coming business year, the survey showed.
The spending plan for next fiscal year would be the weakest since a 28.5 percent drop marked for fiscal 2009, when the global economy was reeling from the financial turmoil caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara put on a brave face, stressing that the hit to sentiment from volatile markets could be offset by Abe's stimulus policies aimed at generating a positive cycle of rising corporate profits leading to higher spending.
""The sentiment data partly reflects recent volatility in stocks and the currency market. However, it's not all bad news,"" Ishihara told a news conference after the data was issued. 
""I think companies are willing to invest given the low interest rate environment we are in now.""
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, shrank in the final quarter of 2015 as slow wage growth and sluggish global demand hurt consumption and exports.
While many analysts expect growth to have rebounded modestly in the current quarter, the bleak outlook for global demand has led some to predict another contraction that will push Japan back into technical recession - defined as two straight quarters of economic contraction.

The sentiment index measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Machinery orders, Japan's leading indicator of capital spending, are expected to have risen modestly in January for a second straight month, a Reuters poll showed, but deepening concerns over economic prospects have cast doubt on a sustained recovery.
Exports were expected to fall for a fifth straight month in February as emerging economies such as China remained weak, while imports likely dropped for a 14 consecutive month on slack domestic demand and low oil prices holding down energy costs. 
The poll of 19 economists found that core machinery orders, a volatile data series regarded as a useful leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were expected to rise 3.0 percent in January from December.
In December, machinery orders rose 4.2 percent after dropping 14.4 percent in November, the fastest month-on-month decline since May 2014.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude ships and electrical gear, were seen to have declined 3.6 percent in January, the poll showed.
""There is a possibility that worries about the global and domestic economic outlook impacted corporate sentiment on capex, but some firms appear to have carried out their solid capex plan,"" Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said in a report.
""But, through January-March, the chance probably has risen that firms could revise down their capex plans and postpone them.""
The cabinet office will release the data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT, Sunday). 
TRADE EXPECTED TO DECLINE 
Exports were expected to have declined 3.1 percent in February from a year ago and imports to have dropped 15.2 percent, down for a 14th straight month, when the finance ministry releases trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday (2350 GMT, Wednesday). 
This was expected to produce a February trade surplus of 388.6 billion yen ($3.43 billion), taking trade back into surplus from a revised 648.8 billion yen deficit in January.
The Bank of Japan is set to hold off cutting interest rates at next week's rate review, sources told Reuters, as it works to soothe market jitters caused by January's surprise decision to adopt negative interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, hitting its lowest level since October, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market that should further dispel fears of a recession.Â Â Â  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended March 5, the lowest reading since mid-October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
""The labor market continues to be the light shining through the foggy state of the global economy ... the recent improvement in a host of economic data should provide a bit of relief that the expansion still has legs,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.Â  
Jobless claims are being watched for signs of labor market weakness following a recent massive stock market sell-off that caused a tightening in financial market conditions amid slowing global growth and fears the U.S. economy was heading into recession. 
So far, the jobs market remains on strong footing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 242,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.
The recession fears have also been soothed by strong consumer spending at the start of the year, as well as signs of some stabilization in the troubled manufacturing sector.
A tightening labor market and firming inflation could see the Federal Reserve gradually raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
""A data dependent Fed should be focused on these developments and see that the most up-to-date, high-frequency measure of economic activity in the U.S. shows no signs of slackening growth in response to market volatility and developments abroad,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The Fed is, however, not expected to raise borrowing costs at its meeting next week.
U.S. stock were little changed after opening higher following the European Central Bank's decision to lower key interest rates and expand its bond purchase program in an effort to stimulate growth in the euro zone. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 275,000 last week. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year - the longest run since the early 1970s. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 267,500 last week, the lowest level since late October.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 2.23 million in the week ended Feb. 27. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 2.25 million.

Continuing jobless claims in the week ended February 27 declined to 2.225 million from 2.257 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to dip to 2.255 million.
The four-week moving average was 267,500, a decline of 2,500 from the previous week's 270,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The ECB said it was lowering its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 0.0% from 0.05%, surprising market players who were expecting no change.
The central bank also cut its deposit facility rate to -0.4% from -0.3%, in line with market expectations. Meanwhile, the central bank reduced its marginal lending rate to 0.25% from 0.30%.
The ECB also said it was to increase the size of its monthly quantitative easing program to approximately â¬80 billion from the current â¬60 billion, starting in April, with investment-grade bonds added to the mix of assets eligible for purchase.
The central bank also announced new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be launched in June.

PARIS (Reuters) - French industrial output reached its highest level in more than four years in January and job creation last year was the fastest since 2007, data showed on Thursday.
Coming after Germany reported its fastest industrial output rise in six years this week, the data for the euro zone's second-largest economy could temper concerns that a slowdown in emerging markets is spreading to the euro zone.
French industrial output rose 1.3 percent in January from December, beating the 0.8 percent economists expected on average, to reach its highest level since December 2011, figures from the INSEE statistics agency showed on Thursday. <FRIP=ECI>
""Today's outcome marks a strong entry of industrial production into the quarter,"" UniCredit economist Tullia Bucco said in a note.
The December figure was also revised up significantly to show a dip of 0.6 percent instead of the 1.6 percent decline previously reported, with INSEE saying it had revised seasonal adjustments and weights as well as the baseline year.
Manufacturing output, which strips out the impact of volatile energy production, rose by 0.8 percent in January and was up by a strong 2.6 percent over a year, especially in the transport, electronics and agro-food sectors.
A lower euro making French goods more competitive, cheap oil prices and the government's 40 billion euro ($43.9 billion) tax cut package are likely to have helped boost production.
Although recent surveys by the Bank of France and private pollster Markit have pointed to weaker sentiment in February, hard data has surprised on the upside.
""It dismisses to some extent the mixed message from business surveys up to February, especially the PMIs, which may have been affected by increased by financial market volatility,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Francois Cabau said.
In another encouraging sign for President Francois Hollande's government, the statistics office revised up the number of jobs created last year to 82,300, from 47,100 previously, the highest since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
By contrast, France had lost 62,800 jobs in 2014.
Finance Minister Michel Sapin struck a cautiously optimistic tone during a press briefing with reporters, saying that increases in the working population will curb any impact on the jobless rate.
""For unemployment to drop, we need to create 100,000 jobs. We're getting there,"" he said.
The better job creation data comes after a fall in the French unemployment rate in the fourth quarter to 10.3 percent and a sharp drop in the number of jobless people in January, giving some rare relief to Hollande who has staked his political future on the job curve.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept its policy on hold on Thursday and its chief suggested he was not ready to ease policy soon, dampening bond futures prices and bolstering the won currency.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held the policy rate <KROCRT=ECI> steady at record-low 1.50 percent for a ninth consecutive month. One of the seven members voted for a 25 basis-point cut, as he did last month.
""We will have to see what oil prices will be like going forward, but they have come up considerably and U.S. economic indicators are showing upbeat trends,"" Governor Lee Ju-yeol told reporters.
""I believe this will be positive for the global economy, improve export conditions, and also help in stabilizing global markets,"" he said.
Lee noted that upside and downside risks to the economy appeared to be balanced.
The won <KRW=> rose as much as 0.8 percent against the dollar as Lee sounded less dovish on future policy than many traders had expected. Bond futures fell, with the March contract on three-year treasury bonds down 0.16 points.
The won's rally continued even after North Korea added to existing tensions between the two Koreas saying on Thursday it would liquidate South Korean assets left in the North.
""There's no sign of the economic conditions improving during March, but having said that, I can't say for sure that chances will grow for a rate cut in April,"" Stephen Lee, economist at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities, said of the governor's remarks.
Twenty-two of the 33 analysts polled by Reuters before Thursday's decision saw steady rates from the March meeting. Of those who saw rates on hold this week, however, 13 respondents said the BOK would cut rates in April or some time later in the year.
The Bank of Korea has been facing mounting pressure to lower borrowing costs in the past few weeks as indicators have shown little evidence of Asia's fourth-largest economy rebounding.
Lee dismissed an argument that the Bank of Korea may need to lower interest rates to weaken the won currency and keep exporters competitive, saying the effect of a rate cut on the currency's value was uncertain.
The central bank will also revise in April its economic forecasts for this year and 2017, which are expected to be downgraded. The BOK's growth projection for this year currently stands at 3.0 percent.
Cratering exports have weighed on the economy as shipments fell for a 14th straight month in February in the country's longest falling streak, but Governor Lee shrugged it off by saying on Thursday it was a global pattern and that South Korea was in fact faring relatively well.

January factory output declined at the fastest pace in a year as production of key export products fell. Government data out on Wednesday showed that production overall in South Korea has weakened.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumer inflation beat forecasts in February, accelerating at its fastest pace since July 2014, while producer prices slowed their slide for the second straight month, taking some pressure off policymakers to rush out more monetary easing.
While the food-driven consumer price increase is likely to be welcomed by regulators worried that China could fall into a deflationary trap, some economists expect upward price pressures in the months ahead to be modest.
Annual consumer inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, from January's 1.8 percent and above the 1.9 percent predicted by analysts.
That was the fastest year-on-year increase since July 2014. 
A 7.3 percent pick-up in food prices was mainly due to cold weather and the Chinese New Year seasonality effect, Yu Qiumei, a senior NBS statistician, said in a statement accompanying the data. Non-food inflation was 1.0 percent.
""Inflation is much higher than expectations,"" said Guo Lei, chief economist at Founder Securities, in Shanghai. 
""The recent rebound in oil prices, recovery in food prices and surging home prices in big cities all contributed to higher inflation in February. We think inflation will not surpass the government target of 3 percent this year but the rising inflation will obviously restrict room for further policy easing."" 
China aims to keep consumer inflation at around 3 percent in 2016 to reflect factors such as rising labor cost, price fluctuations of agricultural products and the impact of further price reform.
""A target of higher price increases will be conducive to reducing expectations of deflation,"" the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's top economic planner, said in a work report on Saturday.
China's consumer price index rose 1.4 percent in 2015 from a year ago, far short of Beijing's 3 percent target for 2015.
Despite February's encouraging headline numbers, ANZ economists say the rise in food prices is likely to be temporary and that consumer inflation will remain mild in coming months.
""Daily wholesale food prices show that prices have moderated slightly in early March,"" ANZ said in a research note.
""Non-food CPI edged down to 1.0 percent year-on-year in February, 0.2 percentage points lower than that in January, reflecting disinflation in the other components of the CPI.""
Reflecting sluggish demand at home and overseas and overcapacity in key sectors, China's producer prices remained stubbornly weak, with the producer price index sliding 4.9 percent in February from a year ago.
Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.
China's trade data released on Tuesday also showed entrenched weakness in the economy as exports tumbled at their fastest pace in more than over six years and imports fell for 16th straight month.

1478,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2016 08:33PM ET</span>",China consumer prices up more than expected in February,"Investing.com - Consumer prices in China rose at a faster pace than expected in February, setting the stage for a tighter corridor to ease monetary policy in the face of slowing growth, official data said on Wednesday.
In China CPI for February rose 1.6%, above the gain of 1.1% expected month-on-month for a year-on-year pace of 2.3%, well above the 1.9% seen. Producer price data fell 4.9% year-on-year as expected.
""The continued pick-up in inflation last month was mostly seasonal,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
The key driver was a jump in food price inflation, from 4.1% y/y to 7.3%. A combination of unusually cold weather and a surge in demand during Chinese New Year pushed up food prices last month. In contrast, non-food inflation edged down from 1.2% y/y to 1.0%. A fall back in tourism cost inflation, which jumped in January ahead of the holiday, was largely responsible.""
On producer prices, Capital Economics said the data was expected.
'It remains deep in negative territory because global commodity price deflation is still weighing on the price of industrial inputs, which make up 75% of the index. We arenât overly concerned by this since with the price of domestic goods holding up better, many firms should actually benefit from these lower input costs.""
""Looking ahead, we expect consumer price inflation to fall back soon as the seasonal pressures on food prices subside. Stepping back though, inflation does look set to edge higher this year as the sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities over the past year drop out of the base for comparison and looser monetary and fiscal policy help to stoke broader domestic price pressures. That said, we donât expect inflation to get out of control. We are forecasting consumer price inflation of 2.5% y/y this year, which would still be below the governmentâs annual target of 3% set at the recent opening of the National Peopleâs Congress. As such we donât think that rising inflation will prevent further policy easing over the coming quarters.""

At the OCR review which was also accompanied by a full quarterly Monetary Policy Statement, the signaled more easing may be required with the 90-day bill track suggesting a projection of one more 25 basis points cut.
""Further policy easing may be required to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range. We will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data,"" the RBNZ said.
""In the case of either lower world commodity prices or higher funding costs, a lower OCR may be required to ensure inflation trends towards the midpoint to the target range, and inflation expectations remain well anchored near 2%,"" the statement said.
Here's the statement:
Statement by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today reduced the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent.
The outlook for global growth has deteriorated since the December Monetary Policy Statement, due to weaker growth in China and other emerging markets, and slower growth in Europe. This is despite extraordinary monetary accommodation, and further declines in interest rates in several countries. Financial market volatility has increased, reflected in higher credit spreads. Commodity prices remain low.
Domestically, the dairy sector faces difficult challenges, but domestic growth is expected to be supported by strong inward migration, tourism, a pipeline of construction activity and accommodative monetary policy.
The trade-weighted exchange rate is more than 4 percent higher than projected in December, and a decline would be appropriate given the weakness in export prices.
House price inflation in Auckland has moderated in recent months, but house prices remain at high levels and additional housing supply is needed. Housing market pressures have been building in some other regions.
There are many risks to the outlook. Internationally, these are to the downside and relate to the prospects for global growth, particularly around China, and the outlook for global financial markets. The main domestic risks relate to weakness in the dairy sector, the decline in inflation expectations, the possibility of continued high net immigration, and pressures in the housing market.
Headline inflation remains low, mostly due to continued falls in prices for fuel and other imports. Annual core inflation, which excludes the effects of transitory price movements, is higher, at 1.6 percent.
While long-run inflation expectations are well-anchored at 2 percent, there has been a material decline in a range of inflation expectations measures. This is a concern because it increases the risk that the decline in expectations becomes self-fulfilling and subdues future inflation outcomes.
Headline inflation is expected to move higher over 2016, but take longer to reach the target range. Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative. Further policy easing may be required to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range. We will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in January. December inventories were revised up to show them unchanged instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories falling 0.2 percent in January.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - edged up 0.1 percent in January.
Government data last week showed businesses had made less progress than initially thought reducing the inventory bloat in the fourth quarter. Inventories subtracted just over one-tenth of a percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth.
Businesses accumulated record inventory in the first half of 2015, which outpaced demand. Though the pace of accumulation slowed, inventories remained high in the second half of the year, posing a downside risk to 2016 GDP growth.
A report last week showed inventories at factories fell in January for a seventh straight month.
In January, sales at wholesalers declined 1.3 percent after sliding 0.6 percent in December. At January's sales pace it would take 1.35 months to clear shelves, the highest ratio since April 2009, compared with 1.33 months in December.
That high ratio suggests the so-called inventory correction at wholesalers could continue for a while and hurt manufacturing and overall economic growth.

The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.50%, in line with market expectations. All 25 analysts in a recent Bloomberg survey had forecast that the Canadian central bank would stand pat.
Furthermore, experts explained that the BoC was unlikely to make a move pending the publication of the government budget which will be released on March 22.
In the statement, the BoC noted that the global economy is progressing as it had anticipated in it's January report.
Financial market volatility, reflecting heightened concerns about economic momentum, appears to be abating. Although downside risks remain, the Bank still expects global growth to strengthen this year and next.
At the same time, the low level of oil prices will continue to dampen growth in Canada and other energy-producing countries.
Prices of oil and other commodities have rebounded in recent weeks. In this context, and in light of shifting expectations for monetary policy in Canada and the United States, the Canadian dollar has appreciated from its recent lows. With these movements, both the price of oil and the exchange rate have averaged close to levels assumed in the Bank's January report.
Additionally, GDP growth in the Canadian economy the fourth quarter was not as weak as tthe BoC had expected, although it admitted that the the near-term outlook for the economy remains broadly the same as in January.
National employment has held up despite job losses in resource-intensive regions, and household spending continues to underpin domestic demand. Non-energy exports are gathering momentum, particularly in sectors that are sensitive to exchange rate movements.
The BoC further recognized that inflation was evolving as expected. ""The factors that pushed total CPI inflation up to 2 per cent will likely unwind in the months ahead,"" the bank explained.
Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.

Industrial output rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 0.5 percent.
Output in manufacturing rose 0.7 percent on the month following a 0.3 percent dip, the first increase for four months and easily topping expectations for a 0.2 percent uptick. 
The monthly Markit/CIPS survey of British manufacturers also showed the sector enjoyed an unexpectedly strong January, but it then suggested factory activity barely grew last month. 
Britain has been one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world for the last couple of years. But it has relied heavily on domestically focused services for growth, frustrating hopes for a better-balanced recovery.
Economic growth slowed in the second half of last year and economists say it could lose more momentum in early 2016.
Industrial output was still 10.2 percent below its peak in early 2008 during the three months to January 2016, while manufacturing output was 6.4 percent smaller.
The manufacturing sector failed to contribute to British economic growth last year.
Finance minister George Osborne has warned that the economy was facing a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks from overseas in 2016, as growth slows in major emerging markets, stock markets tumble and oil prices slump amid fading global demand.
Economists say that the Britain's planned referendum on its European Union membership could also drag on growth.
North Sea oil and gas extraction fell 6.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop since June 2014, which the ONS said could be linked to bad weather.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said its small business optimism index dropped one point to a reading of 92.9 last month, with none of the index's components showing an increase. The index decreased 1.3 percentage points in January. 
""Spending and hiring plans weakened a bit as expectations for growth in real sales volumes fell. Earnings trends worsened a bit as owners continued to report widespread gains in worker compensation while holding the line on price increases,"" the NFIB said in statement.
The sustained weakness is at odds with economic data such as employment, consumer spending and manufacturing that have suggested a pick-up in economic activity after growth slowed to a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter are currently above a 2 percent rate.
Six components of the NFIB index fell last month, while the remaining four were unchanged. 

Labor market gauges softened slightly and the NFIB said that likely reflected the tepid economic growth in the fourth quarter as the employment question in the survey was backward looking.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy contracted less than initially estimated in the final quarter of 2015 but private consumption remained weak, underscoring the challenges facing premier Shinzo Abe in restoring growth amid intensifying overseas headwinds.
While many analysts expect growth to have rebounded modestly in the current quarter, the bleak outlook for global demand has led some to predict another contraction that will push Japan back into technical recession - defined as two straight quarters of shrinking growth.
The weak economic backdrop will keep the Bank of Japan under pressure to further expand monetary stimulus, although central bank policymakers meeting for a rate review next week are wary of acting so soon after adopting negative interest rates late in January.
Sluggish growth could also heighten market speculation that Abe may delay a second consumption tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent scheduled in April next year, some analysts say.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, shrank an annualized 1.1 percent in October-December, less than a preliminary estimate of a 1.4 percent contraction, Cabinet Office data showed on Tuesday. That compared with a median market forecast for a revision to a 1.5 percent contraction.
""Economic indicators in January are weak. The economy likely won't rebound significantly in January-March,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The government may adopt some form of stimulus steps and may delay the sales tax hike if growth is weak in January-March and prospects emerge that it will stay stagnant in April-June.""
Growth in capital expenditure was revised up to a 1.5 percent increase from a preliminary 1.4 percent rise. Private consumption fell 0.9 percent, slightly more than a preliminary 0.8 percent decline estimated earlier.
Taken together, domestic demand shaved 0.4 percentage point off growth, against a preliminary negative contribution of 0.5 point.
CONSUMER MOOD SOURS
Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara said there was no change to the government's view that Japan's fundamentals were strong.
But separate data showed consumer confidence fell for a second straight month in February to hit a one-year low, a sign Abe's efforts to lift the economy clear of decades of deflation and stagnation are under threat.
The government has begun informally discussing a delay to the sales tax hike, as Abe prepares for elections with household spending less than it was when he came to office.
Analysts polled by Reuters before Tuesday's data release expect Japan's economy to expand an annualized 0.9 percent in January-March. But some among those polled predict a contraction including Deutsche Securities, which expects the economy to shrink 1.0 percent.
The BOJ stunned markets in January by deploying negative interest rates to prevent global market volatility from hurting already frail business sentiment.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank will scrutinize the effects of negative interest rates on the economy for the time being, suggesting that no immediate expansion of stimulus was forthcoming.

But sluggish exports will likely force the BOJ to cut next fiscal year's economic and price growth forecasts at a quarterly review in April, sources said, keeping policy-makers under pressure to do more to reflate growth.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years, days after top leaders sought to reassure investors that the outlook for the world's second-largest economy remains solid.
Exports fell 25.4 percent from a year earlier, twice as much as markets had feared as demand skidded in all of China's major markets, while imports slumped 13.8 percent, the 16th straight month of decline.
The export drop was the biggest since May 2009, but economists said it may not necessarily point to a significant worsening in economic conditions due to sharply reduced business activity during the long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in early February this year.
Still, January-February exports on a combined basis, which should iron out some of the holiday effect, fell 17.8 percent and imports 16.7 percent, pointing to persistently weak demand at home and abroad that is weighing on the economy of the world's largest trading nation.
""Exports were very strong last year in February because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. So the implication is that we'll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month,"" said Julian Evans-Prichard, China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
""We suspect that overall exports remain weak but we donât see much evidence of marked deterioration, for instance there was no sudden drop-off in export orders in the Markit PMI (activity survey), and they generally do a pretty good job of adjusting for seasonality."" 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected February exports to fall by 12.5 percent, with imports seen down 10.0 percent. 
China posted a trade surplus of $32.59 billion for the month, down from $63.29 billion in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.
NEW 2016 GROWTH TARGET ALREADY AT RISK?
After missing trade goals repeatedly in recent years, China's leaders did not give an estimate for trade growth in 2016 when they set out key economic targets in parliament on Saturday, reflecting deep uncertainty about global demand.
Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said last month that he was confident that China's trade conditions would stabilize and improve in 2016, though most analysts see no improvement in sight.
""The sharp drop in imports also shatters the hope that China is rolling out a stimulus package that would boost the demand for commodities,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
""The recent rally in bulk commodities, led by iron ore, might be only short-lived."" 
Spot iron ore prices rocketed nearly 20 percent to the highest in more than eight months on Monday, buoyed by expectations that Chinese steel mills are planning an output boost ahead of an expected crackdown on air pollution.
China's iron ore imports rose 6.4 percent in Jan-Feb, though anti-dumping measures are squeezing steelmakers who are trying to keep mills running by increasing sales overseas.
Goldman Sachs, however, said the iron ore rally would not last in the absence of a significant improvement in Chinese domestic steel demand, sticking to its bearish take on one of this year's biggest commodity comebacks.
China's leaders set an economic growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for 2016 as they opened the annual session of parliament last week, compared with 6.9 percent last year, the country's slowest expansion in a quarter of a century.
As part of efforts to stimulate activity, policymakers have proposed raising the 2016 fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, from 2015's budgeted 2.3 percent.
Economists also expect further reductions this year in interest rates and the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, extending a year-long stimulus blitz. In late February, the central bank cut bank reserve ratio requirements, releasing an estimated $100 billion in cash for lending.
""Overall, today's trade data, together with high-frequency data and leading indicators, suggest that growth momentum weakened further in January-February,"" economists from Japanese bank Nomura said in a research note.
""We maintain our forecast of real GDP growth slowing to 5.8 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015."" 
Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in parliament on Saturday that leaders face ""a tough battle"" to keep the economy growing by at least 6.5 percent over the next five years, while pushing hard to create more jobs and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 2.2 percent to $45.7 billion. December's trade deficit was revised up to $44.7 billion from the previously reported $43.4 billion. Exports have declined for four straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit widening to $44.0 billion in January. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit increased to $61.97 billion from $60.09 billion in December.
Trade subtracted a quarter of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, helping to hold down growth to a tepid 1.0 percent annual rate.
In January, exports of goods fell 3.3 percent to $116.9 billion, the lowest level since November 2010. Overall exports of goods and services dropped 2.1 percent to their lowest level since June 2011.
There were declines in food exports, which were the weakest since September 2010. Industrial supplies and materials exports fell to their lowest level since March 2010. Petroleum exports also fell, touching their lowest level since September 2010.
Exports of non-petroleum products were the weakest since February 2011. Exports to the United States' main trading partners fell broadly in January.
Imports of goods fell 1.6 percent to $180.6 billion, the lowest level since February 2011. Import growth is being constrained by ongoing efforts by businesses to reduce a stockpile of unsold merchandise.
Lower oil prices as well as increased domestic energy production are also helping to curb the import bill. There were declines in imports of industrial supplies and materials.
Automobile imports were, however, the highest on record.

The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 3.7 percent to $28.9 billion in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment gains surged in February, the clearest sign yet of labor market strength that could further ease fears the economy was heading into recession and allow the Federal Reserve to gradually raise interest rates this year.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 242,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate held at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent even as more people piled into the labor market.
""This is the best news the Fed could have expected going into the meeting. With jobs bouncing back, you can be sure that rate hikes are just around the corner,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The economy added 30,000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported. The only blemish in the report was a three-cent drop in average hourly earnings, but that was mostly because of a calendar quirk.
The average length of the workweek also fell last month.
Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 last month and the jobless rate holding steady.
The employment report added to data such as consumer and business spending in suggesting the economy had regained momentum after growth slowed to a 1.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.5 percent rate.
Fears of a recession in the wake of poor economic reports in December and slowing growth in China sparked a global stock market rout at the start of the year, causing financial market conditions to tighten.
Financial markets have priced out bets of a rate rise at the Fed's March 15-16 policy meeting and see a roughly 50 percent chance of a hike at the September and November meetings, according to CME FedWatch.
Economists, however, believe the strong jobs market and improved growth outlook, together with signs that inflation is creeping up, could prompt the Fed to lift borrowing costs in June.
The Fed raised its key overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell after the data, while U.S. stock index futures rose. The U.S. dollar gained against the euro and hit session highs against the yen and Swiss franc.
SLOWER WAGE GROWTH
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.9 percent, the highest level in just over a year.
Adding to the report's strength, a broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.7 percent.
The employment-to-population ratio also increased to 59.8 percent last month, the highest since April 2009, from 59.6 percent in January.
While wage growth weakened in February, it was largely payback for January's jump, which was driven by a calendar quirk. Growth in wages is seen accelerating as the labor market settles into full employment.
The drop in average hourly earnings lowered the year-on-year gain in earnings to 2.2 percent from 2.5 percent in January. The average workweek fell to 34.4 hours from 34.6 hours in January.
In February, job gains were almost broad-based, though manufacturing and mining employment fell. The services sector created 245,000 jobs after adding 153,000 jobs in January. Mining lost a further 18,000 jobs after shedding 9,000 positions in January.
Mining payrolls have declined by 171,000 jobs since peaking in September 2014, with three-fourths of the losses in support activities. More losses are likely after oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) said last month it would cut a further 5,000 jobs because of a prolonged slump in oil prices.

Manufacturing employment lost 16,000 jobs, reversing some of January's surprise increase. Private education jobs rebounded after plunging in January. Construction payrolls increased 19,000 and government added 12,000 jobs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend continued to point to a strengthening labor market.
The labor market optimism was, however, dimmed somewhat by a survey on Thursday showing employment in the services industries fell in February for the first time in two years, even as the overall sector continued to expand. 
But economists cautioned against reading too much into the drop, noting that past declines had not translated into overall labor market weakness.
""At first glance that is a concern ... but we've seen this happen with the employment index before. There are also no other signs that service sector hiring is slowing,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Feb.27, the Labor Department said.Â Economists had forecast claims slipping to 271,000 in the latest week. 
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year. That is the longest period since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, seen as a bettermeasure of labor market trends, fell to the lowest level since late November - indicating no stress in the jobs market despite financial market conditions having tightened after fears of recession sparked a global stock market sell-off.
""Through some of the ups and downs in the weekly series, it looks like the trend in initial claims has improved over the past month, signaling that the labor market continues to improve despite weakness in several other recent economic reports,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The labor market's resilience was reinforced by another report from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc showing announced layoffs by U.S. companies tumbled 18 percent to 61,599 in February. 
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of services industries employment fell 2.4 percentage points to a reading of 49.7 percent, dropping below the 50 threshold for the first since February 2014. 
That contributed to the ISM's nonmanufacturing index dipping 0.1 percentage point to a reading of 53.4 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the U.S. services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.
STRONG PAYROLLS EXPECTED
While the weak employment reading poses a risk to Friday's jobs report for February, another survey from data firm Markit showed services industry employment held firm in February, though its overall services sector index fell to a near two-and-half year low, in part because of a blizzard that slammed the Northeast.
A report on Wednesday showed strong private sector hiring last month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs last month after rising 151,000 in January. The unemployment rate is seen steady at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks were trading modestly lower, also reflecting weaker oil prices. U.S. government debt rose marginally.
The encouraging labor market data joins reports on manufacturing and consumer spending in suggesting economic growth picked up at the start of the year after slowing to an annual rate of 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter. 
In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods rebounded 1.6 percent after dropping 2.9 percent in December. That was the largest increase since June and followed two straight months of declines.
""It should be clear to most that the recession fears were overblown,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The increase in factory orders was the latest suggestion that the worst of the factory slump was likely over.
Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut exports. Spending cuts by energy firms in the wake of a plunge in oil prices are also a drag, as are efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut. 

In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity fell at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter and not the 3.0 percent pace it reported last month. Still, labor-related costs increased solidly as companies employed more workers to raise output.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.4 from 53.5 in January. Analysts had expected the index to tick down to 53.2. The employment index fell to 49.7 from the January reading of 52.1. It is the first time the employment index has contracted since February 2014. The downbeat data indicated that weakness in the U.S. manufacturing sector is spreading to the services sector.

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders data points to easing in manufacturing slump,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods increased by the most in seven months in January, in another hopeful sign for the troubled manufacturing sector.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods rebounded 1.6 percent after an unrevised 2.9 percent drop in December. That was the largest increase since June and followed two straight months of declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 2.0 percent in January.
Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut exports. Spending cuts by energy firms in the wake of a plunge in oil prices are also a drag, as are efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.
But the worst of the factory slump appears to be over, with a survey this week showing an improvement in sentiment among manufacturers in February. A report last month showed solid gains in industrial production in January.
In January, factory orders rose broadly, with orders for transportation equipment jumping 11.4 percent.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans â rose 3.4 percent instead of the 3.9 percent increase reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.4 percent in January as previously reported.
Inventories of factory goods fell for a seventh straight month, suggesting factories were making progress in reducing the inventory glut. While that could support future manufacturing activity, it suggests inventories will again be a drag on economic growth in the first quarter.
That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at 1.36, down from 1.37 in December. Unfilled orders at factories edged up 0.1 percent in January and have now increased in three of the last four months.

The majority of the respondents' comments continue to be positive about business conditions. The respondents are projecting a slight optimism in regards to the overall economy.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims rise, trend points to firming labor market","WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend continued to point to a strengthening labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Feb.
27, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's claims were unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 271,000 in the latest week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data and only claims for Oklahoma had been estimated.
Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 52 straight weeks. That is the longest period since the early 1970s.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 270,250 last week, the lowest level since late November.
While the claims data has no bearing on Friday's employment report for February as it falls outside the survey period, it was the latest indication that the labor market remains on solid footing despite a recent tightening in financial market conditions sparked by worries of a recession.
A report on Wednesday showed strong private sector hiring last month, suggesting a pick-up in overall job growth.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs last month after rising 151,000 in January. The unemployment rate is seen steady at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 3,000 to 2.26 million in the week ended Feb. 20. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 750 to 2.26 million.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 27 increased by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 from the previous weekâs total of 272,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 271,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims have held below the 300,000-level for 51 consecutive weeks, which is usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended February 20 rose to 2.257 million from 2.254 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to dip to 2.250 million.
The four-week moving average was 270,250, a decline of 1,750 from the previous week's 272,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

Other data on Tuesday showed auto sales rising in February, with major automakers posting big gains compared to a year ago, and construction spending surging in January to the highest level since 2007, offering more evidence that the economy was regaining momentum after slowing in the fourth quarter. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity increased 1.3 percentage points to a reading of 49.5 last month, the fifth straight month of contraction.
A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
A strong dollar, weak global demand and spending cuts by energy firms following a plunge in crude oil prices have undercut manufacturing. Ongoing efforts by businesses to sell unwanted inventory have also been a drag on factory activity.
Factories said new orders held steady at slightly higher levels, though export orders fell. Inventory levels and order books appeared to be stabilizing. Factory employment also improved last month. 
The dollar rose to a near one-month high against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks rose and prices for U.S. government debt fell. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 1.5 percent to $1.14 trillion, the highest level since October 2007, as both private and public outlays rose. That followed an upwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in December, previously reported as a 0.1 percent gain. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.4 percent in January. Construction outlays were up 10.4 percent from a year ago.
The reports adds to upbeat data on consumer spending, the labor market, industrial production and durable goods orders in suggesting that economic growth picked up at the start of the first quarter after slowing to a 1.0 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2015.
First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are currently as high as a 2.7 percent pace, but the strong construction spending report could prompt economists to raise their forecasts. 
In January, construction spending was buoyed by a 0.5 percent rise in private construction projects to the highest level since November 2007.
Outlays on private nonresidential structures, which include factories and offices, rose 1.0 percent. Spending on private residential construction was unchanged in January.

Public construction outlays jumped 4.5 percent to their highest level since September 2010. Spending on state and local government construction projects, the largest portion of the public sector segment, shot up 4.4 percent. Federal government construction spending advanced 5.8 percent.

Here's the full-text of the statement:
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
Recent information suggests that the global economy is continuing to grow, though at a slightly lower pace than earlier expected. While several advanced economies have recorded improved growth over the past year, conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate has continued to moderate.Commodity prices have declined very substantially over the past couple of years. This partly reflects slower growth in demand but also, in some key instances, large increases in supply. The decline in Australia's terms of trade has continued.
Financial markets have once again exhibited heightened volatility over recent months, as participants grapple with uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy settings among the major jurisdictions. Appetite for risk has diminished somewhat and funding conditions for emerging market sovereigns and lesser-rated corporates have tightened. But funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, the available information suggests that the expansion in the non-mining parts of the economy strengthened during 2015 despite the contraction in spending in mining investment. This was reflected in improved labour market conditions. The pace of lending to businesses also picked up.Inflation is quite low. With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation is likely to remain low over the next year or two.
Given these conditions, it is appropriate for monetary policy to be accommodative. Low interest rates are supporting demand, while supervisory measures are working to emphasise prudent lending standards and so to contain risks in the housing market. Credit growth to households continues at a moderate pace, albeit with a changed composition between investors and owner-occupiers. The pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney and has remained mostly subdued in other cities. The exchange rate has been adjusting to the evolving economic outlook.
At today's meeting, the Board judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore decided that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate.
Over the period ahead, new information should allow the Board to judge whether the improvement in labour market conditions is continuing and whether the recent financial turbulence portends weaker global and domestic demand. Continued low inflation would provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 29, 2016 09:30PM ET</span>",China Feb factory activity shrinks more than expected: official PMI,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector shrank for the seventh month in a row in February and more sharply than expected, an official survey showed, suggesting the government will have to ramp up stimulus to avoid a deeper economic slowdown.
Some investors had been bracing for a negative after the central bank unexpectedly eased policy late on Monday, injecting an estimated $100 billion worth of cash into the banking system to cushion the pain of upcoming reforms such as restructuring bloated state enterprises.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in February from January's reading of 49.4 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a slight dip to 49.3.
It was the lowest reading since November, 2011, which was also 49.0
China's factory sector has been under pressure from weak demand at home and abroad and massive overcapacity in key industries such as steel and coal, making it highly resistant to the impact of six central bank interest rate cuts and a spate of other support measures since November 2014.
New export orders and total orders continued to shrink in February, prompting employers to shed jobs at
Industrial profits fell 2.3 percent in 2015 after rising 3.3 percent in 2014.
In addition, some manufacturers in capital-intensive sectors are struggling with heavy debt loads, which are becoming increasingly difficult to repay as they have to constantly cut prices to win sales. Last year witnessed a rash of bond defaults by steel, cement and chemical firms. Chinese factory gate prices fell for the 47th straight month in January.
The government has made cutting overcapacity in steel and other ""old economy"" sectors a priority this year, although previous efforts have run into strong resistance at the local level, as large industrial firms are often a key source of tax revenue and employment.
China said on Monday it expects to lay off 1.8 million workers in the coal and steel industries, or about 15 percent of the workforce, as part of efforts to reduce industrial overcapacity, but no timeframe was given.
Recent tax policy changes have also raised concerns that China hopes to export more of its excess industrial capacity abroad, further worsening global gluts of key chemical and steel products.
China's economic growth cooled to 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years, and economists see it slowing further to around 6.5 percent this year. Some market watchers believe it is already much weaker than official data suggests.
SERVICES SOFTENING?
China's services sector, which has been taking up an increasing amount of economic slack as manufacturing cools, continued to expand in February but at its slowest pace since late 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.7 from January's 53.5, but remained well in expansionary territory, according to a similar sector survey by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
With manufacturing in a prolonged funk, Beijing has been keen to grow the services sector and make consumption a stronger driver of the economy. But analysts have wondered how long services can remain resilient in the face of the deepening drag from the factory slump and widely expected layoffs.

1612,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 29, 2016 09:00PM ET</span>","China Caixin PMI drops further to 48, below expected 48.3","Investing.com - China's Caixin PMI for February came in at 48, below the 48.3 expected and last month's level of 48.4, placing it in contraction for 12 straight months. A figure below 50 suggests contraction.
Payroll numbers were cut at fastest pace since the start of 2009, according to the Caixin number, while stocks of finished goods fell at quickest rate since September 2011.
""The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI for February is 48, down 0.4 points from the previous month. The index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signalled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy's road to stability remains bumpy. The government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff,"" said He Fan, the chief economist of Caixin Insight Group.
Earlier in China, the semi-official manufacturing PMI for February fell to 49, weaker than the 49.3 expected and last month's 49.4 level, while the non-manufacturing PMI came in at 52.7, below the last reported at 53.5.
For the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing manufacturing it was its weakest level since November 2011.
The CFLP said in an accompanying statement that production, new orders and amount of purchase fell sharply in February because of the week-long Chinese Newyear holiday. Input prices for iron and steel and non-ferrous metal industries saw marked increases. If the recovery momentum becomes a trend, it will help to improve companies profitability and further boost production,"" said the CFLP.
The CFLP also noted a spike in the sub-index measuring business expectations, jumping to 57.9 in February from 44.4 in January, suggesting strong confidence by Chinese companies over the future outlook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell to their lowest level in a year in January amid a persistent shortage of properties for sale, which could slow the housing market ahead of the spring selling season. 
Other reports on Monday showed factory activity contracting in the Midwest and remaining subdued in Texas this month as the manufacturing sector continued to be buffeted by a strong dollar, weak global demand and spending cuts by energy firms.
But coming on the heels of recent strong data on consumer spending, the labor market, industrial production and durable goods orders, Monday's reports did little to change the view that the economy was regaining momentum after slowing to a 1.0 percent annual rate in the first quarter. 
""The disappointing data tone points to ongoing weakness in the housing and manufacturing sectors,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
""Nevertheless, with underlying domestic fundamentals remaining supportive to growth, the economic recovery should regain its footing in the first quarter."" 
Growth estimates for the first quarter are above a 2 percent rate.
The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined 2.5 percent to 106.0 last month, the lowest level since January of last year. The NAR attributed the drop to tight housing inventories, which are limiting choice for potential buyers and pushing up home prices.
A massive snowstorm that blanketed the Northeast region in late January was also blamed for the decline in signed contracts. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.5 percent last month.
HOUSING STILL RECOVERING
U.S. stocks were trading higher after China moved to boost its slowing economy and rising oil prices buoyed investor sentiment. The dollar (DXY) firmed slightly against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose. 
Pending home sales become sales after a month or two, and January's unexpected drop suggested home resales will likely weaken after rising only 0.4 percent last month. Contracts were up 1.4 percent from a year ago. 
Pending home sales tumbled 3.2 percent in the Northeast and plunged 4.9 percent in the Midwest. They rose 0.3 percent in the South, but decreased 4.5 percent in the West, which has seen a rapid increase in home prices amid tight inventories.
""While pending home sales have been weak lately, some other housing indicators, including the mortgage purchase application data reported through most of February have looked strong, giving us hope the housing market is continuing to recover,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (N:JPM) in New York.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its purchasing managers index fell 8.0 points to 47.6 in February as production, new orders and order backlogs declined sharply.
Factory employment in the Chicago area fell to its lowest level since November 2009 and firms continued to draw down stocks in February, with inventories remaining in contraction for a fourth straight month.
A third report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed manufacturing activity in Texas contracted in February, though the pace of decline slowed. 
The Dallas Fed's Texas manufacturing index was at -31.8 this month compared to a reading of -34.6 in January. Texas is one of the states that have been hard hit by the oil price rout.
The factory reports came ahead of the release on Tuesday of the Institute for Supply Management's national manufacturing survey, which is expected to show some stabilization in the downtrodden factory sector.

""We still think the restraining effects on manufacturing growth are beginning to diminish, particularly as far as any currency effects on growth are concerned,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its pending home sales index sank by a seasonally adjusted 2.5% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 0.5%. Pending home sales in December increased by 0.9%, whose figure was revised up from a previously reported rise of 0.1%.
Year-on-year, pending home sales rose at annualized rate of 1.4%, following a gain of 4.2% in the prior month.
NAR noted that the decrease came after highest average year for the index in nearly a decade and said that only the South showed an uptick in activity in the first month of the year.
""While Januaryâs blizzard possibly caused some of the pullback in the Northeast, the recent acceleration in home prices and minimal inventory throughout the country appears to be the primary obstacle holding back would-be buyers,â Larry Yun, NAR chief economist, said. âAdditionally, some buyers could be waiting for a hike in listings come springtime,â he added.

1625,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 29, 2016 09:47AM ET</span>",Chicago PMI plunges to 47.6 in February,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the Chicago-area in February contracted for the fourth time in the past six months, dampening optimism over the U.S. economic outlook, industry data showed on Monday.
In a report, market research group Kingsbury International said its Chicago purchasing managersâ index tumbled by 8.0 points to a seasonally adjusted 47.6 this month from a reading of 55.6 in January. Analysts had expected the index to fall 2.6 points to 53.0 in February.
The Barometerâs decline was led by an 18.5 drop in Production, which completely reversed Januaryâs near 16 point gain, pushing it back into contraction.
New Orders also fell sharply and Order Backlogs slipped further into contraction, a situation that has persisted for a year.
Employment also declined significantly, leaving it at the lowest since November 2009 and the fifth consecutive month below 50.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Chief Economist of MNI Indicators Philip Uglow said, âIf one looks beyond the gyrations seen over the past three months then trend activity has been running a little below the 50 neutral mark, highlighting continued sluggish activity levels, with manufacturers under particular pressure.â

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2016 09:30AM ET</span>",U.S. fourth-quarter GDP growth revised higher on strong inventory investment,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as initially thought, with businesses less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory, which could hurt output in the first three months of 2016.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.0 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that fourth-quarter GDP growth would be revised down to a 0.4 percent pace. The economy grew at a rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent in 2015.
U.S. stock index futures extended gains after the data, while prices of Treasuries fell. The dollar (DXY) added to gains against a basket of currencies.
Businesses accumulated $81.7 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter rather than the $68.6 billion reported last month. The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining, utilities and construction.
As a result, inventories subtracted only 0.14 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.45 percentage point.
The bigger inventory build is bad news for first-quarter GDP growth as it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders, which will continue to hold down production.
""The weaker drag from inventories in the fourth quarter means that any rebound in the first quarter could be slightly more modest than we previously expected,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
""Nevertheless, it still appears that first-quarter GDP growth is on track to rebound to a very healthy 2.5 percent annualized or higher, which should dampen any concerns about an imminent recession.""
DOWNSIDE RISKS
First-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as a 2.5 percent rate, but the risks are tilted to the downside amid slowing world economies, a strong dollar and a recent global stock market sell-off that has tightened financial market conditions.
Cheap oil has also been a drag on the profits of oil field companies such as Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL), prompting them to slash capital expenditure budgets.
The upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP growth also reflected a smaller trade deficit than initially thought as imports contracted. The trade deficit subtracted 0.25 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the 0.47 percentage point reported last month.
Business spending on equipment contracted at a less steep 1.8 percent rate last quarter, compared to the previously reported 2.5 percent rate.
There was a small downward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 2.0 percent pace rather than the 2.2 percent rate reported last month.
Unusually mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel in December and undermined demand for heating. But there are signs consumption picked up in January with the return to more normal winter temperatures.
With gasoline prices around $2 per gallon, a tightening labor market gradually lifting wages and house prices boosting household wealth, the fundamentals for consumer spending remain quite strong.
Business spending on nonresidential structures contracted at a 6.6 percent rate rather than the 5.3 percent pace reported last month. Government spending contracted at a 0.1 percent rate instead of rising at a 0.7 percent rate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales tumbled in January from a 10-month high as sales in the West region plunged, but the overall housing market recovery remains intact.
Other data on Wednesday showed the services sector contracted in early February for the first time since October 2013 amid concerns about the economic outlook. Bad weather also hampered activity in the vast services sector.
The Commerce Department said single-family home sales dropped 9.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000 units, almost unwinding December's sharp increase. December's sales pace was unrevised at 544,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 8.3 percent of the housing market, slipping to only a 520,000 unit-rate last month.
Sales in the West, which has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories, plummeted 32.1 percent to a 110,000 unit-rate, the lowest level since July 2014. The percent decline was the largest since May 2010.
Sales rose 3.4 percent in the Northeast, despite a blizzard in late January. They fell 5.9 percent in the Midwest and rose 1.8 percent in the populous South. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors kept an eye on declining oil prices. 
Though the new homes market appears to have cooled, with construction activity falling in January and homebuilder sentiment softening in February, housing in general remains supported by a tightening labor market, which is lifting wage growth and bolstering household formation. Reports on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes hitting a six-month high in January and house prices rising 5.7 percent in the year to December. While mortgage applications fell last week, they retained half of the prior week's increase.
In a separate report, data firm Markit said its flash U.S. services PMI business activity index fell to 49.8 early this month from a reading of 53.2 in January. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in services sector activity.
But with respondents also blaming the harsh weather in the Northeast, the decline in the index probably exaggerates the slowdown in the services sector. 
A firmer housing market should help to prop up the economy as it navigates rough seas caused by a robust dollar, spending cuts by energy firms hurt by lower oil prices and sluggish global demand. Efforts by businesses to sell off inventory are holding back growth. The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are currently above a 2 percent rate.
Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market increased 2.1 percent to 238,000 units, the highest since October 2009. Still, housing stock remains tight.

At January's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.1 months in December. The median price of a new home fell 4.5 percent from a year ago to $278,800.
